diabetes,what is diabetes? Tell me about diabetes? What kind of disease is diabetes? Can you elaborate on diabetes? What can you tell me about diabetes? Could you describe what diabetes is? I�d like to know more about diabetes. Can you help? What information do you have on diabetes? Could you provide information on diabetes?,"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease that causes high blood sugar. Your body either doesn�t make enough insulin or can�t effectively use the insulin it makes.
The hormone insulin moves sugar from the blood into your cells to be stored or used for energy. If this malfunctions, you may have diabetes.
Untreated high blood sugar from diabetes can damage your nerves, eyes, kidneys, and other organs. But educating yourself about diabetes and taking steps to prevent or manage it can help you protect your health."
diabetes,"for diabetes, types of diabetes?","There are a few different types of diabetes:
Type 1: Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. The immune system attacks and destroys cells in the pancreas, where insulin is made. It�s unclear what causes this attack.
Type 2: Type 2 diabetes occurs when your body becomes resistant to insulin, and sugar builds up in your blood. It�s the most common type�about 90% to 95%
of people living with diabetes have type 2.
Type 1.5: Type 1.5 diabetes is also known as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). It occurs during adulthood and sets in gradually like type 2 diabetes. LADA is an autoimmune disease that cannot be treated by diet or lifestyle.
Gestational: Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar during pregnancy. Insulin-blocking hormones produced by the placenta cause this type of diabetes.
A rare condition called diabetes insipidus is not related to diabetes mellitus, although it has a similar name. It�s a different condition in which your kidneys remove too much fluid from your body.
Each type of diabetes has unique symptoms, causes, and treatments.
Learn more about how these types differ from one another."
diabetes,"for diabetes, prediabetes?","Prediabetes is the term that�s used when your blood sugar is higher than expected, but it�s not high enough for a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. It occurs when the cells in your body don�t respond to insulin the way they should. This can lead to type 2 diabetes down the road.
Experts suggest that more than 1 in 3 Americans
have prediabetes, but over 80%
of people with prediabetes don�t even know it."
diabetes,"for diabetes, symptoms of diabetes?","Diabetes symptoms are caused by rising blood sugar.
General symptoms
The symptoms of type 1, type 2, and type 1.5 (LADA) are the same, but they occur in a shorter period than types 2 and 1.5. In type 2, the onset tends to be slower. Tingling nerves and slow-healing sores are more common in type 2.
Left untreated, type 1, in particular, can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. This is when there is a dangerous level of ketones in the body. It�s less common in other types of diabetes, but still possible.
The general symptoms of diabetes include:
increased hunger
increased thirst
weight loss
frequent urination
blurry vision
extreme fatigue
sores that don�t heal
Symptoms in men
In addition to the general symptoms of diabetes, men with diabetes may have:
a decreased sex drive
erectile dysfunction
poor muscle strength
Symptoms in women
Women with diabetes can have symptoms such as:
vaginal dryness
urinary tract infections
yeast infections
dry, itchy skin
Gestational diabetes
Most people who develop gestational diabetes don�t have any symptoms. Healthcare professionals often detect the condition during a routine blood sugar test or oral glucose tolerance test, which is usually performed between the 24th and 28th weeks of pregnancy.
In rare cases, a person with gestational diabetes will also experience increased thirst or urination.
The bottom line
Diabetes symptoms can be so mild that they�re hard to spot at first. Learn which signs should prompt a trip to the doctor."
diabetes,"for diabetes, causes of diabetes?","Different causes are associated with each type of diabetes.
Type 1 diabetes
Doctors don�t know exactly what causes type 1 diabetes. For some reason, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.
Genes may play a role in some people. It�s also possible that a virus sets off an immune system attack.
Type 2 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes stems from a combination of genetics and lifestyle factors. Having overweight or obesity increases your risk, too. Carrying extra weight, especially in your belly, makes your cells more resistant to the effects of insulin on your blood sugar.
This condition runs in families. Family members share genes that make them more likely to get type 2 diabetes and to be overweight.
Type 1.5 diabetes
Type 1.5 is an autoimmune condition that occurs when the pancreas is attacked by your own antibodies. as in type 1. It may be genetic, but more research is needed.
Gestational diabetes
Gestational diabetes occurs as the result of hormonal changes during pregnancy. The placenta produces hormones that make a pregnant person�s cells less sensitive to the effects of insulin. This can cause high blood sugar during pregnancy.
People who are overweight when they get pregnant or who gain too much weight during pregnancy are more likely to get gestational diabetes.
The bottom line
Both genes and environmental factors play a role in triggering diabetes.
Get more information on the causes of diabetes."
diabetes,"for diabetes, diabetes risk factors?","Certain factors increase your risk for diabetes.
Type 1 diabetes
You�re more likely to get type 1 diabetes if you�re a child or teenager, you have a parent or sibling with the condition, or you carry certain genes that are linked to the disease.
Type 2 diabetes
Your risk for type 2 diabetes increases if you:
are overweight
are age 45 or older
have a parent or sibling with the condition
aren�t physically active
have had gestational diabetes
have prediabetes
have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or high triglycerides
Type 2 diabetes also disproportionately affects certain racial and ethnic populations.
Adults who have African American, Hispanic or Latino American, or Asian American ancestry are more likely to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes than white adults, according to 2016 research. They�re also more likely to experience decreased quality of care and increased barriers to self-management.
Type 1.5 diabetes
Type 1.5 diabetes is found in adults over 30 and is often mistaken for type 2, but people with this condition are not necessarily overweight, and oral medications and lifestyle changes have no effect.
Gestational diabetes
Your risk for gestational diabetes increases if you:
are overweight
are over age 25
had gestational diabetes during a past pregnancy
have given birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds
have a family history of type 2 diabetes
have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
The bottom line
Your family history, environment, and preexisting medical conditions can all affect your odds of developing diabetes.

diabetes,"for diabetes, diabetes complications?","High blood sugar damages organs and tissues throughout your body. The higher your blood sugar is and the longer you live with it, the greater your risk for complications.
Complications associated with diabetes include:
heart disease, heart attack, and stroke
neuropathy
nephropathy
retinopathy and vision loss
hearing loss
foot damage, such as infections and sores that don�t heal
skin conditions, such as bacterial and fungal infections

Gestational diabetes
Unmanaged gestational diabetes can lead to problems that affect both the mother and baby. Complications affecting the baby can include:
premature birth
higher-than-typical weight at birth
increased risk for type 2 diabetes later in life
low blood sugar
jaundice
stillbirth
A pregnant person with gestational diabetes can develop complications such as high blood pressure (preeclampsia) or type 2 diabetes. You may also require cesarean delivery, commonly referred to as a C-section.
The risk of gestational diabetes in future pregnancies also increases.

diabetes,"for diabetes, treatment of diabetes?","Doctors treat diabetes with a few different medications. Some are taken by mouth, while others are available as injections.
Type 1 and 1.5 diabetes
Insulin is the main treatment for type 1 and 1.5 diabetes. It replaces the hormone your body isn�t able to produce.
Various types of insulin are commonly used by people with type 1 and 1.5 diabetes. They differ in how quickly they start to work and how long their effects last:
Rapid-acting insulin: starts to work within 15 minutes and its effects last for 2 to 4 hours
Short-acting insulin: starts to work within 30 minutes and lasts 3 to 6 hours
Intermediate-acting insulin: starts to work within 2 to 4 hours and lasts 12 to 18 hours
Long-acting insulin: starts to work 2 hours after injection and lasts up to 24 hours
Ultra-long acting insulin: starts to work 6 hours after injection and lasts 36 hours or more
Premixed insulin: starts working within 15 to 30 minutes (depending on whether a rapid-acting or short-acting insulin is part of the mix) and lasts 10 to 16 hours
Type 2 diabetes
Diet and exercise can help some people manage type 2 diabetes. If lifestyle changes aren�t enough to lower your blood sugar, you�ll need to take medication.
These drugs lower your blood sugar in a variety of ways:
Drug How it works Examples
alpha-glucosidase inhibitors slow your body�s breakdown of sugars and starchy foods acarbose (Precose) and miglitol
biguanides reduce the amount of glucose your liver makes metformin (Glucophage, Riomet)
DPP-4 inhibitors improve your blood sugar without making it drop too low alogliptin (Nesina), linagliptin (Tradjenta), saxagliptin (Onglyza), and sitagliptin (Januvia)
glucagon-like peptides stimulate your pancreas to produce more insulin; slow stomach emptying semaglutide (Ozempic), dulaglutide (Trulicity), exenatide (Byetta), and liraglutide (Victoza)
meglitinides stimulate your pancreas to release more insulin nateglinide and repaglinide
SGLT2 inhibitors release more glucose into the urine canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), and empagliflozin (Jardiance)
sulfonylureas stimulate your pancreas to release more insulin glyburide (Glynase), glipizide (Glucotrol), and glimepiride (Amaryl)
thiazolidinediones help insulin work better pioglitazone (Actos) and rosiglitazone
You may need to take more than one of these medications. Some people with type 2 diabetes also take insulin.
Gestational diabetes
If you receive a diagnosis of gestational diabetes, you�ll need to monitor your blood sugar level several times per day during pregnancy. If it�s high, dietary changes and exercise may be enough to bring it down.
Research has found that about 15% to 30%
of women who develop gestational diabetes will need insulin to lower their blood sugar. Insulin is safe for the developing baby.
The bottom line
The treatment regimen your doctor recommends will depend on the type of diabetes you have and its cause.
Check out this list of the various medications that are available to treat diabetes."
diabetes,"for diabetes, diabetes and diet?","Healthy eating is a central part of managing diabetes. In some cases, changing your diet may be enough to manage the disease.
Types 1 and 1.5 diabetes
Your blood sugar level rises or falls based on the types of foods you eat. Starchy or sugary foods make blood sugar levels rise rapidly. Protein and fat cause more gradual increases.
Your medical team may recommend that you limit the amount of carbohydrates you eat each day. You�ll also need to balance your carb intake with your insulin doses. Counting carbs helps to balance the carb intake with the insulin doses.
Check out this guide to starting a type 1 diabetes diet.
Type 2 diabetes
Eating the right types of foods can both manage your blood sugar and help you lose any excess weight.
Carb counting is an important part of eating for type 2 diabetes. A dietitian can help you figure out how many grams of carbohydrates to eat at each meal.
In order to keep your blood sugar levels steady, try to eat small meals throughout the day. Emphasize healthy foods such as:
fruits
vegetables
whole grains
lean protein such as poultry and fish
healthy fats such as olive oil and nuts
Certain other foods can hurt efforts to manage your blood sugar.
Discover the foods you should avoid if you have diabetes.
Gestational diabetes
Eating a well-balanced diet is important for both you and your baby during these 9 months. Making the right food choices can also help you avoid diabetes medications.
Watch your portion sizes, and limit sugary or salty foods. Although you need some sugar to feed your growing baby, you should avoid eating too much. Check out other do�s and don�ts for healthy eating with gestational diabetes.
The bottom line
Work with a registered dietitian if you have access to one. They can help you design an individualized diabetes meal plan. Getting the right balance of protein, fat, and carbs can help you manage your blood sugar."
diabetes,"for diabetes, diabetes and exercise?","Along with diet and treatment, exercise plays an essential role in diabetes management. This is true for all types of diabetes.
Staying active helps your cells react to insulin more effectively and lower your blood sugar levels. Exercising regularly can also help you:
reach and maintain a healthy weight
reduce your risk of diabetes-related health complications
boost mood
get better sleep
improve memory
If you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, general guidance is to aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week. There are currently no separate exercise guidelines for people who have gestational diabetes. But if you�re pregnant, start out slowly and gradually increase your activity level over time to avoid overdoing it.
Diabetes-friendly exercises include:
walking
swimming
dancing
cycling
Talk with your doctor about safe ways to incorporate activity into your diabetes management plan. You may need to follow special precautions, like checking your blood sugar before and after working out and making sure to stay hydrated.
Consider working with a personal trainer or exercise physiologist who has experience working with people who have diabetes. They can help you develop a personalized workout plan tailored to your needs."
diabetes,"for diabetes, diabetes diagnosis?","Anyone who has symptoms of diabetes or is at risk for the condition should be tested. People are routinely tested for gestational diabetes during their second trimester or third trimester of pregnancy.
Doctors use these blood tests to diagnose prediabetes and diabetes:
The fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test measures your blood sugar after you�ve fasted for 8 hours.
The A1C test provides a snapshot of your blood sugar levels over the previous 3 months.
A 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test is also used. This checks the BG 2 hours after ingesting a sugary drink containing 75 grams of carbs.
How to diagnose gestational diabetes
To diagnose gestational diabetes, your doctor will test your blood sugar levels between the 24th week and 28th week of pregnancy. There are two types of tests:
Glucose challenge test: During a glucose challenge test, your blood sugar is checked an hour after you drink a sugary liquid. If your results are standard, no more testing is done. If blood sugar levels are high, you�ll need to undergo a glucose tolerance test.
Glucose tolerance test: During a glucose tolerance test, your blood sugar is checked after you fast overnight. Then you�re given a sugary drink and your blood sugar is re-tested after 1 hour and again after 2 hours. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed if any of these three readings come back noting high blood sugar.
The earlier you are diagnosed with diabetes, the sooner you can start treatment. Find out whether you should get tested, and get more information on tests your doctor might perform.
If you don�t already have a primary care specialist, you can browse doctors in your area through the Healthline FindCare tool."
diabetes,"for diabetes, diabetes prevention?","Type 1 and type 1.5 diabetes are not preventable because they are caused by an issue with the immune system. Some causes of type 2 diabetes, such as your genes or age, aren�t under your control either.
Yet many other diabetes risk factors are manageable. Most diabetes prevention strategies involve making simple adjustments to your diet and fitness routine.
If you�ve received a diagnosis of prediabetes, here are a few things you can do to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes:
Get at least 150 minutes per week of aerobic exercises like walking or cycling.
Cut saturated and trans fats, along with refined carbohydrates, out of your diet.
Eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
Eat smaller portions.
Try to lose 5% to 7%
of your body weight if you have overweight or obesity.
These aren�t the only ways to prevent diabetes. Discover more strategies that may help you avoid this chronic health condition."
diabetes,"for diabetes, diabetes in pregnancy?","People who�ve never had diabetes can suddenly develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy. Hormones produced by the placenta can make your body more resistant to the effects of insulin.
Pre-gestational diabetes
People can have diabetes before they conceive and carry it with them into pregnancy. This is called pre-gestational diabetes.
Risks to your newborn
Diabetes during pregnancy can lead to complications for your newborn, such as jaundice or breathing problems.
If you�re diagnosed with pre-gestational or gestational diabetes, you�ll need special monitoring to prevent complications.
Does gestational diabetes disappear on its own?
Gestational diabetes should go away after you deliver, but it does significantly increase your risk of getting diabetes later. About half
of people with gestational diabetes will go on to develop type 2 diabetes."
diabetes,"for diabetes, diabetes in children?","Children can get both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Managing blood sugar is especially important in young people because diabetes can damage important organs such as the heart and kidneys.
Type 1 diabetes
The autoimmune form of diabetes often starts in childhood. One of the main symptoms is increased urination. Kids with type 1 diabetes may start wetting the bed after they�ve been toilet trained.
Extreme thirst, fatigue, and hunger are also signs of the condition. It�s important that children with type 1 diabetes get treatment right away. The condition can cause high blood sugar, dehydration, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which can be medical emergencies.
Type 2 diabetes
Type 1 diabetes used to be called juvenile diabetes because type 2 was so rare in children. Now that more children have overweight or obesity, type 2 diabetes is becoming more common in this age group.
Some children living with type 2 diabetes don�t experience symptoms. Others may experience:
increased thirst
frequent urination
extreme fatigue
blurry vision
Type 2 diabetes is often diagnosed based on medical history, a physical exam, and bloodwork.
Untreated type 2 diabetes can cause lifelong complications, including heart disease, kidney disease, and blindness. Healthy eating and exercise can help your child manage their blood sugar and prevent these problems.
Type 2 diabetes is more prevalent than ever in young people. Learn how to spot the signs so you can report them to your child�s doctor."
diabetes,"for diabetes, takeaway?","Some types of diabetes � like types 1 and 1.5 � are caused by factors that are out of your control. Others � like type 2 � can be prevented by making better food choices, increasing activity, and losing weight.

Types of depression
MDD is one type of depression. Other types include:
Persistent depressive disorder
Bipolar disorder
Seasonal affective disorder
Psychotic depression
Peripartum (postpartum) depression
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder
Situational depression
Atypical depression
Treatment-resistant depression"
depression mental or depressive disorder,"for depression mental or depressive disorder, what are the symptoms of major depressive disorder??","A doctor or a mental health professional can diagnose MDD based on your symptoms, feelings, and behaviors.
Typically, you�ll be asked specific questions or given a questionnaire so health professionals can better determine whether you have MDD or another condition.
To be diagnosed with MDD, you need to meet the symptom criteria listed in the �Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5).� This manual helps medical professionals diagnose mental health conditions.
According to its criteria:
You must experience a change in your previous functioning.
Symptoms must occur for a period of 2 or more weeks.
At least one symptom is either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure.
You must also experience five or more of the following symptoms in the 2-week period:
You feel sad or irritable most of the day, nearly every day.
You�re less interested in most activities you once enjoyed.
You suddenly lose or gain weight or have a change in appetite.
You have trouble falling asleep or want to sleep more than usual.
You experience feelings of restlessness.
You feel unusually tired and have a lack of energy.
You feel worthless or guilty, often about things that wouldn�t usually make you feel that way.
You have difficulty concentrating, thinking, or making decisions.
You think about harming yourself or suicide.
Symptoms in different age groups
Symptoms in teens
Symptoms parents should be aware of in their teens include the following:
onset or increased use of substances (i.e., alcohol, smoking)
poorer academic performance
problems with peers
increased social withdrawal/isolation
Symptoms in older adults
Depression symptoms in older adults are similar to other age groups. It�s often the cause of physical pain in older adults that�s not explained by other medical conditions.
Depression is common
in people with Alzheimer�s and related dementias. It�s sometimes called geriatric depression.
Older adults with one chronic health condition are 80%

depression mental or depressive disorder,"for depression mental or depressive disorder, what causes major depressive disorder??","The exact cause of MDD isn�t known. However, several factors can increase
your risk of developing the condition.
A combination
of genes and stress can affect brain chemistry and lower your ability to maintain mood stability.
Changes in the balance of hormones might also contribute to the development of MDD.
MDD may also be triggered by:
alcohol
or drug use
certain medical conditions, such as cancer or hypothyroidism
particular types of medications, including steroids
abuse during childhood"
depression mental or depressive disorder,"for depression mental or depressive disorder, how is major depressive disorder treated??","MDD is often treated with medication and psychotherapy. Some lifestyle adjustments can also help ease certain symptoms.
People who have severe MDD or have thoughts of harming themselves may need to stay in a hospital during treatment. Some might also need to take part in an outpatient treatment program until symptoms improve.
Medications
Primary care professionals often start treatment for MDD by prescribing antidepressant medications.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
SSRIs are a frequently prescribed type of antidepressant. SSRIs work by helping inhibit the breakdown of serotonin in your brain, resulting in higher amounts of this neurotransmitter.
Serotonin is a brain chemical that�s believed to be responsible for mood. It may help improve mood and produce healthy sleeping patterns.
People with MDD are often thought to have low levels of serotonin. An SSRI may relieve symptoms of MDD by increasing the amount of serotonin available in your brain.
SSRIs include well-known drugs such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and citalopram (Celexa). They have a relatively low incidence of side effects that most people tolerate well.
Similar to SSRIs, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are another type of antidepressant that are often prescribed. These affect serotonin and norepinephrine, which helps manage your fight-or-flight response.
Other medications
Tricyclic antidepressants and medications known as atypical antidepressants, such as bupropion (Wellbutrin), may be used when other drugs haven�t helped.
These drugs can cause several side effects, including weight gain and sleepiness. As with any medication, benefits and side effects need to be weighed carefully with a healthcare professional.
Stopping medications immediately can cause withdrawal symptoms. It�s important not to stop taking your medications unless a mental health or healthcare professional advises you to.
Some medications used to treat MDD aren�t safe while you�re pregnant or nursing. Make sure you speak with a healthcare professional if you become pregnant, you�re planning to become pregnant, or you�re nursing.
Psychotherapy
Psychotherapy, also known as psychological therapy or talk therapy, can effectively treat people with MDD. It involves meeting with a mental health professional regularly to talk about your condition and related issues.
Psychotherapy can help you:
adjust to a crisis or other stressful event
working toward achieving a balanced perspective of a given situation and acting in accordance with values instead of based on mood
improve your communication skills
find better ways to cope with challenges and solve problems
increase your self-esteem
regain a sense of satisfaction and control in your life
A mental health professional may also recommend other types of therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy. If you don�t already have a mental health professional, the Healthline FindCare tool can help you find a professional in your area.
Another possible treatment is group therapy, which allows you to share your feelings with people who can relate to what you�re going through.

Lifestyle changes
In addition to taking medications and participating in therapy, you can help improve MDD symptoms by making some changes to your daily habits.
Dietary changes
Nutritious foods benefit your mind and body. While no foods can cure depression, certain healthful food choices can benefit your mental well-being.
Consider eating foods:
containing
omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon
rich
in B vitamins, such as beans and whole grains
with
magnesium, which is found in nuts, seeds, and yogurt
These can also be found in supplement form, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hasn�t approved any natural products for depression. Speak with a healthcare professional before starting new supplements, especially if you take other medications.
Avoid alcohol and certain processed foods
It�s beneficial to avoid alcohol because it�s a nervous system depressant that worsens your symptoms. It has also been identified as a potential risk factor for depression.
Ultra-processed foods have also been associated
with depressive symptoms.
Get plenty of exercise
Although MDD can make you feel very tired, it�s essential
to be physically active. Exercising, especially outdoors and in moderate sunlight, can boost your mood and make you feel better.
Sleep well
It�s vital to get enough sleep each night. This can vary from person to person but typically ranges between 7 to 9 hours
.
People with depression often
have trouble sleeping. Speak with a doctor if you�re having trouble sleeping or oversleeping.
SAMHSA�s National Helpline

obstructive sleep apnea
emotional stress
excessive alcohol consumption
history of preeclampsia during pregnancy
The risk for CAD also increases with age. Based on age alone as a risk factor, men have a greater risk for the disease beginning at age 45 and women have a greater risk beginning at age 55. The risk for coronary artery disease is also higher if you have a family history of the disease."
coronary arteriosclerosis or coronary heart disease,"for coronary arteriosclerosis or coronary heart disease, coronary artery disease diagnosis?","Diagnosing CAD requires a review of your medical history, a physical examination, and other medical testing. These tests include:
Electrocardiogram: This test monitors electrical signals that travel through your heart. It may help your doctor determine whether you�ve had a heart attack.
Echocardiogram: This imaging test uses ultrasound waves to create a picture of your heart. The results of this test reveal whether certain things in your heart are functioning properly.
Stress test: This particular test measures the stress on your heart during physical activity and while at rest. The test monitors your heart�s electrical activity while you walk on a treadmill or ride a stationary bike. Nuclear imaging or echocardiographic imaging may also be performed for a portion of this test. For those unable to perform physical exercise, certain medications can be used instead for stress testing.
Cardiac catheterization (left heart catheterization): During this procedure, your doctor injects a special dye into your coronary arteries through a catheter inserted through an artery in your groin or wrist. The dye helps enhance the radiographic image of your coronary arteries to identify any blockages.
Heart CT scan: Your doctor may use this imaging test to check for calcium deposits in your arteries."
coronary arteriosclerosis or coronary heart disease,"for coronary arteriosclerosis or coronary heart disease, coronary artery disease anatomy?","The four primary coronary arteries are located on the surface of the heart:
right main coronary artery
left main coronary artery
left circumflex artery
left anterior descending artery
These arteries bring oxygen and nutrient-rich blood to your heart. Your heart is a muscle that�s responsible for pumping blood throughout your body and needs oxygen all the time. A healthy heart moves approximately 3,000 gallons of blood through your body every day.
Like any other organ or muscle, your heart must receive an adequate, dependable supply of blood in order to carry out its work. Reduced blood flow to your heart can cause symptoms of CAD."
coronary arteriosclerosis or coronary heart disease,"for coronary arteriosclerosis or coronary heart disease, what is the treatment for cad??","It�s important to reduce or control your risk factors and seek treatment to lower the chance of a heart attack or stroke if you�re diagnosed with CAD.
Treatment also depends on your current health condition, risk factors, and overall wellbeing. For example, your doctor may prescribe medication therapy to treat high cholesterol or high blood pressure, or you may receive medication to control blood sugar if you have diabetes.
Medications are the most common treatment for CAD. Learn more here.
Lifestyle changes can also reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke. For example:
quit smoking tobacco
reduce or stop your consumption of alcohol
exercise regularly
lose weight to a healthy level
eat a healthy diet (low in saturated fat, sodium, and added sugar)
If your condition doesn�t improve with lifestyle changes and medication, your doctor may recommend a procedure to increase blood flow to your heart. These procedures may be:
balloon angioplasty: to widen blocked arteries and smoosh down the plaque buildup, usually performed with insertion of a stent to help keep the lumen open after the procedure
coronary artery bypass graft surgery: to restore blood flow to the heart in open chest surgery
enhanced external counterpulsation: to stimulate the formation of new small blood vessels to naturally bypass clogged arteries in a noninvasive procedure"
coronary arteriosclerosis or coronary heart disease,"for coronary arteriosclerosis or coronary heart disease, what is the outlook for cad??","Everyone�s outlook for CAD is different. You have better chances of preventing extensive damage to your heart the earlier you can start your treatment or implement lifestyle changes.
It is important to follow your doctor�s instructions. Take medications as directed and make the recommended lifestyle changes. If you have a higher risk for CAD, you can help to prevent the disease by reducing your risk factors."
pneumonia,what is pneumonia? Tell me about pneumonia? What kind of disease is pneumonia? Can you elaborate on pneumonia? What can you tell me about pneumonia? Could you describe what pneumonia is? I�d like to know more about pneumonia. Can you help? What information do you have on pneumonia? Could you provide information on pneumonia?,"Pneumonia is an infection caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. It leads to inflammation in the air sacs of one or both lungs. These sacs, called alveoli, fill with fluid or pus, making it difficult to breathe.
Both viral and bacterial pneumonia is contagious. This means they can spread from person to person through inhalation of airborne droplets from a sneeze or cough.
You can also get these types of pneumonia by coming into contact with surfaces or objects that are contaminated with pneumonia-causing bacteria or viruses.
You can contract fungal pneumonia from the environment. It does not spread from person to person.
Pneumonia is further classified according to where or how it was acquired:
Walking pneumonia is a milder case of pneumonia. People with walking pneumonia may not even know they have pneumonia. Their symptoms may feel more like a mild respiratory infection than pneumonia. However, walking pneumonia may require a longer recovery period.
The symptoms of walking pneumonia can include things like:
Viruses and bacteria, like Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae, often cause pneumonia. However, in walking pneumonia, the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae most commonly causes the condition.
Pneumonia may be classified based off the area of the lungs it�s affecting:
Bronchopneumonia can affect areas throughout both of your lungs. It�s often localized close to or around your bronchi. These are the tubes that lead from your windpipe to your lungs.
Lobar pneumonia affects one or more lobes of your lungs. Each lung is made of lobes, which are defined sections of the lung.
Lobar pneumonia can be further divided into four stages based off how it�s progressed:"
pneumonia,"for pneumonia, symptoms?","Pneumonia symptoms can be mild to life threatening. They can include:
coughing that may produce phlegm (mucus)
fever
sweating or chills
shortness of breath that happens while doing normal activities, or even while resting
chest pain that�s worse when you breathe or cough
feelings of tiredness or fatigue
loss of appetite
nausea or vomiting
headaches
Other symptoms can vary according to your age and general health:
Infants may appear to have no symptoms, but sometimes they may vomit, lack energy, or have trouble drinking or eating.
Children under 5 years old may have fast breathing or wheezing.
Older adults may have milder symptoms. They can also experience confusion or a lower-than-normal body temperature."
pneumonia,"for pneumonia, causes?","Pneumonia happens when germs get into your lungs and cause an infection. The immune system�s reaction to clear the infection results in inflammation of the lung�s air sacs (alveoli). This inflammation can eventually cause the air sacs to fill up with pus and liquids, causing pneumonia symptoms.
Several types of infectious agents can cause pneumonia, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
Bacterial pneumonia
The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other causes include:
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
Haemophilus influenzae
Legionella pneumophila
Viral pneumonia
Respiratory viruses are often the cause of pneumonia. Examples of viral infections that can cause pneumonia include:
influenza (flu)
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
rhinoviruses (common cold)
human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection
human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infection
measles
chickenpox (varicella-zoster virus)
adenovirus infection
coronavirus infection
SARS-CoV-2 infection (the virus that causes COVID-19)
Although the symptoms of viral and bacterial pneumonia are very similar, viral pneumonia is usually milder. It can improve in 1 to 3 weeks without treatment.
According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
, people with viral pneumonia are at risk of developing bacterial pneumonia.
Fungal pneumonia
Fungi from soil or bird droppings can cause pneumonia. They most often cause pneumonia in people with weakened immune systems. Examples of fungi that can cause pneumonia include:
Pneumocystis jirovecii
Cryptococcus species
Histoplasmosis species
Risk factors
Anyone can get pneumonia, but certain groups do have a higher risk. These groups include:
infants from birth to 2 years old
people ages 65 and older
people with weakened immune systems due to:
pregnancy
HIV
the use of certain medications, such as steroids or certain cancer drugs
people with certain chronic medical conditions, such as:
asthma
cystic fibrosis
diabetes
COPD
heart failure
sickle cell disease
liver disease
kidney disease
people who�ve been recently or are currently hospitalized, particularly if they were or are on a ventilator
people who�ve had a brain disorder, which can affect the ability to swallow or cough, such as:
stroke
head injury
dementia
Parkinson�s disease
people who�ve been regularly exposed to lung irritants, such as air pollution and toxic fumes, especially on the job
people who live in a crowded living environment, such as a prison or nursing home
people who smoke, which makes it more difficult for the body to get rid of mucus in the airways
people who use drugs or drink heavy amounts of alcohol, which weakens the immune system and increases the odds of inhaling saliva or vomit into the lungs due to sedation"
pneumonia,"for pneumonia, diagnosis?","Your doctor will start by taking your medical history. They�ll ask you questions about when your symptoms first appeared and your health in general.
They�ll then give you a physical exam. This will include listening to your lungs with a stethoscope for any abnormal sounds, such as crackling.
Depending on the severity of your symptoms and your risk of complications, your doctor may also order one or more of these tests:
Chest X-ray
An X-ray helps your doctor look for signs of inflammation in your chest. If inflammation is present, the X-ray can also inform your doctor about its location and extent.
Blood culture
This test uses a blood sample to confirm an infection. Culturing can also help identify what may be causing your condition.
Sputum culture
During a sputum culture, a sample of mucus is collected after you�ve coughed deeply. It�s then sent to a lab to be analyzed to identify the cause of the infection.
Pulse oximetry
A pulse oximetry measures the amount of oxygen in your blood. A sensor placed on one of your fingers can indicate whether your lungs are moving enough oxygen through your bloodstream.
CT scan
CT scans provide a clearer and more detailed picture of your lungs.
Fluid sample
If your doctor suspects there�s fluid in the pleural space of your chest, they may take a fluid sample using a needle placed between your ribs. This test can help identify the cause of your infection.
Bronchoscopy
A bronchoscopy looks into the airways in your lungs. It does this using a camera on the end of a flexible tube that�s gently guided down your throat and into your lungs.
Your doctor may do this test if your initial symptoms are severe, or if you�re hospitalized and not responding well to antibiotics.
If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here."
pneumonia,"for pneumonia, treatment?","Your treatment will depend on the type of pneumonia you have, how severe it is, and your general health.
Prescription medications
Your doctor may prescribe a medication to help treat your pneumonia. What you�re prescribed will depend on the specific cause of your pneumonia.
Oral antibiotics can treat most cases of bacterial pneumonia. Always take your entire course of antibiotics, even if you begin to feel better. Not doing so can prevent the infection from clearing, and it may be harder to treat in the future.
Antibiotic medications don�t work on viruses. In some cases, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral. However, many cases of viral pneumonia clear on their own with at-home care.
Antifungal medications are used to treat fungal pneumonia. You may have to take this medication for several weeks to clear the infection.
OTC medications
Your doctor may also recommend over-the-counter (OTC) medications to relieve your pain and fever, as needed. These may include:
aspirin
ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)
acetaminophen (Tylenol)
Your doctor may also recommend cough medicine to calm your cough so you can rest. Keep in mind coughing helps remove fluid from your lungs, so you don�t want to eliminate it entirely.
Home remedies
Although home remedies don�t actually treat pneumonia, there are some things you can do to help ease symptoms.
Coughing is one of the most common symptoms of pneumonia. Natural ways to relieve a cough include gargling salt water or drinking peppermint tea.
Cool compresses can work to relieve a fever. Drinking warm water or having a nice warm bowl of soup can help with chills. Here are more home remedies to try.
You can help your recovery and prevent a recurrence by getting a lot of rest and drinking plenty of fluids.
Although home remedies can help ease symptoms, it�s important to stick to your treatment plan. Take any prescribed medications as directed.
Hospitalization
If your symptoms are very severe or you have other health problems, you may need to be hospitalized. At the hospital, doctors can keep track of your heart rate, temperature, and breathing. Hospital treatment may include:
antibiotics injected into a vein
respiratory therapy, which involves delivering specific medications directly into the lungs, or teaching you to perform breathing exercises to maximize your oxygenation
oxygen therapy to maintain oxygen levels in your bloodstream (received through a nasal tube, face mask, or ventilator, depending on severity)"
pneumonia,"for pneumonia, complications?","Pneumonia may cause complications, especially in people with weakened immune systems or chronic conditions, such as diabetes.
Complications may include:
Worsened chronic conditions. If you have certain preexisting health conditions, pneumonia could make them worse. These conditions include congestive heart failure and emphysema. For certain people, pneumonia increases their risk of having a heart attack.
Bacteremia. Bacteria from the pneumonia infection may spread to your bloodstream. This can lead to dangerously low blood pressure, septic shock, and, in some cases, organ failure.
Lung abscesses. These are cavities in the lungs that contain pus. Antibiotics can treat them. Sometimes they may require drainage or surgery to remove the pus.
Impaired breathing. You may have trouble getting enough oxygen when you breathe. You may need to use a ventilator.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome. This is a severe form of respiratory failure. It�s a medical emergency.
Pleural effusion. If your pneumonia isn�t treated, you may develop fluid around your lungs in your pleura, called pleural effusion. The pleura are thin membranes that line the outside of your lungs and the inside of your rib cage. The fluid may become infected and need to be drained.
Kidney, heart, and liver damage. These organs may be damaged if they don�t receive enough oxygen, or if there�s an overreaction of the immune system to the infection.
Death. In some cases, pneumonia can be fatal. According to the CDC, nearly 44,000 people
in the United States died from pneumonia in 2019."
pneumonia,"for pneumonia, prevention?","In many cases, pneumonia can be prevented.
Vaccination
The first line of defense against pneumonia is to get vaccinated. There are several vaccines that can help prevent pneumonia.
Prevnar 13 and Pneumovax 23
These two pneumonia vaccines help protect against pneumonia and meningitis caused by pneumococcal bacteria. Your doctor can tell you which one might be better for you.
Prevnar 13 is effective against 13 types of pneumococcal bacteria. The CDC
recommends this vaccine for:
children under age 2
people between ages 2 and 64 with chronic conditions that increase their risk of pneumonia
adults ages 65 and older, on the recommendation of their doctor
Pneumovax 23 is effective against 23 types of pneumococcal bacteria. The CDC
recommends it for:
adults ages 65 and older
adults ages 19 to 64 who smoke
people between ages 2 and 64 with chronic conditions that increase their risk of pneumonia
Flu vaccine
Pneumonia can often be a complication of the flu, so be sure to also get an annual flu shot. The CDC
recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older get vaccinated, particularly those who may be at risk of flu complications.
Hib vaccine
This vaccine protects against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), a type of bacterium that can cause pneumonia and meningitis. The CDC
recommends this vaccine for:
all children under 5 years old
unvaccinated older children or adults who have certain health conditions
people who�ve gotten a bone marrow transplant
According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
, pneumonia vaccines won�t prevent all cases of the condition.
But if you�re vaccinated, you�re likely to have a milder and shorter illness as well as a lower risk of complications.
Other prevention tips
In addition to vaccination, there are other things you can do to avoid pneumonia:
If you smoke, try to quit. Smoking makes you more susceptible to respiratory infections, especially pneumonia.
Regularly wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
Cover your coughs and sneezes. Promptly dispose used tissues.
Maintain a healthy lifestyle to strengthen your immune system. Get enough rest, eat a balanced diet, and get regular exercise.
Together with vaccination and additional prevention steps, you can help reduce your risk of getting pneumonia. Here are even more prevention tips."
pneumonia,"for pneumonia, is pneumonia curable??","A variety of infectious agents cause pneumonia. With proper recognition and treatment, many cases of pneumonia can be cleared without complications.
For bacterial infections, stopping your antibiotics early can cause the infection to not clear completely. This means your pneumonia could come back.
Stopping antibiotics early can also contribute to antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic-resistant infections are more difficult to treat.
Viral pneumonia often resolves in 1 to 3 weeks with at-home treatment. In some cases, you may need antivirals.
Antifungal medications treat fungal pneumonia. It may require a longer period of treatment."
pneumonia,"for pneumonia, pneumonia in pregnancy?","Pneumonia that occurs during pregnancy is called maternal pneumonia. Pregnant people are more at risk of developing conditions like pneumonia. This is due to the natural suppression of the immune system that happens during pregnancy.
The symptoms of pneumonia don�t differ by trimester. However, you may notice some of them more later on in your pregnancy due to other discomforts you may be encountering.
If you�re pregnant, contact your doctor as soon as you start experiencing symptoms of pneumonia. Maternal pneumonia can lead to a variety of complications, such as premature birth and low birth weight."
pneumonia,"for pneumonia, pneumonia in kids?","Pneumonia can be a rather common childhood condition. Approximately 1 in 71 children worldwide get pneumonia worldwide each year, according to the United Nations Children�s Fund (UNICEF).
The causes of childhood pneumonia can vary by age. For example, pneumonia due to respiratory viruses, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae is more common in children under 5 years old.
Pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae is frequently observed in children between the ages of 5 and 13. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the causes of walking pneumonia. It�s a milder form of pneumonia.
See your pediatrician if you notice your child:
is having trouble breathing
lacks energy
has changes in appetite
Pneumonia can become dangerous quickly, particularly in young children. Here�s how to avoid complications."
pneumonia,"for pneumonia, outlook?","Most people respond to treatment and recover from pneumonia. Like your treatment, your recovery time will depend on the type of pneumonia you have, how severe it is, and your general health.
A younger person may feel back to normal in a week after treatment. Others may take longer to recover and may have lingering fatigue. If your symptoms are severe, your recovery may take several weeks.
Consider taking these steps to aid in your recovery and help prevent complications from occurring:
Stick to the treatment plan your doctor has developed, and take all medications as instructed.
Make sure to get plenty of rest to help your body fight the infection.
Drink plenty of fluids.
Ask your doctor when you should schedule a follow-up appointment. They may want to perform another chest X-ray to make sure your infection has cleared."
pneumonia,"for pneumonia, summary?","Pneumonia is a lung infection caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The immune system�s reaction to this infection causes the lung�s air sacs to fill with pus and fluids. This leads to symptoms such as trouble breathing, a cough with or without mucus, fever, and chills.
To diagnose pneumonia, your doctor will do a physical exam and discuss your medical history. They may recommend further testing, such as a chest X-ray.
Treatment depends on the cause of the infection. It may involve antibiotics, antiviral medication, or antifungal medication.
Pneumonia often clears up in a few weeks. See a doctor right away if your symptoms get worse, as you may need to be hospitalized to prevent or treat more serious complications."

I�d like to know more about asthma. Can you help? What information do you have on asthma? Could you provide information on asthma?,"Asthma occurs because of inflammation and mucus in the lining of the airways. During an attack, this commonly causes a wheezing or whistling sound when you breathe but can cause other symptoms."
asthma,"for asthma, what is asthma??","Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways to the lungs. It makes breathing difficult and can make some physical activities challenging or even impossible.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 25 million Americans
have asthma. It�s the most common chronic condition among American children: 1 child out of every 12
has asthma.
To understand asthma, it�s necessary to understand a little about what happens when you breathe. Normally, with every breath you take, air goes through your nose or mouth, down into your throat, and into your airways, eventually making it to your lungs.
There are lots of small air passages in your lungs that help deliver oxygen from the air into your bloodstream.
Asthma symptoms occur when the lining of your airways swells and the muscles around them tighten. Mucus then fills the airways, further reducing the amount of air that can pass through.
These conditions can then bring on an asthma �attack,� which is the coughing and tightness in the chest that�s typical of asthma."
asthma,"for asthma, symptoms?","The most common symptom of asthma is wheezing. This is a squealing or whistling sound that occurs when you breathe.
Other asthma symptoms may include:
coughing, especially at night, when laughing, or during exercise
tightness in the chest
shortness of breath
difficulty talking
anxiousness or panic
fatigue
chest pain
rapid breathing
frequent infections
trouble sleeping
The type of asthma that you have can determine which symptoms you experience.
Some people experience symptoms consistently throughout the day. Others may find that certain activities can make symptoms worse.
Not everyone with asthma will experience these particular symptoms. If you think the symptoms you�re experiencing could be a sign of a condition such as asthma, make an appointment to see your doctor.
Also, keep in mind that even if your asthma is well-managed, you may still occasionally experience a flare-up of symptoms. Flare-ups often improve with the use of quick-acting treatments, like an inhaler, but may require medical attention in severe cases.
Signs of an asthma flare-up may include:
coughing
wheezing
throat clearing
difficulty sleeping
chest pain or tightness
fatigue
If your symptoms worsen or don�t improve with the use of an inhaler, you should seek immediate medical treatment.
You should also seek treatment if you experience symptoms of an asthma emergency, including:
severe breathing difficulty
gasping for air
confusion
pale lips or fingernails
dizziness
difficulty walking or talking
blue lips or fingernails
Call 911
If you or someone around you experiences symptoms of an asthma emergency, call 911 or your local emergency number, or go to the nearest emergency department.

asthma,"for asthma, causes and triggers?","Although asthma is especially common in children, many people don�t develop asthma until they are adults.
No single cause has been identified
for asthma. Instead, researchers believe it�s caused by a variety of factors. These factors include:
Genetics. If a parent or sibling has asthma, you�re more likely to develop it.
History of viral infections. People with a history of severe viral infections during childhood, such as respiratory syncytial virus infection (RSV), may be more likely to develop the condition.
Hygiene hypothesis. This theory explains that when babies aren�t exposed to enough bacteria in their early months and years, their immune systems don�t become strong enough to fight off asthma and other allergic conditions.
Many factors can also trigger asthma and cause symptoms to worsen. Triggers for asthma can vary and some people may be more sensitive to certain triggers than others.
The most common triggers include:
health conditions, such as respiratory infections
exercise
environmental irritants
allergens
intense emotions
extreme weather conditions
pests
certain medications, including aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)"
asthma,"for asthma, diagnosis and types?","There�s no single test or exam that will determine if you or your child has asthma. Instead, your doctor will use a variety of criteria to determine if the symptoms are the result of asthma.
The following can help diagnose
asthma:
Health history. If you have family members with the breathing disorder, your risk is higher. Alert your doctor to this genetic connection.
Physical exam. Your doctor will listen to your breathing with a stethoscope. You may also be given a skin test to look for signs of an allergic reaction, such as hives or eczema. Allergies increase your risk for asthma.
Breathing tests. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) measure airflow into and out of your lungs. For the most common test, spirometry, you blow into a device that measures the speed of the air.
Doctors don�t typically perform breathing tests in children under 5 years of age because it�s difficult to get an accurate reading.
Instead, they may prescribe asthma medications to your child and wait to see if symptoms improve. If they do, your child likely has asthma.
For adults, your doctor may prescribe a bronchodilator or other asthma medication if test results indicate asthma. If symptoms improve with the use of this medication, your doctor will continue to treat your condition as asthma.
Your doctor will also need to determine the type of asthma you have. The most common type is allergic asthma, representing 60 percent
of all cases of asthma.
Additional types of asthma are related to a person�s stage in life. Though asthma can appear at any age, pediatric asthma specifically affects children and adult-onset asthma doesn�t appear until adulthood.
Other specific types of asthma are described below.
Allergic asthma
Allergens trigger this common type of asthma. These might include:
pet dander from animals like cats and dogs
food
mold
pollen
dust
Allergic asthma is often seasonal because it goes hand-in-hand with seasonal allergies.
Non-allergic asthma
Irritants in the air not related to allergies trigger this type of asthma. These irritants might include:
burning wood
cigarette smoke
cold air
air pollution
viral illnesses
air fresheners
household cleaning products
perfumes
Occupational asthma
Occupational asthma is a type of asthma induced by triggers in the workplace. These include:
dust
dyes
gases and fumes
industrial chemicals
animal proteins
rubber latex
These irritants can exist in a wide range of industries, including:
farming
textiles
woodworking
manufacturing
Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB)
Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) usually affects people within a few minutes of starting exercise and up to 10 to 15 minutes after physical activity.
This condition was previously known as exercise-induced asthma (EIA).
Up to 90 percent of people with asthma also experience EIB, but not everyone with EIB will have other types of asthma.
Aspirin-induced asthma
Aspirin-induced asthma (AIA), also called aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), is usually severe.
It�s triggered by taking aspirin or another NSAID, such as naproxen (Aleve) or ibuprofen (Advil).
The symptoms may begin within minutes or hours. People with AIA also typically have nasal polyps.
About 9 percent of people with asthma have AIA. It usually develops suddenly in adults between the ages of 20 and 50.
Nocturnal asthma
In this type of asthma, symptoms worsen at night.
Triggers that are thought to bring on symptoms at night include:
heartburn
pet dander
dust mites
The body�s natural sleep cycle may also trigger nocturnal asthma.
Cough-variant asthma (CVA)
Cough-variant asthma (CVA) doesn�t have classic asthma symptoms of wheezing and shortness of breath. It�s characterized by a persistent, dry cough.
If it�s not treated, CVA can lead to full-blown asthma flares that include the other more common symptoms."
asthma,"for asthma, treatment?","To help treat asthma, the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP)
classifies the condition based on its severity before treatment.
Asthma classifications include:
Intermittent. Most people have this type of asthma, which doesn�t interfere with daily activities. Symptoms are mild, lasting fewer than 2 days per week or 2 nights per month.
Mild persistent. The symptoms occur more than twice a week � but not daily � and up to 4 nights per month.
Moderate persistent. The symptoms occur daily and at least 1 night every week, but not nightly. They may limit some daily activities.
Severe persistent. The symptoms occur several times every day and most nights. Daily activities are extremely limited.
Treatments for asthma fall into four primary categories:
quick relief medications
long-term control medications
a combination of quick relief and long-term control medications. The most current asthma clinical guidelines
, released in 2020 by the NAEPP, recommend this treatment. However this treatment is not yet approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA).
biologics, which are given by injection or infusion usually only for severe forms of asthma
Your doctor will recommend one treatment or a combination of treatments based on:
the type of asthma you have
your age
your triggers
Your treatment plan may also involve learning your triggers, monitoring your symptoms carefully, and taking steps to avoid flare-ups.
Quick-relief asthma treatments
These medications should only be used in the event of asthma symptoms or an attack. They provide quick relief to help you breathe again.
Bronchodilators
Bronchodilators work within minutes to relax the tightened muscles around your airwaves and decrease symptoms quickly.
Although they can be administered orally or injected, bronchodilators are most commonly taken with an inhaler (rescue) or nebulizer.
They can be used to treat sudden symptoms of asthma or taken before exercise to prevent a flare-up.
First aid asthma treatment
If you think that someone you know is having an asthma attack, tell them to sit them upright and assist them in using their rescue inhaler or nebulizer.
The dosage will vary depending on the medication. Check the instructions insert to make sure you know how many puffs of medications you need in the event of an attack.
If symptoms persist for more than 20 minutes, and a second round of medication doesn�t help, seek emergency medical attention.
If you frequently need to use quick-relief medications, ask your doctor about another type of medication for long-term asthma control.
Long-term asthma control medications
These medications are taken daily to help reduce the number and severity of your asthma symptoms, but they don�t manage the immediate symptoms of an attack.
Long-term asthma control medications include:
Anti-inflammatories. Taken with an inhaler, corticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory medications help reduce swelling and mucus production in your airways, making it easier to breathe.
Anticholinergics. These help stop your muscles from tightening around your airways. They�re usually taken daily in combination with anti-inflammatories.
Long-acting bronchodilators. These should only be used in combination with anti-inflammatory asthma medications.
Biologics
Doctors use biologics to treat severe asthma that doesn�t respond to other medications or to treatment by trigger control.
They work by targeting specific antibodies in your body. This disrupts the pathway that leads to asthma-causing inflammation.
There are five types of biologic medications on the market, and others in development. These medications need to be administered either by injection or by infusion in your doctor�s office.
Bronchial thermoplasty
This treatment uses an electrode to heat
the airways inside the lungs, helping to reduce the size of the surrounding muscle and prevent it from tightening.
This minimally invasive procedure is performed by a doctor in a clinic or hospital and usually takes around an hour.
Bronchial thermoplasty is intended for people with severe asthma and can provide relief from symptoms for up to 5 years
.
However, because it�s a relatively new procedure, it�s not yet widely available."
asthma,"for asthma, what is an asthma attack??","When your asthma symptoms get progressively worse, it�s known as an exacerbation, or an asthma attack.
It becomes increasingly difficult to breathe because the airways are swollen and the bronchial tubes have narrowed.
The symptoms of an exacerbation may include
:
hyperventilation
cough
wheezing
shortness of breath
increased heart rate
agitation
confusion
blue lips
Although an exacerbation can end quickly without medication, you should contact your doctor because it can be life threatening.
The longer an exacerbation continues, the more it can affect your ability to breathe. That�s why exacerbations often require a trip to the emergency room.
Exacerbations can be prevented by taking medications that help manage your asthma symptoms."
asthma,"for asthma, prevention and management?","Because researchers have yet to identify the exact cause of asthma, it�s challenging to know how to prevent the inflammatory condition.
However, more information is known about preventing asthma attacks. These strategies include:
Avoiding triggers. Steer clear of chemicals, smells, or products that have caused breathing problems in the past.
Reducing exposure to allergens. If you�ve identified allergens, such as dust or mold, that trigger an asthma attack, avoid them if possible.
Getting allergy shots. Allergen immunotherapy is a type of treatment that may help alter your immune system. With routine shots, your body may become less sensitive to any triggers you encounter.
Taking preventive medication. Your doctor may prescribe medication for you to take on a daily basis. This medication may be used in addition to the one you use in case of an emergency.
Your doctor can help you put an asthma action plan in place so that you know which treatments to use and when.
In addition to using maintenance medications, you can take steps each day to help make yourself healthier and reduce your risk for asthma attacks. These include:
Eating a healthier diet. Eating a healthy, balanced diet can help improve your overall health.
Maintaining a moderate weight. Asthma tends to be worse in people with overweight and obesity. Losing weight is healthy for your heart, your joints, and your lungs.
Quitting smoking, if you smoke. Irritants such as cigarette smoke can trigger asthma and increase your risk for COPD.
Exercising regularly. Activity can trigger an asthma attack, but regular exercise may actually help reduce the risk of breathing problems.
Managing stress. Stress can be a trigger for asthma symptoms. Stress can also make stopping an asthma attack more difficult.
Nutrient-rich foods are vital to helping reduce symptoms, but food allergies can trigger asthma symptoms."
asthma,"for asthma, when to see a doctor?","At the moment, there�s no cure for asthma. However, there are many effective treatments that can decrease asthma symptoms. Lifestyle changes and medications can also help improve your quality of life.
If you haven�t been diagnosed with asthma but are experiencing symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, or shortness of breath, you should let your doctor know. You can connect to a physician in your area using the Healthline FindCare tool.
Once you�re diagnosed with asthma, you should see your doctor at least once a year or more frequently if you have persistent symptoms after using treatments.
Call your doctor immediately if you:
feel weak
can�t perform daily activities
have a wheeze or cough that won�t go away
It�s important to educate yourself about your condition and its symptoms. The more you know, the more proactive you can be in improving your lung function and how you feel.
Talk with your doctor about:
your type of asthma
what triggers your symptoms
what daily treatments are best for you
your treatment plan for an asthma attack"
asthma,"for asthma, takeaway?","Asthma is a condition that inflames the lungs and makes it difficult to breathe. It can affect both adults and children in different forms and in different levels of severity.
There are different medications available to treat asthma. The most common treatments are bronchodilators, which can be short-term to treat an asthma attack or long-term for management of symptoms over time.
Lifestyle changes may also help reduce asthma flare-ups. This can include dietary changes, exercise, or stress management. Speak with your doctor to identify the type of asthma you may have and the best treatment and management options for you.

myocardial infarction,what is myocardial infarction? Tell me about myocardial infarction? What kind of disease is myocardial infarction? Can you elaborate on myocardial infarction? What can you tell me about myocardial infarction? Could you describe what myocardial infarction is? I�d like to know more about myocardial infarction. Can you help? What information do you have on myocardial infarction? Could you provide information on myocardial infarction?,"Acute myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack, is a life-threatening condition that occurs when blood flow to the heart muscle is abruptly cut off, causing tissue damage.
This is usually the result of a blockage in one or more of the coronary arteries. A blockage can develop due to a buildup of plaque, a substance mostly made of fat, cholesterol, and cellular waste products or due to a sudden blood clot that forms on the blockage.
Call 911 or local emergency services right away if you think that you or someone you know may be having a heart attack."
myocardial infarction,"for myocardial infarction, what are the symptoms of acute myocardial infarction??","In an emergency
If you, or someone around you, experiences symptoms of a heart attack, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department.
Was this helpful?
While the classic symptoms of a heart attack are chest pain and shortness of breath, the symptoms can be quite varied. The most common symptoms of a heart attack include
:
pressure or tightness in the chest
pain in the chest, back, jaw, and other areas of the upper body that lasts more than a few minutes or that goes away and comes back
shortness of breath
sweating
nausea
vomiting
anxiety
feeling like you�re going to faint
a fast heart rate
sense of impending doom
It�s important to note that not all people who have heart attacks experience the same symptoms or the same severity of symptoms.
Chest pain is the most commonly reported symptom among both women and men. However, women are a bit more likely
than men to have more of the �atypical� symptoms, such as:
shortness of breath
jaw pain
upper back pain
lightheadedness
nausea
vomiting
In fact, some women who have had a heart attack report that their symptoms felt like the symptoms of the flu."
myocardial infarction,"for myocardial infarction, what causes acute myocardial infarction??","Your heart is the main organ in your cardiovascular system, which also includes different types of blood vessels. Some of the most important vessels are the arteries. They take oxygen-rich blood to your body and all of your organs.
The coronary arteries take oxygen-rich blood specifically to your heart muscle. When these arteries become blocked or narrowed due to a buildup of plaque, the blood flow to your heart can decrease significantly or stop completely. This can cause a heart attack."
myocardial infarction,"for myocardial infarction, who is at risk for acute myocardial infarction??","A major trigger for heart problems can be
the fat content of food. People who eat a lot of processed and fried foods, as well as some meat and dairy foods that contain unhealthy saturated and trans saturated fats, are at a higher risk for heart disease. Obesity can increase this risk.
According to one study, replacing 2 percent
of calories consumed from carbs with trans fat could double the risk of heart disease.
In addition, your blood also contains fat known as triglycerides, which store
excess energy from the food that you eat. When the level of triglycerides in your blood is high, you may be more at risk for cardiovascular disease.
If, along with that, you also have a high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in your blood, your risk may be even higher. This is because LDL cholesterol can stick to the walls of your arteries and produce plaque, a hard substance that blocks
blood flow in the arteries.
Reducing your cholesterol and the unhealthy fat in your body typically requires eating a balanced diet that contains few processed foods, and when necessary, taking medications called statins.
Your doctor would be able to recommend the best nutrition plan for you and determine whether you need to take medications.
Additional risks
In addition to your diet, the following factors can also increase your risk of heart problems
:
High blood pressure. This can damage your arteries and accelerate the buildup of plaque.
High blood sugar levels. Having high levels of blood sugar can damage blood vessels and eventually lead to coronary artery disease.
Smoking. Smoking may increase your risk for heart attack and lead to other cardiovascular conditions and diseases.
Age. The risk of having a heart attack increases with age. Men are at a higher risk of a heart attack after age 45, and women are at a higher risk of a heart attack after age 55.
Sex. Not only do men have a significantly higher risk of having a heart attack than women, but they also often have heart attacks earlier in life.
Family history. You�re more likely to have a heart attack if you have a family history of early heart disease. Your risk is especially high if you have male family members who developed heart disease before age 55 or if you have female family members who developed heart disease before age 65.
Stress. Although the evidence for this is still limited, stress may also
be a trigger for acute myocardial infarction. Reducing chronic anxiety or stress can help reduce the risk of a heart attack and other heart problems over time.
Physical inactivity. Getting regular exercise can help keep your heart healthy by helping you maintain a moderate weight, as well as reduce your blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels.
Drug use. The use of certain drugs, including cocaine and amphetamines, can narrow the blood vessels, which could increase the risk of heart attack.
Preeclampsia. If you have a history of preeclampsia, or high blood pressure during pregnancy, you may be at a higher risk of developing heart problems later in life."
myocardial infarction,"for myocardial infarction, how is acute myocardial infarction diagnosed??","To determine whether you�ve had a heart attack, your doctor will look over the history of your symptoms, as well as your vital signs such as your blood pressure. Your doctor will then complete a physical exam with specific attention to the heart.
Your doctor will also run a number of different tests if they suspect that you�ve had a heart attack. An electrocardiogram (EKG) may be done to measure your heart�s electrical activity.
Blood tests will also be used to check for proteins that are associated with heart damage, such as troponin.
Your doctor may also perform an angiogram with coronary catheterization to look for areas of blockage in your arteries."
myocardial infarction,"for myocardial infarction, how is acute myocardial infarction treated??","Heart attacks require immediate treatment, so most treatments begin in the emergency room. Treatment may include taking medications to resolve blood clots, reduce pain, or slow down your heart rate.
The doctor may also send you to undergo a minimally invasive procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), formerly referred to as an angioplasty with a stent. This procedure is used to unblock
the arteries that supply blood to the heart.
Only about 36 percent
of hospitals in the United States are equipped to perform this procedure. If your hospital is unable to perform an angioplasty, they may transfer you to another hospital that can.
During the procedure, your surgeon will insert a long, thin tube called a catheter through your artery to reach the blockage. They will then inflate a small balloon attached to the catheter in order to reopen the artery, allowing blood flow to resume.
Your surgeon may also place a small, mesh tube called a stent at the site of the blockage. The stent can prevent the artery from closing again.
Your doctor may also want to perform a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). In this procedure, your surgeon will restore blood flow by rerouting your veins and arteries so the blood can move around the blockage.
A CABG is sometimes done immediately after a heart attack. In most cases, however, it�s performed several days after the incident so your heart has time to heal.
Another procedure your doctor may want you to undergo is a bypass surgery, which is used
to form new passages for blood to flow to the heart.
A number of different medications can also be used to treat a heart attack:
Blood thinners, such as aspirin, are often used to break up blood clots and improve blood flow through narrowed arteries.
Thrombolytics are often used to dissolve clots.
Antiplatelet drugs, such as clopidogrel, can be used to prevent new clots from forming and existing clots from growing.
Nitroglycerin can be used to widen your blood vessels.
Beta-blockers lower your blood pressure and relax your heart muscle. This can help limit the severity of damage to your heart.
ACE inhibitors can also be used to lower blood pressure and decrease stress on the heart.
Pain relievers may be used to reduce any discomfort you may feel.
Diuretics can help decrease fluid buildup to ease the workload of the heart."
myocardial infarction,"for myocardial infarction, management after heart attack?","Your chances of recovering from a heart attack depend on how much damage there is to your heart and how quickly you receive emergency care. The sooner you receive treatment, the more likely you are to survive.
Keep in mind that recovery is a long process and may take several weeks or months after leaving the hospital. After having a heart attack, you may also be at a higher risk of having other heart problems in the future.
For example, if there�s substantial damage to your heart muscle, your heart may be unable to pump an adequate amount of blood throughout your body. This can lead to heart failure. Heart damage also increases your risk of valve problems and developing an abnormal heart rhythm or arrhythmia.
Your risk of having another heart attack will be higher as well. In fact, it�s estimated that one in five
people who have had a heart attack will be readmitted to the hospital for a second heart attack within five years.
Many people also experience
chest pain after having a heart attack, especially after eating a large meal or engaging in physical activity. Be sure to talk to your doctor if you notice any chest pain. They can recommend certain medications or exercises to help relieve symptoms.
As part of your treatment plan, you may be required
to take medications or undergo a cardiac rehabilitation program. This type of program can help you slowly regain your strength, teach you about healthy lifestyle changes, and guide you through treatment.
Follow-up
There are several ways to prevent another heart attack and promote healing, including working with your doctor to make changes to your diet and lifestyle.
It�s also important to speak with your doctor about your concerns during recovery. Because many people who�ve had heart attacks often experience anxiety and depression, it may be beneficial to join a support group
or to speak with a counselor about what you�re going through.
Most people are able to resume their normal activities after a heart attack. However, you�ll need to ease back into any intense physical activity. Your doctor will help you develop a specific plan for recovery."
myocardial infarction,"for myocardial infarction, how can acute myocardial infarction be prevented??","There are many steps you can take to prevent a heart attack, even if you�ve had one before.
One way to lower your risk is to eat a heart-healthy diet.
This diet should largely consist of:
whole grains
vegetables
fruits
lean protein
You should also try to reduce the following in your diet:
sugar
processed foods
This is especially important for people with diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol.
Exercising several times a week will also improve your cardiovascular health. If you�ve had a heart attack recently, you should speak with your doctor before starting a new exercise plan.
It�s also important to stop smoking if you smoke. Quitting smoking will significantly lower your risk of a heart attack and improve both your heart and lung health. You should also avoid being around secondhand smoke."
myocardial infarction,"for myocardial infarction, takeaway?","Acute myocardial infarction, or heart attack, is a serious condition that occurs when blood flow to the heart is cut off, which requires immediate medical treatment.
Fortunately, there are many ways to prevent complications associated with this condition and minimize the long-term effects on health.
Not only can making changes to your diet and lifestyle promote recovery after a heart attack, but it can also prevent heart attacks from occurring again in the future."
dementia,what is dementia? Tell me about dementia? What kind of disease is dementia? Can you elaborate on dementia? What can you tell me about dementia? Could you describe what dementia is? I�d like to know more about dementia. Can you help? What information do you have on dementia? Could you provide information on dementia?,"Dementia is a neurodegenerative disease that has several different forms, symptoms, and causes. There�s currently no cure, but researchers are looking into effective treatments and ways to prevent it.
Dementia is a decline in cognitive function. To be considered dementia, mental impairment must affect at least two brain functions. Dementia may affect:
Dementia may be caused by a variety of illnesses or injuries. Mental impairment may range from mild to severe. It may also cause personality changes.
Some types of dementia are progressive. This means they get worse over time. Some types are treatable or even reversible. Some experts restrict the term �dementia� to irreversible mental deterioration."
dementia,"for dementia, dementia signs and symptoms?","In its early stages, dementia can cause symptoms, such as:
Not coping well with change. Someone may have a hard time accepting changes in schedules or environment.
Subtle changes in short-term memory making. Someone can remember the events of 15 years ago like it was yesterday, but they can�t remember what they had for lunch.
Reaching for the right words. Word recollection or association may be more difficult.
Being repetitive. Someone may ask the same question, complete the same task, or tell the same story multiple times.
Confused sense of direction. Places someone once knew well may now feel foreign. They may also struggle with driving routes they�ve taken for years because it no longer looks familiar.
Struggling to follow storylines. Someone may find following a person�s story or description difficult.
Changes in mood. Depression, frustration, and anger are not uncommon for people with dementia.
Loss of interest. Apathy may occur in people with dementia. This includes losing interest in hobbies or activities that they once enjoyed.
Confusion. People, places, and events may no longer feel familiar. Someone might not remember people who know them.
Difficulty completing everyday tasks. A person in the early stages of dementia may have trouble recalling how to do tasks they�ve done for many years."
dementia,"for dementia, what causes dementia??","Dementia has many causes. In general, it results from the degeneration of neurons (brain cells) or disturbances in other body systems that affect how neurons function.
Several conditions can cause dementia, including diseases of the brain. The most common causes are Alzheimer�s disease and vascular dementia.
Some of the more common causes of dementia include:
Neurodegenerative diseases
�Neurodegenerative� means that neurons gradually stop functioning or function inappropriately and eventually die.
This affects the neuron-to-neuron connections, called synapses, which arehow messages are passed along in your brain. This disconnect can result in a range of dysfunction.
Alzheimer�s disease
Parkinson�s disease with dementia
vascular dementia
chronic alcohol use disorder
Another cause is frontotemporal lobar degeneration. This is a blanket term for a range of conditions that cause damage to the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. They include:
frontotemporal dementia
Pick�s disease
supranuclear palsy
corticobasal degeneration
Other causes of dementia
Dementia has other causes, including:
structural brain disorders, such as normal pressure hydrocephalus and subdural hematoma
metabolic disorders, such as hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 deficiency, and kidney and liver disorders
toxins, such as lead
certain tumors or infections of the brain
medication side effects
Some of these types of dementia may be reversible. These treatable causes of dementia may reverse symptoms if they�re caught early enough. This is one of the many reasons why it�s important to contact your doctor and get a medical workup as soon as symptoms develop."
dementia,"for dementia, types of dementia?","Most cases of dementia are a symptom of a specific disease. Different diseases cause different types of dementia. The most common types of dementia include:
Alzheimer�s disease. The most common type of dementia, Alzheimer�s disease makes up 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases, according to the Alzheimer�s Association.
Vascular dementia. This type of dementia is caused by reduced blood flow in the brain. It may be the result of plaque buildup in arteries that feed blood to the brain or a stroke.
Lewy body dementia. With Lewy body dementia, protein deposits in nerve cells prevent the brain from sending chemical signals. This results in lost messages, delayed reactions, and memory loss.
Parkinson�s disease. Individuals with advanced Parkinson�s disease may develop dementia. Symptoms of this particular type of dementia include problems with reasoning and judgment, as well as increased irritability, paranoia, and depression.
Frontotemporal dementia. Several types of dementia fall into this category. They�re each affected by changes in the front and side parts of the brain. Symptoms include difficulty with language and behavior, as well as loss of inhibitions.
Other types of dementia exist. However, they�re less common. In fact, one type of dementia, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, occurs in only 1 in 1 million people."
dementia,"for dementia, stages of dementia?","In most cases, dementia is progressive, getting worse over time. That said, dementia progresses differently in everyone. However, most people experience symptoms of the following stages of dementia.
Mild cognitive impairment
Older adults may develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI) but may never progress to dementia or any other mental impairment. People with MCI commonly experience forgetfulness, trouble recalling words, and short-term memory problems.
Mild dementia
At this stage, people with mild dementia may be able to function independently. Symptoms include:
short-term memory lapses
personality changes, including anger or depression
misplacing things or forgetfulness
difficulty with complex tasks or problem solving
difficulty expressing emotions or ideas
Moderate dementia
At this stage of dementia, people affected may need assistance from a loved one or care professional. That�s because dementia may now interfere with daily tasks and activities. Symptoms include:
poor judgment
increasing confusion and frustration
memory loss that reaches further into the past
needing help with tasks like dressing and bathing
significant personality changes
Severe dementia
At this late stage of dementia, the mental and physical symptoms of the condition continue to worsen. Symptoms include:
inability to maintain bodily functions, including walking and eventually swallowing and controlling the bladder
inability to communicate
requiring full-time assistance
increased risk of infections
People with dementia will progress through the stages of dementia at different rates."
dementia,"for dementia, dementia testing?","No single test can confirm a dementia diagnosis. Instead, a doctor will use a series of tests and exams. These include:
a thorough medical history
a careful physical exam
laboratory tests, including blood tests
a review of symptoms, including changes in memory, behavior, and brain function
a family history
Doctors can determine if you or a loved one is experiencing symptoms of dementia with a high degree of certainty. However, they may not be able to determine the exact type of dementia. In many cases, symptoms of dementia types overlap. That makes distinguishing between types difficult.
Some doctors will diagnose dementia without specifying the type. In that case, you may wish to visit a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating dementia. These doctors are called neurologists. Some geriatricians also specialize in this type of diagnosis."
dementia,"for dementia, dementia treatment?","Two primary treatments are used to alleviate symptoms of dementia: medications and non-drug therapies. Not all medications are approved for each type of dementia, and no treatment is a cure.
Medications for dementia
Two main types of medication are used to treat symptoms of Alzheimer�s disease and other dementia-causing conditions:
Cholinesterase inhibitors. These drugs increase a chemical called acetylcholine. This chemical may help form memories and improve judgment. It may also delay worsening symptoms of Alzheimer�s disease.
Memantine. This drug is used to delay the onset of cognitive and behavioral symptoms in people with moderate or severe Alzheimer�s disease. Memantine may let people with Alzheimer�s disease maintain their usual mental functions for a longer period of time.
These two drugs may also be prescribed together. Side effects can occur. Other medications may be prescribed to treat related symptoms, such as impaired sleep, mood changes, and more.
Aducanumab (Aduhelm)
Aducanumab is another medication approved to treat Alzheimer�s and may slow the progression of the disease, though research is ongoing. Aducanumab is an anti-amyloid antibody therapy delivered intravenously. It targets a specific protein fragment that can disrupt communication between nerve cells in the brain.
Non-drug therapies
These therapies may help reduce symptoms of dementia and alleviate some of the manageable complications of the condition. Common non-drug treatments for dementia include:
Modifying your environment. Clutter, noise, and overstimulation may reduce focus.
Modifying common tasks. You can work with a therapist or other healthcare professional to break down everyday activities, such as showering or grooming, into manageable tasks.
Occupational therapy. Occupational therapists are specialized healthcare professionals who can help you learn to be safer and more secure with tasks including walking, cooking, and driving."
dementia,"for dementia, dementia prevention?","For decades, doctors and researchers believed dementia could not be prevented or cured. However, new research suggests that may not be the case.
A 2017 review found that more than one-third of dementia cases may be the result of lifestyle factors. Specifically, the researchers identified nine risk factors that may increase a person�s chance of developing dementia. They include:
midlife hypertension
midlife obesity
hearing loss
late-life depression
diabetes
physical inactivity
smoking
social isolation
lower levels of education
The researchers believe that targeting these risk factors with treatment or intervention could delay or possibly prevent some cases of dementia.
A 2019 retrospective study
looked at nearly 200,000 participants of European ancestry. The study suggested that lifestyle factors such as smoking status, physical activity, diet, and alcohol consumption could potentially contribute to the risk of dementia.
These findings suggest that working with your doctor to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle could help prevent or delay the onset of dementia."
dementia,"for dementia, dementia life expectancy?","Individuals living with dementia can and do live for years after their diagnosis. It may seem that dementia is not a fatal disease because of this. However, late-stage dementia is considered terminal.
It�s difficult for doctors to predict life expectancies in people with dementia. Likewise, factors that influence life expectancy may have a different impact on the length of life in each person.
In one 2015 study
, women diagnosed with Alzheimer�s disease lived an average of 5.7 years after diagnosis. Men lived 4.2 years. Life expectancies, the study found, may be shorter for individuals with other types of dementia.
Certain risk factors increase the likelihood of death in people with dementia. These factors include:
increased age
being born male
decreased capabilities and functionality
additional medical conditions, diseases, or diagnoses, such as diabetes or cancer
However, it�s important to remember that dementia doesn�t follow a specific timeline. You or your loved one may progress through the stages of dementia slowly, or the progression may be rapid and unpredictable. This will affect life expectancy."
dementia,"for dementia, dementia vs. alzheimer�s disease?","Dementia and Alzheimer�s disease are not the same. Dementia is an umbrella term used to describe a collection of symptoms related to memory, language, and decision making.
Alzheimer�s disease is the most common type of dementia. It causes difficulty with things like:
short-term memory
depression
disorientation
behavioral changes
Dementia causes symptoms such as:
forgetfulness or memory impairment
loss of sense of direction
confusion
difficulty with personal care
The exact constellation of symptoms will depend on the type of dementia you have.
Alzheimer�s disease can also cause these symptoms, but other symptoms of Alzheimer�s may include depression, impaired judgment, and difficulty speaking.
Likewise, treatments for dementia depend on the type you have. However, Alzheimer�s disease treatments often overlap with other nonpharmacological dementia treatments.
In the case of some types of dementia, treating the underlying cause may be helpful in reducing or stopping the memory and behavior problems. However, that is not the case with Alzheimer�s disease.
Comparing the two may help you tell the difference between symptoms you or a loved one may be experiencing."
dementia,"for dementia, dementia from alcohol?","Alcohol use may be the most preventable risk factor for dementia. A 2018 study
found that the majority of early onset dementia cases were related to alcohol use.
The study found that nearly one-third
of early onset dementia cases were directly linked to alcohol. Plus, 18 percent of people in the study had been diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder.
Alcohol use disorders, the researchers discovered, increase a person�s risk of dementia threefold
.
Not all drinking is dangerous to your memories and mental health. Moderate levels of drinking may even be beneficial to your heart�s health. This includes no more than one glass per day for women and two glasses per day for men."
dementia,"for dementia, isn�t forgetfulness a normal part of aging??","It�s absolutely natural to forget things once in a while. Memory loss by itself does not mean you have dementia. There is a difference between occasional forgetfulness and forgetfulness that is cause for serious concern.
Potential red flags for dementia include:
forgetting who someone is
forgetting how to do common tasks, such as how to use the telephone or find your way home
inability to comprehend or retain information that has been clearly provided
Get medical attention if you experience any of the above.
Getting lost in familiar settings is often one of the first signs of dementia. For example, you might have trouble driving to the supermarket."
dementia,"for dementia, how common is dementia??","According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 55 million people
have dementia worldwide, with around 10 million new cases reported each year.
The number of people receiving dementia diagnoses or living with dementia is increasing. This increase is due partly to increasing life expectancy.
By 2030, the size of the population 65 years of age and older in the United States is expected to almost double from 37 million people in 2006 to an estimated 74 million by 2030, according to the Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics.
The rates of dementia will likely increase with this larger population of people older than 65."
dementia,"for dementia, what research is being done??","Scientists all over the world are working to gain a better understanding of the many different aspects of dementia. This might help to develop preventive measures, improved early detection diagnostic tools, better and longer-lasting treatments, and even cures.
For example, 2018 research on mice suggests a common asthma drug called zileuton might slow, stop, and potentially reverse the development of proteins in the brain. These proteins are common in people with Alzheimer�s disease.
Another 2021 review suggests deep brain stimulation could be an effective way to limit symptoms of Alzheimer�s in older adults. This method has been used to treat symptoms of Parkinson�s disease, such as tremors, for decades.
Even simple blood tests have now been developed that can detect Alzheimer�s, according to a 2021 study
. As well, researchers are looking at the possibility of slowing the progression of Alzheimer�s.
Scientists are investigating a variety of factors they think might influence the development of dementia, including:
genetic factors
various neurotransmitters
inflammation
factors that influence programmed cell death in the brain
tau, a protein found in neurons of the central nervous system
oxidative stress, or chemical reactions that can damage proteins, DNA, and lipids inside cells
This research can help doctors and scientists better understand what causes dementia, and then discover how best to treat and possibly prevent the disorder.
According to a 2019 study
, there is also increasing evidence that lifestyle factors may be effective in decreasing the risk of developing dementia. Such factors might include getting regular exercise and maintaining social connections."
dementia,"for dementia, outlook?","Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that Alzheimer�s disease is the seventh most common
cause of death in the United States. That said, people with dementia will progress through the illness at varying speeds and experience different symptoms.
There is currently no cure for dementia, but plenty of research is still being done. Hopefully, one day, outlooks will improve.
If you�re experiencing memory issues or any other symptoms that point to dementia, talk with your doctor as soon as possible. Early diagnosis can help people with dementia and their families plan for the future."

Medications and certain lifestyle changes may help ease symptoms.
Certain brands and strengths of medication for hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid)

"
hypothyroidism,"for hypothyroidism, what is hypothyroidism??","Hypothyroidism occurs when your body doesn�t produce enough thyroid hormones. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland that sits in front of your windpipe. It releases hormones that help your body regulate and use energy.
Thyroid hormones help control functions including how your heart beats and how your digestive system works. Without the right amount of thyroid hormones, your body�s natural functions begin to slow down.
Also called underactive thyroid, hypothyroidism usually affects people over the age of 60 and is more common in women than men. It may be discovered through a routine blood test or after symptoms begin.
Subclinical hypothyroidism is the name given to an early, mild form of the condition.
If you�ve recently received a hypothyroidism diagnosis, it�s important to know that treatment is considered simple, safe, and effective.
Most treatments rely on supplementing your low hormone levels with artificial hormones. These hormones will replace what your body isn�t producing on its own and help return your body�s functions to normal.
Hypothyroidism vs. hyperthyroidism
Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism have opposite effects. With hyperthyroidism, or overactive thyroid, the thyroid gland makes too much thyroid hormone.
The greater amount of thyroid hormone causes some functions in your body to become faster, like your heart rate. You may also experience weight loss and difficulty sleeping.
Hyperthyroidism is less common than hypothyroidism. It affects around 1 percent
of people ages 12 and older in the United States. Like hypothyroidism, it occurs more frequently in women and people over age 60.
Medications, radioiodine therapy, and surgery may be used to treat hyperthyroidism."
hypothyroidism,"for hypothyroidism, how common is hypothyroidism??","Hypothyroidism is a fairly common condition. In the United States, almost 5 percent
of people ages 12 years old and up have hypothyroidism.
The disease gets more common with age. People over 60 years old experience it more frequently.
Women are more likely to have an underactive thyroid. In fact, 1 in 8 women will develop thyroid issues."
hypothyroidism,"for hypothyroidism, what are the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism??","The effects of hypothyroidism on the body often vary among different people and may be difficult to identify. The severity of the condition also affects which signs and symptoms appear and when.
Early symptoms can include weight gain and fatigue. Note that these both become more common as you age, regardless of your thyroid�s health.
As a result, you may not realize that these changes are related to your thyroid until more symptoms appear. For instance, these may include skin changes associated with hypothyroidism, like scaly, rough, and dry skin and fragile nails.
In general, the most common signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism include:
fatigue
weight gain
depression
constipation
feeling cold
decreased sweating
slowed heart rate
elevated blood cholesterol
dry skin
dry, thinning hair
impaired memory
muscle weakness
muscle stiffness, aches, and tenderness
pain and stiffness in your joints
For most people, symptoms of the condition progress gradually over many years. As the thyroid slows more and more, the symptoms may become more easily identified. Of course, many of these symptoms also become more common with age in general.
If you suspect your symptoms are the result of a thyroid problem, talk with your doctor. They can order a blood test to determine whether you have hypothyroidism.
If you don�t already have a primary care doctor, you can browse doctors in your area through the Healthline FindCare tool.
Hypothyroidism symptoms in adults
Besides the most common hypothyroidism symptoms, research
indicates that hypothyroidism symptoms in men may also include erectile dysfunction.
Hypothyroidism symptoms in women may additionally include:
fertility difficulties
menstrual changes, particularly irregular or heavy periods
problems during pregnancy, including anemia
It�s also possible to develop hypothyroidism during pregnancy. Symptoms will usually be similar to those of other cases of hypothyroidism.
Hypothyroidism in young people
While hypothyroidism is less common in younger people, it can still occur. The condition may cause slower development in children and early puberty in teenagers.
Babies may also be born lacking thyroid function, a condition called congenital hypothyroidism. Symptoms of hypothyroidism in infants may include:
sleeping more than usual
constipation
difficulty with feeding
delayed growth (if the condition is untreated)
In some cases, babies with hypothyroidism may show no symptoms.
Severe hypothyroidism symptoms
If hypothyroidism isn�t treated, you may develop additional symptoms:
puffy, sensitive face
hoarseness
anemia
loss of hearing
In rare cases, severe hypothyroidism may result in myxedema coma, a life threatening condition that requires emergency care. While the condition does not actually involve being in a coma, you may experience:
fatigue
hypothermia
low blood pressure
low heart rate"
hypothyroidism,"for hypothyroidism, what causes hypothyroidism??","The most common causes of hypothyroidism are:
Hashimoto�s thyroiditis
radioactive iodine treatment
thyroid surgery
radiation therapy
medications
iodine deficiency
Less common causes include:
pituitary disorders
congenital disease
pregnancy
de Quervain thyroiditis
Hashimoto�s thyroiditis
Your immune system is designed to protect your body�s cells against invading bacteria and viruses. When unknown bacteria or viruses enter your body, your immune system responds by sending fighter cells to destroy the foreign cells.
Sometimes, your body confuses normal, healthy cells for invading cells. This is called an autoimmune response. If the autoimmune response isn�t regulated or treated, your immune system can attack healthy tissues. This can cause serious medical issues, including conditions such as hypothyroidism.
Hashimoto�s thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition and the most common cause
of an underactive thyroid in the United States. This disease attacks your thyroid gland, causing damage that reduces thyroid function.
It most often affects middle-aged women, but it can occur in men and children. This condition also runs in families. If a family member has received a diagnosis of this disease, then your risk of having it is higher.
Radioactive iodine treatment for hyperthyroidism
If your thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, you have a condition known as hyperthyroidism. Treatment for this condition aims to reduce and regulate thyroid hormone production.
Standard treatment for hyperthyroidism uses radioactive iodine to destroy thyroid cells. This may cause the levels of your thyroid hormone to remain low permanently.
Surgical removal of your thyroid
If your entire thyroid gland is removed as a result of thyroid problems, you�ll develop hypothyroidism. Using thyroid medication long term is the primary treatment.
If only a portion of the gland is removed, your thyroid may still be able to produce enough hormones on its own. Blood tests will help determine how much thyroid medication you may need.
Radiation therapy
If you�ve received a diagnosis of cancer of the head or neck, lymphoma, or leukemia, you may have undergone radiation therapy. Radiation used for the treatment of these conditions may slow or halt the production of thyroid hormone, leading to hypothyroidism.
Medications
Several medications may lower thyroid hormone production, resulting in hypothyroidism. These include ones used to treat mental health conditions, cancer, or heart disease, such as:
lithium, which treats mania in bipolar disorder
interleukin-2 (IL-2), an immunotherapy drug
anti-CTLA-4 medications, which treat melanoma
amiodarone (Pacerone), an antiarrhythmic drug
stavudine, a medication for HIV
Iodine deficiency
Iodine deficiency occurs infrequently in the United States, but it is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in other parts of the world. Iodine, which is needed to produce thyroid hormone, is found in foods including:
iodized salt
dairy
seafood
eggs
If you have iodine deficiency, you may develop swelling at the base of your neck. This is called a goiter. It�s caused by an enlarged thyroid gland.
Pituitary disorders
Hypothyroidism may also result from problems involving the pituitary gland. This small gland in the brain produces hormones that affect many bodily functions, including the thyroid gland.
Problems with the pituitary gland may cause thyroid issues. Pituitary disorders may result from:
pituitary tumors
medications like dopamine and opioids
radiation therapy around the brain
Sheehan syndrome, which damages the pituitary gland
This type of hypothyroidism is called secondary hypothyroidism because the thyroid gland functions normally. It�s less common than primary hypothyroidism, which is caused by a problem with the thyroid gland.
Congenital disease
Congenital hypothyroidism is hypothyroidism that�s present in children from birth. It affects between 1 in 2,000 and 1 in 4,000 newborns and is twice as common in females.
The condition occurs when the thyroid gland develops abnormally or is not present at all. Genetics or iodine deficiency may cause this. While some babies may show no symptoms, others will be less active or have trouble feeding.
U.S. hospitals test newborns for the condition. It�s important to treat congenital hypothyroidism to prevent it from delaying growth or mental development.
Pregnancy
Around 5
to 10 percent
of pregnant people will develop postpartum thyroiditis several months after their pregnancy. While only some will need treatment, others will develop permanent hypothyroidism.
The following can increase the risk of postpartum thyroiditis:
history of postpartum thyroiditis
presence of antibodies to thyroid peroxidase in the blood
type 1 diabetes
De Quervain thyroiditis
An upper respiratory infection that damages thyroid cells may cause De Quervain thyroiditis, an uncommon condition that is also called subacute granulomatous thyroiditis. It�s most common in women and often occurs during the summer and fall
.
Symptoms of de Quervain thyroiditis include:
pain in the neck, jaw, and throat
enlarged, tender thyroid gland
fever
fatigue
body pain
The condition may cause hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism and last 2 to 8 weeks. Typically, thyroid function will then return to normal, though in some cases hypothyroidism may be permanent."
hypothyroidism,"for hypothyroidism, what are the risk factors of hypothyroidism??","Factors that can increase your risk of developing hypothyroidism include:
being female
being at least 60 years old
being treated with radiation therapy to your neck or chest
recently being pregnant
having a family history of thyroid disorders
having certain autoimmune conditions, such as Sj�gren�s disease and type 1 diabetes"
hypothyroidism,"for hypothyroidism, how is hypothyroidism diagnosed??","Two primary tools are used to determine whether you have hypothyroidism: a medical evaluation and blood tests.
Medical evaluation
Your doctor will complete a thorough physical exam and medical history. They�ll check for physical signs of hypothyroidism, including:
dry skin
slowed reflexes
swelling in the neck
a slower heart rate
In addition, your doctor will ask you to report any symptoms you�ve been experiencing, such as fatigue, constipation, or constantly feeling cold.
If you have a known family history of thyroid conditions, tell your doctor during this exam.
Blood tests
Blood tests are the only way to reliably confirm a diagnosis of hypothyroidism.
A thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test measures how much TSH your pituitary gland is creating:
If your thyroid isn�t producing enough hormones, the pituitary gland will boost TSH to increase thyroid hormone production. The high TSH levels indicate hypothyroidism.
If you have hyperthyroidism, your TSH levels will be low, as your body is trying to stop excessive thyroid hormone production.
A thyroxine (T4) level test is also useful in diagnosing hypothyroidism. T4 is one of the hormones directly produced by your thyroid. Used together, T4 and TSH tests can help evaluate thyroid function.
Typically, if you have a low level of T4 along with a high level of TSH, you have hypothyroidism. If you have subclinical hypothyroidism, though, you may have normal T4 with a high TSH level.
Since there�s a spectrum of thyroid disease, other thyroid function tests may be necessary to properly diagnose your condition.
If your T4 test is normal, you may also receive a triiodothyronine (T3) test. Low T3 levels may indicate hypothyroidism, though again, T3 levels may be normal in subclinical hypothyroidism.
Finally, thyroid antibody tests look for antibodies in your blood to diagnose autoimmune thyroid disorders like Hashimoto�s thyroiditis."
hypothyroidism,"for hypothyroidism, which medications are available to treat hypothyroidism??","Hypothyroidism is a lifelong condition. For many people, medication reduces or alleviates symptoms.
Hypothyroidism is best treated by using levothyroxine (Levoxyl, Synthroid). This synthetic version of the T4 hormone copies the action of the thyroid hormone your body would normally produce.
The medication is designed to return adequate levels of thyroid hormone to your blood. Once hormone levels are restored, symptoms of the condition are likely to disappear or at least become much more manageable.
Once you start treatment, it will take several weeks before you�ll begin feeling relief. You�ll require follow-up blood tests to monitor your progress. You and your doctor will work together to find a dose and a treatment plan that best addresses your symptoms. This can take some time.
In most cases, people with hypothyroidism must remain on this medication their entire lives. However, the amount you take may need to be adjusted, especially if you have Hashimoto�s thyroiditis. To make sure your medication is still working properly, your doctor will likely test your TSH levels yearly.
If blood levels indicate the medication isn�t working as well as it should, your doctor will adjust the dose until a balance is achieved."
hypothyroidism,"for hypothyroidism, what alternative treatments may help hypothyroidism??","Besides standard thyroid medications, animal extracts that contain thyroid hormone are also available. These extracts come from the thyroid glands of pigs. They contain both T4 and triiodothyronine (T3).
If you take levothyroxine, you�re only receiving T4. However, that�s all you need because your body is capable of producing T3 from the synthetic T4.
Research has found medications with animal extracts to be similar to levothyroxine. Other studies have indicated that taking animal thyroid extract may reduce thyroid symptoms but cause more side effects. Currently, animal thyroid extracts aren�t routinely recommended.
You can also buy glandular extract supplements in some health food stores. Additionally, studies suggest that selenium supplements may help people with hypothyroidism caused by autoimmune disease, though research is mixed.
Note that dietary supplements aren�t regulated as drugs by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Because of this, their potency, legitimacy, and purity aren�t guaranteed.
Use these products at your own risk. It�s important to tell your doctor if you decide to try a supplement so they can adjust your treatment accordingly."
hypothyroidism,"for hypothyroidism, what are the complications of hypothyroidism??","Complications of hypothyroidism include:
heart problems
goiter
nerve injury
peripheral neuropathy
carpal tunnel syndrome
reduced kidney function
myxedema coma, in cases of severe disease
obstructive sleep apnea
mental health issues, like anxiety and depression
joint pain
balance issues
obesity, though the link
is still being studied, and moderate weight gain is most likely
high cholesterol
infertility
preeclampsia and anemia during pregnancy
birth defects"
hypothyroidism,"for hypothyroidism, are there special dietary recommendations for people with hypothyroidism??","As a general rule, you don�t need to follow a specific diet for hypothyroidism. However, there are some recommendations to keep in mind.
Eat a balanced diet
Your thyroid needs adequate amounts of iodine to fully function, but you don�t need to take an iodine supplement to achieve that.
There are plenty of iodine-rich foods, including:
iodized salt
dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese
eggs
seafood
seaweed
In general, a balanced diet should provide enough iodine for most people.
Monitor your soy intake
Soy may be linked to hypothyroidism. Drinking or eating too many soy products may lower thyroid function, especially in people with thyroid disorders. However, more research in this area is needed.
Soy is found in:
tofu
vegan cheese and meat products
soy milk
soybeans
soy sauce
It�s especially important for caregivers to monitor the soy intake of infants who need hypothyroidism treatment and also drink soy formula.
Be smart with fiber
Fiber may interfere with thyroid hormone absorption. Too much dietary fiber may prevent your body from getting the hormones it needs from thyroid medications.
Fiber is vital, so don�t skip it entirely. Instead, avoid taking your medication within several hours of eating high fiber foods.
Avoid taking thyroid medication with other supplements
If you take supplements or medications in addition to thyroid medications, try to take them at different times. Other medications can interfere with absorption, so it�s best to take your thyroid medication without other supplements, medications, or foods."
hypothyroidism,"for hypothyroidism, what are some tips for coping with hypothyroidism??","Even if you�re undergoing treatment, you may deal with long lasting issues or complications from hypothyroidism. However, there are ways to lessen the condition�s effect on your quality of life.
Monitor for other health conditions
There�s a link between other autoimmune diseases and hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism often goes along with conditions such as:
celiac disease
diabetes
rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
lupus
disorders affecting the adrenal gland
pituitary problems
Develop fatigue coping strategies
Despite taking medication, you may still experience fatigue from time to time. To help you manage low energy levels, it�s important that you:
get quality sleep each night
eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables
consider the use of stress-relieving mechanisms, such as meditation and yoga
A 2018 study found that yoga improved fatigue and other symptoms in a small group of people with hypothyroidism, though more research is needed.
Talk it out
Having a chronic health condition can be difficult, especially if it�s accompanied by other health concerns. Since hypothyroidism can cause depression and fatigue, it may also make your relationships more challenging.
Find people with whom you can openly express your feelings and experiences. This might be a:
mental health counselor
close friend
family member
support group of other people living with the condition
Some hospitals sponsor meetings for people with health conditions including hypothyroidism. Ask for a recommendation from your doctor and consider attending a meeting.
Research indicates that online communities may also help strengthen social connections, provide a supportive space, and help people with chronic illnesses share advice.
Support groups can help you connect with people who understand exactly what you�re experiencing while offering a guiding hand."
hypothyroidism,"for hypothyroidism, what�s the connection between hypothyroidism and depression??","When levels of thyroid hormones are low, your body�s natural functions lag. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weight gain, and even depression.
A small 2016 study found that 60 percent
of participants with hypothyroidism exhibited some symptoms of depression.
Hypothyroidism may cause a range of mental health difficulties. This can make diagnosing hypothyroidism difficult. Before making a treatment plan for mental health issues, doctors may consider testing for an underactive thyroid.
Depression and hypothyroidism can share several symptoms. These include:
fatigue
weight gain
depressed mood
reduced desire and satisfaction
difficulty concentrating
The two conditions also have symptoms that may distinguish them from one another. For hypothyroidism, problems such as dry skin, constipation, and hair loss are common. For depression alone, these conditions wouldn�t be expected.
Depression is often a diagnosis made based on symptoms and medical history. Low thyroid function is diagnosed with a physical exam and blood tests. To see whether there�s a link between your depression and your thyroid function, your doctor can order these tests for a definitive diagnosis.
If your depression is caused only by hypothyroidism, correcting the thyroid disorder should treat the depression. If it doesn�t, your doctor may prescribe medications for both conditions. They�ll slowly adjust your doses until your depression and hypothyroidism are better managed."
hypothyroidism,"for hypothyroidism, what�s the connection between hypothyroidism and anxiety??","While hypothyroidism has long been associated with depression, a 2016 study
suggested it may be associated with anxiety too.
Researchers evaluated 100 people between the ages of 18 and 45 who had a known history of hypothyroidism. Using an anxiety questionnaire, they found that around 63 percent of them met the criteria for some form of anxiety.
Larger and more focused studies on anxiety may help determine whether a true connection exists between hypothyroidism and anxiety.
It�s important for you and your doctor to discuss all your symptoms when being evaluated for thyroid or mental health conditions."
hypothyroidism,"for hypothyroidism, what�s the effect of hypothyroidism on pregnancy??","People with thyroid problems can and very often do have healthy pregnancies. Still, hypothyroidism can pose a particular set of challenges for pregnancy.
Low thyroid function or unmanaged hypothyroidism during pregnancy can cause:
anemia
miscarriage
preeclampsia
stillbirth
low birth weight
brain development problems
birth defects
If you have hypothyroidism and are pregnant, it�s important to take the following steps during the time you�re expecting:
Talk with your doctor about testing
You can develop hypothyroidism while pregnant. Some doctors routinely check thyroid levels during pregnancy to monitor for low thyroid hormone levels. If your levels are lower than they should be, your doctor may suggest treatment.
Some people who never had thyroid problems before they were pregnant may develop them after having a baby. This is called postpartum thyroiditis.
In many cases, the condition resolves within 12 to 18 months, and medication is no longer required. However, around 20 percent of people with postpartum thyroiditis will need long-term therapy.
Stay up to date with your medication
Continue to take your medication as prescribed. It�s common to have regular testing so your doctor can make any necessary adjustments to your thyroid medication as your pregnancy progresses. This ensures that the baby is getting enough thyroid hormone for their brain and nervous system to develop normally.
Eat well
Your body needs more nutrients, vitamins, and minerals while you�re pregnant. Eating a balanced diet and taking multivitamins while pregnant can help you maintain a healthy pregnancy.
It�s also important to get enough iodine, which is essential for producing thyroid hormone. Aim to consume around 250 micrograms
of iodine each day through food or supplements. Remember to talk with your doctor before starting any new supplements."
hypothyroidism,"for hypothyroidism, what�s the connection between hypothyroidism and weight gain??","Your thyroid is responsible for many of your body�s daily functions, including metabolism, organ function, and temperature control. When your body doesn�t produce enough thyroid hormone, all of these functions can slow down.
If your thyroid gland doesn�t function properly, your basal metabolic rate � a measurement of the amount of energy your body uses at rest � may be low. As a result, an underactive thyroid may lead to some weight gain. The more severe the condition is, the greater your weight gain is likely to be.
The typical amount of weight gain isn�t very high, though. Most people will gain somewhere between 5 and 10 pounds.
Properly treating the condition may lead you to lose any weight you gained while your thyroid levels were not treated. However, keep in mind that that�s not always the case. Symptoms of an underactive thyroid, including weight gain, often develop over a long period of time and may not be caused by a thyroid disorder alone.
If your weight stays the same, it doesn�t mean the condition isn�t being properly treated. Instead, it may indicate that your weight gain was the result of lifestyle or other conditions rather than low hormone levels."
hypothyroidism,"for hypothyroidism, what�s the connection between hypothyroidism and weight loss??","Once you�re treated for hypothyroidism, you may lose any weight you gained from low hormone levels. That�s because once your thyroid levels are restored, your ability to manage your weight returns to normal.
If you�re treating hypothyroidism but don�t see a change in your weight, you may still be able to lose weight if that�s a goal for you. Work with a doctor, registered dietitian, or personal trainer to develop a healthy eating plan and exercise strategy to reach or maintain a moderate weight."
hypothyroidism,"for hypothyroidism, the takeaway?","Your body naturally goes through changes as you get older. If you notice a significant difference in how you feel or how your body is responding, talk with your doctor to see whether a thyroid problem may be affecting you. If you�re a woman over age 60, remember that you�re at higher risk of a thyroid disorder.
If you have hypothyroidism, you�ll probably need to take thyroid medications for the rest of your life. Still, it�s likely that medication will help relieve or resolve your symptoms. You may also benefit from joining a support group for people living with hypothyroidism."

Could you provide information on malignant neoplasms or primary malignant neoplasm?,"A neoplasm is an abnormal growth of cells, also known as a tumor. Neoplastic diseases are conditions that cause tumor growth. Growth can be either benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous).
Benign tumors usually grow slowly and can�t spread to other tissues. Conversely, malignant tumors can grow at a slow pace, but they can also grow very fast depending on the exact tumor type. Malignant tumors carry the risk of metastasis or spreading to multiple tissues and organs.
In this article, we go over the causes of neoplastic disease, along with the disease�s symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment."
malignant neoplasms or primary malignant neoplasm,"for malignant neoplasms or primary malignant neoplasm, what are the causes of neoplastic disease??","The exact causes of tumor growth are still being researched. In general, cancerous tumor growth is triggered by DNA mutations within your cells.
Your DNA contains genes that tell cells how to operate, grow, and divide. Your cells can�t function normally when the DNA changes. This change is what causes cells to become cancerous.
There are a number of contributing factors that can cause your genes to mutate and result in benign or malignant tumor growth. Common factors include:
genetics
age
hormones
smoking
drinking
obesity
sun overexposure
immune disorders
viruses
overexposure to radiation

diarrhea
fever
bloody stools
lesions
skin masses
In some cases, neoplastic diseases show no symptoms.
Breast neoplasm symptoms
The most common symptom of breast cancer is a mass or lump. However, not all lumps and masses are cancerous. It�s best to visit a doctor right away if you find a lump. They�ll be able to run tests and confirm or rule out a cancer diagnosis.
If your breast neoplasm is cancerous, you may experience symptoms such as:
tenderness
pain
swelling
redness or irritation
change in breast shape
discharge
Lymph node neoplasm symptoms
A tumor in your lymph nodes or tissues can cause a noticeable swelling or mass in the affected area. A cancerous neoplasm in your lymph tissues is referred to as lymphoma.
Other symptoms of lymphoma include:
increased swelling in your neck, armpits, or groin
weight loss
fever

Other tests used to diagnose neoplastic diseases and cancers include:
CT scans
MRI scans
PET scans
mammograms
ultrasounds
X-rays
endoscopy"
malignant neoplasms or primary malignant neoplasm,"for malignant neoplasms or primary malignant neoplasm, how is neoplastic disease treated??","Your treatment will depend on the size and location of the tumor and on whether it�s benign or malignant. Some begin neoplasms won�t need any immediate treatment. When treatment is needed, it might include:
Monitoring. Benign growths don�t always need treatment, but a doctor will likely still want to keep an eye on them.
Surgery. One of the first treatment steps is often to remove the tumor surgically. Doctors might also remove some of the surrounding tissue.
Ablation. Ablation is a treatment that uses extreme heat or extreme cold to shrink and kill neoplasms.
Embolization. This treatment cuts off the blood flow to the tumor. This stops growth and kills the tumor.
Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is common treatment for malignant neoplastic diseases. It�s used to kill cancerous tumor cells in your body.
Radiation. Radiation treatments can target and kill cancer cells.
Hormonal therapy. Hormones encourage the growth of some types of neoplasms. Hormone therapy decreases the growth signals for some neoplasms.
Immunotherapy. Immunotherapy helps your immune system fight cancer cells. It can be used as a treatment for malignant neoplastic disease."
malignant neoplasms or primary malignant neoplasm,"for malignant neoplasms or primary malignant neoplasm, takeaway?","If you notice any unusual growths, moles, or skin rashes, schedule a visit with a doctor. Don�t try to self-diagnose tumors.
If you�ve been diagnosed with a benign neoplasm, a doctor may want to monitor your symptoms to identify any unusual activity. If it grows, you should contact a doctor. Benign tumors can become cancerous over time.
If you�ve been diagnosed with a malignant neoplastic disease such as cancer, you should consult with a doctor about treatment options.

Cellulitis can start in skin injuries, such as:
cuts
bug bites
surgical wounds"
cellulitis,"for cellulitis, what are the risk factors for cellulitis??","Several factors increase your chance
of getting cellulitis.
For example, you�re more likely to develop cellulitis if you have a skin condition like eczema or athlete�s foot. Bacteria can enter your skin through cracks caused by these conditions.
A weakened immune system also increases your risk of developing cellulitis because it can�t provide as much protection against the infection.

If you need help finding a primary care doctor, check out our FindCare tool here."
cellulitis,"for cellulitis, how is cellulitis treated??","Cellulitis treatment typically involves taking antibiotics by mouth for at least 5 days
. Your doctor may also prescribe pain relievers. However, in some cases, doctors will administer intravenous (IV) antibiotics as soon as they diagnose symptoms.
You should rest until your symptoms improve. Raising the affected limb higher than your heart can also help reduce swelling.
Cellulitis should go away within 7�10 days after you start taking antibiotics. You might need longer treatment if your infection is more severe.
Even if your symptoms improve within a few days, taking all the antibiotics your doctor prescribes is critical.
Surgery options
In most cases, a course of antibiotics will clear up the infection. However, if you have an abscess, a medical professional may need to drain it.
For surgery to drain the abscess, you first get medication to numb the area. Then, the surgeon makes a small cut in the abscess and drains the pus.
The surgeon then covers the wound with a dressing so it can heal. You may have a small scar afterward.
Home remedies
You should always see your doctor first if you have symptoms of cellulitis. Without treatment, it can spread and cause a life-threatening infection.
However, you can do things at home to relieve pain and other symptoms. For a start, you can clean your skin in the area where you have cellulitis. Ask your doctor how to properly clean and cover your wound.
For example, if your leg is affected, raise it above the level of your heart. This will help reduce swelling and relieve pain.

Your symptoms may worsen for the first 48 hours. However, they should begin to improve 2�3 days after you start taking antibiotics. You should always finish any course of antibiotics your doctor prescribes.
What other conditions may be confused with cellulitis?
Many conditions can present symptoms similar to those of cellulitis. They include:
venous stasis dermatitis (varicose eczema)
erysipelas
abscess
dermatitis
deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
How contagious is cellulitis?
Cellulitis usually doesn�t spread from person to person. It is possible to catch a bacterial skin infection if you have an open cut on your skin and it touches skin that has an active infection.
If you develop cellulitis from a transmitted infection, it could be dangerous if you don�t treat it on time. This is why it�s important to tell your doctor as soon as you notice symptoms of cellulitis.
Will cellulitis go away on its own?
Cellulitis is a bacterial skin infection that requires antibiotics to clear, so it�s unlikely to go away on its own.
What are the signs of sepsis from cellulitis?
Sepsis can develop if cellulitis isn�t treated and the bacteria spread to your bloodstream. Here are the symptoms of sepsis.

Can you elaborate on gastroesophageal reflux disease? What can you tell me about gastroesophageal reflux disease? Could you describe what gastroesophageal reflux disease is? I�d like to know more about gastroesophageal reflux disease. Can you help? What information do you have on gastroesophageal reflux disease? Could you provide information on gastroesophageal reflux disease?,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is when contents of your stomach persistently move back up into your esophagus. These contents sometimes contain excessive acid and may irritate your esophagus.
Many people may experience acid reflux, indigestion, or heartburn from time to time. However, if you experience acid reflux symptoms more than twice per week, you may have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
GERD affects about 20%
of people in the United States.
If left untreated, it may lead to serious complications.
Read on to learn more about the symptoms, causes, and treatments for GERD."
gastroesophageal reflux disease,"for gastroesophageal reflux disease, symptoms?","The most common symptom of GERD is persistent heartburn, which may involve:
a burning feeling in your stomach that may rise to your chest, neck, and throat
a sour or bitter taste at the back of your mouth
regurgitation of food or liquid from your stomach into your mouth
Other possible symptoms of GERD include:
a feeling of fullness or of a lump in the back of your throat (globus sensation)
chronic cough
a hoarse voice
bad breath
In some cases, people may experience alarm
symptoms associated with GERD. These are typically persistent and could progressively worsen despite medical treatment. Alarm symptoms may also indicate an underlying condition.
Alarm symptoms may include:
difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
pain when swallowing (odynophagia)
nausea or vomiting
weight loss
anemia
bleeding
If you�re experiencing any of these, get medical attention.
Heartburn or heart attack?
Heartburn and heart attacks are two common causes of chest pain. However, their causes and sensations are typically different:
Heartburn may occur when acidic contents of your stomach move back up into your esophagus. This may cause a burning sensation that rises from your stomach and radiates into your chest.
Heart attack is when your heart doesn�t get enough blood and oxygen due to a reduced flow of blood in one or more major arteries. This may cause sudden, uncomfortable, or sharp pain in the center or left side of your chest that feels like pressure or squeezing. It could spread to your neck, jaw, and shoulder too.
If you�re feeling any heart attack symptoms, such as shortness of breath or faintness, get medical assistance immediately.

Symptoms in infants
It�s normal for babies to sometimes spit up food or vomit. But if your baby is frequently spitting or vomiting, they may have GERD.
Other signs and symptoms of GERD in infants might include:
refusal to eat
trouble swallowing
gagging or choking
wet burps or hiccups
irritability or arching of the back during or after feeding
weight loss or poor growth
recurring cough or pneumonia
difficulty sleeping
If you suspect that your baby might have GERD or another health condition, speak with a doctor."
gastroesophageal reflux disease,"for gastroesophageal reflux disease, causes?","GERD commonly causes acid reflux, which may result from improper functioning of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).
The LES is a circular band of muscle at the end of your esophagus. When you swallow, it relaxes and opens up to allow food and liquid to travel from your mouth to your stomach. Then, it tightens and closes again.
Acid reflux happens when your LES doesn�t tighten or close properly. This allows digestive juices and other contents of your stomach to rise up into your esophagus.
Your LES may not function properly if you:
Have a hiatal hernia: This occurs when part of your stomach moves above your diaphragm toward your chest. If your diaphragm is compromised, it may prevent your LES from functioning properly.
Frequently eat large meals: This may cause distension of the upper part of your stomach. This distension sometimes means there isn�t enough pressure on the LES, and it doesn�t close properly.
Lie down too soon after meals: This might not create enough pressure for the LES to function properly.
Other factors, including those listed below, may also contribute to having heartburn more than twice a week.
Lifestyle factors
Lifestyle factors that may contribute to persistent reflux with esophageal inflammation include:
smoking or being exposed to secondhand smoke
eating large meals before lying down
using an abundance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen
Health factors
Health factors such as the following may contribute to GERD:
obesity
pregnancy
connective tissue disorders
older age
Other conditions
Other health conditions that can worsen the symptoms of GERD include:
anxiety
pregnancy
asthma
irritable bowel syndrome
Alcohol
Studies suggest that drinking alcohol may increase the risk of GERD. The greater the quantity of alcohol and frequency of consumption, the greater the correlation.
If you�ve received a diagnosis of GERD, limiting or stopping alcohol intake may provide symptom relief.
Dietary triggers
Some foods may trigger GERD symptoms more than others, including:
high fat foods such as fried and fast foods
spicy foods
certain fruits and vegetables, such as pineapple, tomato, and citrus
certain liquids, such as coffee, tea, and carbonated drinks"
gastroesophageal reflux disease,"for gastroesophageal reflux disease, diagnosis?","A doctor will typically take your medical history and perform a physical examination to assess your symptoms.
If you�re experiencing alarm symptoms, such as chest pain or trouble swallowing, they may refer you to a gastroenterologist or request certain tests, including:
Ambulatory 24-hour pH probe: A small tube is inserted through your nose into your esophagus. A pH sensor at the tip of the tube measures how much acid exposure your esophagus is getting and sends the data to a portable computer. You wear this tube for about 24 hours.
Esophagram: After you drink a barium solution, healthcare professionals use X-ray imaging to examine your upper digestive tract.
Upper endoscopy: A flexible tube with a tiny camera is threaded into your esophagus to examine it and collect a tissue sample (biopsy) if needed.
Esophageal manometry: A flexible tube is passed through your nose into your esophagus to measure the strength of your esophageal muscles.
Esophageal pH monitoring: A monitor is inserted into your esophagus to help healthcare professionals find out how acid is regulated in your body over a few days.
After arriving at a diagnosis, your doctor will speak with you to decide what treatment plan will work best for you."
gastroesophageal reflux disease,"for gastroesophageal reflux disease, treatment?","Lifestyle strategies
To manage and relieve symptoms of GERD, certain home remedies and lifestyle habits may help, including:
breathing exercises
consuming foods and liquids that may help with your acid reflux
making efforts to maintain a moderate weight
quitting smoking, if you smoke
avoiding eating big, heavy meals in the evening
waiting 2�3 hours after eating to lie down
elevating your head during sleep
Medication
If lifestyle strategies alone don�t help treat GERD, a doctor might prescribe medications to decrease your stomach acid secretion, since acid reflux is a common manifestation of GERD.
These may include:
proton pump inhibitors
antacids
H2 receptor blockers
Consult a doctor before taking medications because they may have negative side effects.
Surgery
In most cases, lifestyle strategies and medications are enough to prevent and relieve symptoms of GERD.
However, a doctor might recommend surgery if these approaches haven�t stopped your symptoms or if you�ve developed complications.
Possible surgery options include:
fundoplication
LINX reflux management system
bariatric surgery"
gastroesophageal reflux disease,"for gastroesophageal reflux disease, complications?","For most people, GERD doesn�t cause serious complications.
However, in rare cases, it may lead to serious or life threatening health problems such as:
esophagitis, which is inflammation of your esophagus
esophageal stricture, which happens when your esophagus narrows or tightens
Barrett�s esophagus, which involves permanent changes to the lining of your esophagus
esophageal cancer, which affects a small portion of people with Barrett�s esophagus
tooth enamel erosion, gum disease, or other dental problems
To lower your chances of complications, it�s important to take the steps to prevent, manage, and treat symptoms of GERD."

How do you know if you have GERD?
If you�re experiencing acid reflux, heartburn, or indigestion more than twice per week, speak with a doctor. This may be a symptom of GERD.
A doctor could diagnose GERD by assessing your symptoms, performing a physical exam, and considering your medical history. If you�re experiencing alarm symptoms, such as weight loss or difficulty swallowing, they may order other tests.
What is the fastest way to cure GERD?
Lifestyle and dietary changes may be the first intervention to help treat acid reflux. These may include:
avoiding certain foods and liquids
making efforts to maintain a moderate weight
quitting smoking, if you smoke
waiting 2�3 hours after eating to lie down
If lifestyle strategies don�t work, a doctor may prescribe medications such as:
proton pump inhibitors
antacids
H2 receptor blockers
If these don�t help treat GERD, you may need surgery."
gastroesophageal reflux disease,"for gastroesophageal reflux disease, takeaway?","If you experience heartburn every so often, you�re not alone. Lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medications are usually enough to address these occasional instances.
But if you�re experiencing heartburn more than twice per week and small lifestyle changes are not helping, you may be dealing with GERD.
If you�ve received a diagnosis of GERD, your doctor will help you find a treatment plan that works for you.
Don�t let persistent heartburn get in the way of living your life. Talk with a doctor if you believe you may have symptoms of GERD."
deep vein thrombosis,what is deep vein thrombosis? Tell me about deep vein thrombosis? What kind of disease is deep vein thrombosis? Can you elaborate on deep vein thrombosis? What can you tell me about deep vein thrombosis? Could you describe what deep vein thrombosis is? I�d like to know more about deep vein thrombosis. Can you help? What information do you have on deep vein thrombosis? Could you provide information on deep vein thrombosis?,"The changes that happen in the body during pregnancy can cause blood clotting. The risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is low, but symptoms may include swelling, pain in one leg, skin warmth and discoloration, visibly enlarged veins, and puffiness.
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that develops in a deep vein in the:
DVT is not common during pregnancy, but pregnant people are at least 5 times more likely
to develop DVT than people who aren�t pregnant, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Blood-clotting protein levels increase during pregnancy, while anticlotting protein levels decrease. This helps reduce the amount of blood lost during delivery.
The enlarging uterus during pregnancy may also increase the risk because it puts the veins of the lower body under additional pressure to return blood to the heart.
Read on to learn more about DVT and pregnancy."
deep vein thrombosis,"for deep vein thrombosis, symptoms?","The most obvious symptom of DVT is swelling and heavy pain or extreme tenderness in one of your legs. Approximately 82%
of DVT cases in pregnancy occur in the left leg. Other symptoms of DVT can include:
pain in the leg when standing or moving around
pain in the leg that worsens when you bend your foot up toward your knee
warm skin in the affected area
visible veins that appear enlarged
discoloration or red skin at the back of the leg, typically below the knee
bluish toes
slight to severe swelling
Around 50%
of people with acute DVT may be asymptomatic. It occurs more often in post-op patients, particularly those who have undergone orthopedic surgery.
The chances of having asymptomatic DVT before or after pregnancy are unlikely
. But those with multiple risk factors should receive adequate screening for DVT, especially after cesarean delivery."
deep vein thrombosis,"for deep vein thrombosis, is it a muscle cramp or a symptom of dvt??","You may experience muscle cramps during pregnancy. They typically affect the calf during the second and third trimesters, particularly at night. Muscle cramps during pregnancy are not a medical emergency.
They can be prevented or relieved with:
stretching and movement
hydration
massages
magnesium supplements
comfortable, supportive footwear
Swelling
Muscle cramps do not cause leg swelling. Unlike muscle cramps, stretching and moving around will not improve pain from DVT.

deep vein thrombosis,"for deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism vs. dvt?","A pulmonary embolism (PE) is a blood clot that travels to the lungs. DVT commonly
causes it. PE is rare during pregnancy but more common compared with people who are not pregnant. Symptoms of PE can include:
sudden shortness of breath
chest pain or tightness in the chest
a cough that produces blood-streaked sputum (mucus)
rapid heartbeat
PE is a medical emergency
If you or someone you know has PE symptoms such as shortness of breath or chest pain, contact 911 or your local emergency services immediately.

deep vein thrombosis,"for deep vein thrombosis, when should you see a doctor??",See a doctor as soon as possible if you suspect DVT. Diagnosed DVT is not a medical emergency and is unlikely to harm you or your baby unless there are serious complications. It�s best to get checked early to begin DVT treatment.
deep vein thrombosis,"for deep vein thrombosis, diagnosis?","It�s not always easy to diagnose DVT in pregnancy from symptoms alone. A doctor may order multiple tests to confirm the diagnosis, including:
D-dimer test: This blood test identifies pieces of a blood clot that have broken off into your bloodstream. D-dimer levels above a certain threshold may indicate
a higher risk of PE, but doctors typically conduct further testing because levels normally fluctuate during pregnancy.
Doppler ultrasound: This scan determines how fast blood flows through a blood vessel. A Doppler ultrasound helps a healthcare team establish whether blood flow is slowed or blocked, a possible sign that indicates a blood clot.
Venogram: If a D-dimer test and ultrasound cannot confirm a DVT diagnosis, a doctor may use a venogram or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A venogram involves injecting a liquid called a contrast dye into a vein in your foot. The dye moves up the leg. The dye shows on an X-ray, which pinpoints a gap in the blood vessel where the clot stops the blood flow.
According to a 2019 review of over 40 studies, a venogram is the �gold standard� for a DVT diagnosis."
deep vein thrombosis,"for deep vein thrombosis, treatment?","A doctor can form a treatment plan if you develop DVT during pregnancy. They may refer you to a specialist, such as a hematologist (blood specialist) and a maternal medicine or obstetric medicine specialist.
To treat DVT, a doctor may recommend once or twice daily injections of the blood-thinning agent low-molecular-weight heparin. This treatment may help to:
stop the clot from getting bigger
help the clot dissolve in the body
reduce the risk of further clots
You�ll likely have regular checkups and blood tests to ensure the clot dissolves and no further clots appear.
A doctor may recommend at-home practices for DVT in addition to medication. These may include daily walks, keeping the affected leg elevated when sitting, and following your prescribed anticoagulant medication schedule."
deep vein thrombosis,"for deep vein thrombosis, effects on the baby?","DVT during pregnancy typically does not affect the baby unless there are serious complications. Doctors and researchers consider heparin safe to use during pregnancy because it doesn�t cross the placenta, so there is no risk to your baby.
Depending on your anticoagulation regimen, you must stop taking injections as soon as you begin labor, or at least 12 to 24 hours before inducing labor or a planned cesarean delivery.
If you want to nurse your baby, you will have to stop the injections after birth. For those with a mechanical heart valve, a doctor may prescribe warfarin (Jantoven) to ensure the baby�s blood doesn�t thin.
This medication carries significant risks for you and your baby, particularly before birth. Fetuses exposed to warfarin may develop
congenital disabilities.
Discuss whether the benefits outweigh the risks with a doctor. Together, you may decide not to breastfeed or to stop taking anticoagulants while nursing your baby."
deep vein thrombosis,"for deep vein thrombosis, other complications?","Untreated, DVT can have lasting effects on the body.
Long-term DVT can lead to permanent swelling of the veins and fluid retention.
In rare cases, a clot can dislodge and move to the lungs, resulting in a PE.
Another rare complication from DVT is venous gangrene of the toes or fingers.
Irreparable damage to the veins from DVT may result in chronic post-thrombotic syndrome. This is a collection of symptoms associated with leg pain and ulcers.
Finally, taking anticoagulants raises the risk of side effects like bleeding. Report any unusual bleeding, such as nose bleeds, bloody stool/urine, or bruising, to a doctor if you take these medications."
deep vein thrombosis,"for deep vein thrombosis, risk factors?","Factors that can increase your risk for DVT during pregnancy include:
having a previous history of clots or DVT
having a family history of DVT
being over 35
having a BMI of 30 or higher
carrying twins or multiple babies
having fertility treatment
having had a previous, recent cesarean delivery
sitting still or being bedridden for long periods
smoking
having preeclampsia
having certain chronic conditions such as high blood pressure (hypertension) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
having severe varicose veins
Race and DVT risk
Research indicates that DVT and PE occur more frequently
in Black Americans than in white Americans. The researchers speculate that this disparity has to do with increased risk factors, such as higher BMI and blood clotting protein levels. The data did not take pregnancy into account.
Was this helpful?"
deep vein thrombosis,"for deep vein thrombosis, prevention?","There isn�t a way to definitively prevent DVT in pregnancy. But taking certain steps can help to reduce your risk:
Stay active with pregnancy-safe exercises.
Wear compression socks during air travel and walk around at least once every hour.
Move your legs when sitting down, for example, by raising and lowering your heels and your toes and flexing your ankle.
Wear support hose.
Quit smoking, if you smoke.
See a doctor immediately if you notice any pain, tenderness, redness, or swelling in your legs.
Pregnant people at high risk for DVT may receive
a preventive dose of heparin, either during the entire pregnancy or for 6 to 8 weeks postpartum."
deep vein thrombosis,"for deep vein thrombosis, outlook?","While DVT isn�t common in pregnancy, it�s a serious condition that can be fatal if the clot dislodges and moves into the lungs.
Be aware of the symptoms and risk factors if you are pregnant or at risk for DVT. Let a healthcare professional know right away if you suspect DVT.
Early treatment and ongoing management can help keep you and your baby safe."
deep vein thrombosis,"for deep vein thrombosis, takeaway?","Before labor and even after you have your baby, it�s important to regularly check your legs for signs of DVT. Diagnosed DVT related to pregnancy is treatable.
Since pregnancy alters the body�s natural anticlotting process, doctors may recommend that people with pre-existing blood clotting disorders and a higher BMI take extra precautions."

Could you describe what dehydration is? I�d like to know more about dehydration. Can you help? What information do you have on dehydration? Could you provide information on dehydration?,"Your body regularly loses water through sweating and urination. If it isn�t replaced, you get dehydrated. Adults at risk include athletes, people who work in the heat, older adults, and those with chronic conditions.
Dehydration takes place when your body loses more fluid than you drink. Common causes of dehydration include:
The Mayo Clinic recommends women drink 92 fluid ounces (11.5 cups) per day and men drink 124 fluid ounces (15.5 cups) daily. Individuals on the go, athletes and people exposed to high temperatures should increase their water intake to avoid dehydration.
When too much water is lost from the body, its organs, cells, and tissues fail to function as they should, which can lead to dangerous complications. If dehydration isn�t corrected immediately, it could cause shock.
Dehydration can be mild or severe. You can usually treat mild dehydration at home. Severe dehydration needs to be treated in a hospital or emergency care setting."
dehydration,"for dehydration, dehydration risk factors?","Athletes exposed to direct sun aren�t the only ones at risk for dehydration. In fact, bodybuilders and swimmers are among the athletes who commonly develop the condition, too. Strange as it may seem, it�s possible to sweat in water. Swimmers lose a lot of sweat when swimming.
Some people have a higher risk for developing dehydration than others, including:
people working outdoors who are exposed to excessive amounts of heat (for example, welders, landscapers, construction workers, and mechanics)
older adults
people with chronic conditions
athletes (especially runners, cyclists, and soccer players)
infants and young children
people who reside in high altitudes"
dehydration,"for dehydration, how does dehydration develop??","Any situation or condition that causes the body to lose more water than usual leads to dehydration.
Sweating
Sweating is part of your body�s natural cooling process. When you become hot, your sweat glands activate to release moisture from your body in an attempt to cool it off. The way this works is by evaporation.
As a drop of sweat evaporates from your skin, it takes a small amount of heat with it. The more sweat you produce, the more evaporation there is, and the more you�re cooled off. Sweating also hydrates your skin and maintains the balance of electrolytes in your body.
The fluid you sweat comprises mainly salt and water. Excessive sweating can cause dehydration since you lose a large amount of water. The technical term for excessive sweating is hyperhidrosis.
Illness
Illnesses that cause continuous vomiting or diarrhea can result in dehydration. This is because vomiting and diarrhea can cause too much water to be expelled from your body.
Important electrolytes are also lost through these processes. Electrolytes are minerals used by the body to control the muscles, blood chemistry, and organ processes. These electrolytes are found in blood, urine, and other fluids in the body.
Vomiting or diarrhea can impair these functions and cause severe complications, such as stroke and coma.
Fever
If you have a fever, your body loses fluid through your skin�s surface in an attempt to lower your temperature. Often, fever can cause you to sweat so much that if you don�t drink to replenish, you could end up dehydrated.
Urination
Urination is the body�s normal way to release toxins from your body. Some conditions can cause chemical imbalances, which can increase your urine output. If you don�t replace the fluid lost through excessive urination, you risk developing dehydration."
dehydration,"for dehydration, what are the signs of dehydration??","The symptoms of dehydration differ depending on whether the condition is mild or severe. Symptoms of dehydration may begin to appear before total dehydration takes place.
Symptoms of mild to moderate dehydration include:
fatigue
dry mouth
increased thirst
decreased urination
less tear production
dry skin
constipation
dizziness
lightheadedness
headache
In addition to the symptoms of mild dehydration, severe dehydration is likely to cause the following:
excessive thirst
lack of sweat production
low blood pressure
rapid heart rate
rapid breathing
sunken eyes
shriveled skin
dark urine
Severe dehydration is a medical emergency. Get immediate medical help if you�re showing any of these signs and symptoms.
Medical emergency
Children and older adults should receive immediate treatment, even if they�re experiencing symptoms of mild dehydration.
If a person in any age group develops the following symptoms, seek emergency care:
severe diarrhea
blood in the stool
diarrhea for 3 or more days
inability to keep fluids down
disorientation"
dehydration,"for dehydration, how is dehydration diagnosed??","Before beginning any tests, your doctor will go over any symptoms you have to rule out other conditions. After taking your medical history, your doctor will check your vital signs, including your heart rate and blood pressure. Low blood pressure and rapid heart rate can indicate dehydration.
Your doctor may use a blood test to check your level of electrolytes, which can help indicate fluid loss. A blood test can also check your body�s level of creatinine. This helps your doctor determine how well your kidneys are functioning, an indicator of the degree of dehydration.
A urinalysis is an exam that uses a sample of urine to check for the presence of bacteria and electrolyte loss. The color of your urine can also indicate dehydration when combined with other symptoms. Dark urine alone can�t diagnosis dehydration."
dehydration,"for dehydration, strategies to treat dehydration?","Treatments for dehydration include rehydrating methods, electrolyte replacement, and treating diarrhea or vomiting, if needed.
Rehydration
Rehydration by drinking may not be possible for all people, like those who have severe diarrhea or vomiting. In this case, fluids can be given intravenously.
To do this, a small IV tube is inserted in a vein in the arm or hand. It provides a solution that�s often a mix of water and electrolytes.
For those able to drink, drinking water along with an electrolyte-containing rehydration drink, such as a low-sugar sports or electrolyte drink, may be recommended. Children with dehydration are often directed to drink Pedialyte.
Homemade rehydration solution
If an electrolyte drink isn�t available, you can make your own rehydration solution using:
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 teaspoons sugar
1 liter water
Be absolutely certain that you�re using an accurate measurement. Using too much salt or sugar can be dangerous.
Things to avoid
Avoid soda, alcohol, overly sweet drinks, or caffeine. These drinks can worsen dehydration."
dehydration,"for dehydration, potential complications of untreated dehydration?","Untreated dehydration can lead to life-threatening complications, such as:
heat exhaustion
heat cramps
heatstroke
seizures due to electrolyte loss
low blood volume
kidney failure
coma"
dehydration,"for dehydration, how can i prevent dehydration??","Here are some ways to prevent dehydration:
If you�re ill, increase your fluid intake, especially if you�re vomiting or having diarrhea. If you can�t keep down liquids, seek medical attention.
If you�re going to exercise or play sports, drink water before the activity. At regular intervals during the workout, replace your fluids. Make sure to drink water or electrolytes after exercise, too.
Dress cool in hot months, and avoid being out in direct heat if you can avoid it.
Even if you aren�t active, drink the recommended amount of fluids."
dehydration,"for dehydration, takeaway?","Dehydration occurs when you�re not getting enough fluids. Whether it�s from exercising, hot weather, or an illness, dehydration can quickly become dangerous � no matter the cause.

I�d like to know more about neoplasm. Can you help? What information do you have on neoplasm? Could you provide information on neoplasm?,"A neoplasm is an abnormal growth of cells, also known as a tumor. Neoplastic diseases are conditions that cause tumor growth. Growth can be either benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous).
Benign tumors usually grow slowly and can�t spread to other tissues. Conversely, malignant tumors can grow at a slow pace, but they can also grow very fast depending on the exact tumor type. Malignant tumors carry the risk of metastasis or spreading to multiple tissues and organs.
In this article, we go over the causes of neoplastic disease, along with the disease�s symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment."
neoplasm,"for neoplasm, what are the causes of neoplastic disease??","The exact causes of tumor growth are still being researched. In general, cancerous tumor growth is triggered by DNA mutations within your cells.
Your DNA contains genes that tell cells how to operate, grow, and divide. Your cells can�t function normally when the DNA changes. This change is what causes cells to become cancerous.
There are a number of contributing factors that can cause your genes to mutate and result in benign or malignant tumor growth. Common factors include:
genetics
age

fever
bloody stools
lesions
skin masses
In some cases, neoplastic diseases show no symptoms.
Breast neoplasm symptoms
The most common symptom of breast cancer is a mass or lump. However, not all lumps and masses are cancerous. It�s best to visit a doctor right away if you find a lump. They�ll be able to run tests and confirm or rule out a cancer diagnosis.
If your breast neoplasm is cancerous, you may experience symptoms such as:
tenderness
pain
swelling
redness or irritation
change in breast shape
discharge
Lymph node neoplasm symptoms
A tumor in your lymph nodes or tissues can cause a noticeable swelling or mass in the affected area. A cancerous neoplasm in your lymph tissues is referred to as lymphoma.
Other symptoms of lymphoma include:
increased swelling in your neck, armpits, or groin

endoscopy"
neoplasm,"for neoplasm, how is neoplastic disease treated??","Your treatment will depend on the size and location of the tumor and on whether it�s benign or malignant. Some begin neoplasms won�t need any immediate treatment. When treatment is needed, it might include:
Monitoring. Benign growths don�t always need treatment, but a doctor will likely still want to keep an eye on them.
Surgery. One of the first treatment steps is often to remove the tumor surgically. Doctors might also remove some of the surrounding tissue.
Ablation. Ablation is a treatment that uses extreme heat or extreme cold to shrink and kill neoplasms.
Embolization. This treatment cuts off the blood flow to the tumor. This stops growth and kills the tumor.
Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is common treatment for malignant neoplastic diseases. It�s used to kill cancerous tumor cells in your body.
Radiation. Radiation treatments can target and kill cancer cells.
Hormonal therapy. Hormones encourage the growth of some types of neoplasms. Hormone therapy decreases the growth signals for some neoplasms.
Immunotherapy. Immunotherapy helps your immune system fight cancer cells. It can be used as a treatment for malignant neoplastic disease."
neoplasm,"for neoplasm, takeaway?","If you notice any unusual growths, moles, or skin rashes, schedule a visit with a doctor. Don�t try to self-diagnose tumors.
If you�ve been diagnosed with a benign neoplasm, a doctor may want to monitor your symptoms to identify any unusual activity. If it grows, you should contact a doctor. Benign tumors can become cancerous over time.
If you�ve been diagnosed with a malignant neoplastic disease such as cancer, you should consult with a doctor about treatment options.
Early diagnosis will give you the best treatment options for your condition."

embolism pulmonary,"for embolism pulmonary, what causes a pulmonary embolism??","Blood clots can form for a variety of reasons. PEs are most often caused by deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a condition in which blood clots form in veins deep in the body. The blood clots that most often cause PEs begin in the legs or pelvis.
Blood clots in the deep veins of the body can have several different causes, including:
Injury or damage. Injuries like bone fractures or muscle tears can cause damage to blood vessels, leading to clots.
Inactivity. During long periods of inactivity, gravity causes blood to collect in the lowest areas of your body, which may lead to a blood clot. This could occur if you�re sitting for a lengthy trip or if you�re lying in bed recovering from an illness.
Medical conditions. Some health conditions cause blood to clot easily, which can lead to PE. Treatments that involve surgery often lead to short-term bed rest or limited movement, which can make clotting more likely. Also, certain medical therapies for cancer can have side effects such as clotting in the blood. This puts you at risk for DVT and PE.
There are additional risk factors that increase your odds of having the type of blood clot that can cause PE."
embolism pulmonary,"for embolism pulmonary, how is a pulmonary embolism diagnosed??","PE has a wide variety of characteristics, ranging from no symptoms to sudden death. The most common presenting symptom is shortness of breath followed by chest pain and cough. However, many people with PE have mild or nonspecific symptoms or are asymptomatic, including people with a large PE.
When you talk with a doctor about your symptoms, they�ll ask about your overall health and any preexisting conditions you may have.
A doctor will typically perform one or more of the following tests to discover the cause of your symptoms:
Chest X-ray. This is a standard, noninvasive test that lets a doctor see your heart and lungs to look for other obvious causes of your symptoms. A PE can not be diagnosed with this test. The most common finding of a PE on a chest X-ray is �normal.�
Electrocardiography (ECG). An ECG measures your heart�s electrical activity. A PE can not be diagnosed on an ECG. This test will check for other causes of chest pain.
Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). This test is the first-choice diagnostic imaging method because it�s sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of PE. However, it requires the use of intravenous (IV) contrast. Therefore, people with kidney problems will likely not be able to have this test because contrast may cause or worsen kidney disease. When a CTPA can not be performed, the doctor may instead consider a VQ scan to diagnose a PE.
Ventilation/perfusion scan (VQ). A VQ scan is carried out in two parts. In the first part, radioactive material is breathed in, and pictures are taken to look at the airflow in your lungs. In the second part, a different radioactive material is injected into a vein in your arm, and more images are taken to see the blood flow in your lungs. This is mostly reserved for when:
you can not receive a CTPA
the results of the CPTA were inconclusive
more testing is needed
Magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography (MRPA). This is not recommended as a first-line test for diagnosing PE, but it may be an imaging option to diagnose PE in people who can neither receive a CTPA nor a VQ scan. Potential advantages of MRPA are that no ionizing radiation is involved, and the examination can be combined with MR venography in the same sitting to look for DVT.
Venography. A venogram is an invasive test that is rarely used for the diagnosis of only a DVT. This is a specialized X-ray of the veins in your legs and also requires the use of contrast.
Pulmonary angiography. A pulmonary angiography is an invasive test that�s rarely used to diagnose an acute PE. It involves making a small incision so a doctor can guide specialized tools through your veins. The doctor will use contrast to see the blood vessels in the lung.
Duplex venous ultrasound. This is a practical and noninvasive test to only diagnose a DVT. It�s important to remember that you can still have a PE even if the ultrasound is negative for a DVT. This test uses radio waves to visualize the blood flow and check for blood clots in your legs.
D-dimer test. This is a type of blood test used to screen for signs of a PE or DVT based on the your probability of having a clot. A doctor can not make a diagnosis based on this blood test. If the result is positive, the doctor must confirm the diagnosis with the appropriate imaging method.
Acute PE, a blockage in the lung artery, often from a blood clot, is a common and sometimes fatal disease. When you�re evaluated for a PE, it�s often important for the evaluation to be efficient and avoid unnecessary testing so you can start therapy quickly.

embolism pulmonary,"for embolism pulmonary, what are the risk factors for a pulmonary embolism??","Factors that increase your risk of developing DVT and PE include:
cancer
a family history of embolisms
hypercoagulable states (blood prone to clotting) or genetic blood clotting disorders, including:
factor V Leiden
prothrombin gene mutation
high levels of homocysteine
a history of heart attack or stroke
obesity
a sedentary lifestyle
taking estrogen or testosterone

embolism pulmonary,"for embolism pulmonary, how is a pulmonary embolism treated??","Your treatment for a PE depends on the size and location of the blood clot. If the problem is minor and caught early, a doctor may recommend medication as treatment. Some drugs can break up small clots.
A doctor may prescribe:
Anticoagulants. Also called blood thinners, medications such as heparin and warfarin prevent new clots from forming in your blood. They can save your life in an emergency situation. Another commonly used category of anticoagulant is the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as rivaroxaban (Xarelto) and apixaban (Eliquis). These medications are FDA approved for the treatment and prevention of PE and DVT.
Clot dissolvers (thrombolytics). These drugs break down a clot to improve blood flow and perfusion. They are reserved for people hospitalized in emergency situations because side effects may include dangerous bleeding problems.
Minimally invasive procedures or surgery may be necessary if you�re unstable because of the problematic clots and you need urgent reperfusion to improve blood flow to your lungs and heart, especially when thrombolytics can not be used.
Some procedures a doctor may use in the case of a pulmonary embolism include:
Catheter directed methods. These are used for clot removal and breakdown. A thin tube called a catheter will suction out, break down, or dissolve clots in your pulmonary artery.
Open surgery. Doctors use open surgery only in emergency situations when:
minimally invasive catheter directed methods are not available
medications aren�t working to break up the clot
medications are contraindicated or carry too many risks for the patient"
embolism pulmonary,"for embolism pulmonary, prevention?","After you receive proper treatment for a pulmonary embolism at the hospital, you�ll be advised to treat the underlying cause of the PE or DVT if it�s known.
You�ll most likely start taking anticoagulant medications, such as heparin, warfarin, or newer agents referred to as direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), to prevent blood clots from returning.
Regularly exercising your legs and practicing health-promoting behaviors are key components of prevention and therapy after a PE. A doctor will give you complete instructions on how to care for yourself to prevent future blood clots."
embolism pulmonary,"for embolism pulmonary, takeaway?","A pulmonary embolism occurs when a blood clot reaches the lungs. These blood clots often come from deep vein thrombosis, which can result from damage to bone and muscle or from long periods of inactivity. Many times the exact cause of a DVT or PE is unknown despite a thorough evaluation.
A PE can be very dangerous, so it�s important to contact a medical professional if you�re experiencing symptoms such as chest pain, spitting up blood, and fainting.
A doctor will typically prescribe medications that thin the blood and, in certain cases, use medications that break up blood clots. Minimally invasive interventional procedures and surgery may be required in some instances."
epilepsy,what is epilepsy? Tell me about epilepsy? What kind of disease is epilepsy? Can you elaborate on epilepsy? What can you tell me about epilepsy? Could you describe what epilepsy is? I�d like to know more about epilepsy. Can you help? What information do you have on epilepsy? Could you provide information on epilepsy?,"A seizure is a sudden change in movement or awareness due to a change in the electrical function of the brain. Sudden bursts of electrical energy may affect movement, sensation and consciousness.
Seizures are changes in the brain�s electrical activity. These changes can cause dramatic, noticeable symptoms, subtle or mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all.
The symptoms of a severe seizure include repetitive jerking and stiffening and a loss of control. Because some seizures can lead to injury or be a sign of an underlying medical condition, it�s important to seek treatment if you experience them."
epilepsy,"for epilepsy, what are the types of seizures??","The three
major types are focal onset seizures, generalized onset seizures, and unknown onset seizures.
Focal onset seizures
Focal onset seizures begin in only one area
of the brain. People may also refer to these as partial seizures.
Focal onset seizures start in small areas of the brain, such as a single lobe, but can affect large areas.
Medical professionals typically split focal onset seizures into two types: focal aware seizures and focal awareness-impaired seizures.
Focal aware seizure
During a focal aware seizure, you�ll remain fully conscious and be aware that something is happening, even if you don�t recognize it as a seizure.
The symptoms of a focal aware seizure will depend on which part of the brain the seizure starts.
Focal aware seizures may be singular events but can also develop into other types of seizures. For this reason, people often refer to them as warnings or auras.
Focal impaired-awareness seizure
This type of seizure affects your consciousness. During a focal impaired-awareness seizure, you may not be able to move, talk, or hear as you did before. You may also not be able to remember the event.
Focal impaired-awareness seizures can last for up to 2 minutes
. This type of seizure typically affects a larger portion of the brain than focal aware seizures.
Generalized onset seizures
These seizures start in both sides of the brain simultaneously. Among the more common types of generalized onset seizures are:
Tonic: Tonic seizures will result in your muscles stiffening up.
Clonic: The convulsions in clonic seizures may cause abnormal, jerky movements of your limbs. You will likely lose consciousness during these seizures that can last for a few minutes.
Tonic-clonic: Tonic-clonic seizures include a combination of both tonic and clonic symptoms.
Myoclonic: During a myoclonic seizure you may experience sudden muscle spasms. These are typically too short-lived to affect consciousness and pass quickly. Myoclonic seizures may be of generalized onset as well as focal onset.
Absence: People may also refer to these as petit mal seizures. Absence seizures last for only a few seconds. They can cause you to blink repeatedly or stare into space. Other people may mistakenly think you�re daydreaming.
Atonic: During atonic seizures your muscles suddenly go limp. Your head may nod, or your entire body could fall to the ground. Atonic seizures are brief, lasting about 15 seconds. People may refer to these seizures as drop attacks.
Unknown onset seizures
Sometimes no one witnesses the beginning of a seizure. For example, someone may wake up in the middle of the night and observe their partner having a seizure."
epilepsy,"for epilepsy, what are the symptoms of a seizure??","A person can have an epilepsy condition that causes both focal and generalized seizures at different times, but not simultaneously.
A focal seizure can progress to become a generalized seizure. Sometimes this happens slowly and sometimes it can happen rapidly.
Sometimes symptoms occur before the seizure takes place. These can include:
a sudden feeling of fear or anxiousness
a feeling of being sick to your stomach
dizziness
a change in vision
a jerky movement of the arms and legs that may cause you to drop things
an out-of-body sensation
a headache
d�j� vu
mood changes
Signs that indicate a seizure is in progress include:
losing consciousness, followed by confusion
having uncontrollable muscle spasms
drooling or frothing at the mouth
falling
having a strange taste in your mouth
clenching your teeth
biting your tongue
having sudden, rapid eye movements
making unusual noises, such as grunting
losing control of bladder or bowel function
Learn more about what a seizure feels like here."
epilepsy,"for epilepsy, what causes seizures??","Seizures can stem from several health conditions. Some examples include:
alcohol withdrawal
a brain infection, such as meningitis
a brain injury during childbirth
a brain irregularity present at birth
choking
substance use
substance withdrawal
an electrolyte imbalance
electric shock
epilepsy
extremely high blood pressure
fever
head trauma
kidney or liver failure
low blood glucose levels
a stroke
a brain tumor
vascular abnormality in the brain
Seizures can run in families. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has a history of seizures. In some instances, especially with young children, the cause of the seizure may be unknown."
epilepsy,"for epilepsy, what are the effects of seizures??","Living with epilepsy and experiencing repeated seizures can have both short- and long-term effects. These can range from a drop in quality of life to increased risks of mental health conditions.
Short-term effects
Some seizures can cause you to lose total control of your body. This can lead to falls and other movements that can result in injury.
People with epilepsy typically have more
physical issues, such as bruising and fractures, than people without the condition.
Being prone to seizures may also affect your quality of life. For example, you may no longer be able to drive. You may want to avoid situations where a seizure could cause serious harm, such as swimming or traveling alone.
It�s important to wear a medical identification bracelet that tells emergency responders that you have epilepsy.
Long-term effects
If you don�t get treatment for seizures, their symptoms can become worse and progressively last longer. Prolonged seizures can lead to coma or death.
While death as a direct result of seizures is rare, the risk of premature death in people with epilepsy is up to three times higher
than in the general population.
Living with epilepsy can have an impact on your mental health. People living with epilepsy may be depressed or anxious due to the worry of having a seizure. They may also feel isolated, be worried about getting hurt or experience stigma.
The changes in the brain that can cause epilepsy may be associated with the different brain changes that can cause psychiatric comorbidities. Up to 30%
of people with epilepsy also have a serious mental health condition like bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and severe depression.
Learn more about the long-term outlook for people with epilepsy here."
epilepsy,"for epilepsy, how are seizures diagnosed??","Your doctor may recommend specific tests to accurately diagnose a seizure and help ensure that the treatments they recommend will be effective.
Your doctor will consider your complete medical history and the events leading up to the seizure. For example, migraine, headaches, sleep disorders, and extreme psychological stress can cause seizure-like symptoms.
Lab tests may help your doctor rule out other conditions that can cause seizure-like activity. The tests may include:
blood testing to check for electrolyte imbalances
a spinal tap to rule out infection
a toxicology screening to test for drugs, poisons, or toxins
An electroencephalogram (EEG) can help your doctor diagnose a seizure. This test measures your brain waves. Viewing brain waves during a seizure can help your doctor diagnose the type of seizure. An EEG can show evidence of seizure activity even when a person isn�t having a seizure. But an EEG can also be completely normal when a person is not having a seizure.
Imaging scans, such as a CT scan or MRI scan, can also help by providing a clear picture of the brain. These scans allow your doctor to see abnormalities like brain damage or a tumor."
epilepsy,"for epilepsy, how are seizures treated??","Treatments for seizures depend on the cause. By treating the cause of the seizures, you may be able to prevent future seizures from occurring. The treatment for seizures due to epilepsy include:
Medications
Antiepileptic drugs are often the first treatment option for people experiencing multiple seizures. They target the signaling activities in specific brain cells and can effectively control seizures in approximately 70% of cases.
There are several types of antiepileptic drugs. You and your doctor may have to work to find out which is the best medication for treating your condition.
Brain surgery
Doctors may recommend surgical options for treating epilepsy and seizures if medications don�t work.
Surgical procedures to treat epilepsy include:
resective surgery
multiple subpial transection
hemispherectomy
corpus callosotomy
Brain surgery for epilepsy can improve quality of life but does carry a risk of complications. Consult with your doctor to discuss whether surgery is the right option for you.
Nerve stimulation
In addition to brain surgery, surgeons can insert nerve stimulation devices in the body to treat epilepsy.
Vagus nerve stimulation involves placing electrodes around the vagus nerve in your neck and a generator for these electrodes in the upper chest. These devices then stimulate the nerve with electrical signals, which can help manage seizures.
Responsive neurostimulation systems also work by stimulating the brain to manage seizures. Doctors can program these devices to assess and respond to nerve activity associated with seizures, often stopping them.
These less invasive surgical options can help safely reduce seizure frequency and severity.
Doctors may also suggest deep brain stimulation therapy. This is where a surgeon places electrodes onto the thalamus.
The thalamus is a part of the brain that processes signals from almost every sensory system. It regulates consciousness, alertness, and sleep cycles.
Electrical signals from these electrodes help regulate the excitability of certain parts of the brain. This can help reduce the frequency of seizures.
Diet changes
Dietary changes may help people manage epilepsy and reduce seizure frequency long term.
If antiepileptic drugs don�t work, following a ketogenic diet can be an alternative to surgery for some people living with epilepsy.
Multiple studies
have linked the diet to positive outcomes in symptom management. However, the exact reasons why it helps people with epilepsy are not known.
However, the ketogenic diet and its variants can feel restrictive. Following the diet long term may be challenging for some.
Be sure to check in with your doctor before starting a new diet, especially as a mode of treatment."
epilepsy,"for epilepsy, tips for living with epilepsy?","It can be challenging to live with epilepsy. But if you have the right support, it�s possible to live a full and healthy life.
Take prescribed medications
It�s important to continue taking antiepileptic drugs if your doctor prescribes them.
It�s important to regularly check in with your doctor and tell them whether you�re experiencing any side effects of your medications. If you have your seizures under control for long periods, your doctor may recommend a gradual reduction in dosage.
Avoid triggers
Some people may be able to identify specific triggers for their seizures. These can include:
stress
drinking alcohol
lack of sleep
Avoiding these triggers may help you manage
your condition.
Educate friends and family
Teach your friends and family more about epilepsy and how to care for you while a seizure occurs.
This includes taking steps to reduce the risk of injury like cushioning your head, loosening tight clothing, and turning you on your side if vomiting occurs.
Find ways to maintain your current lifestyle
Continue your usual activities if possible, and find ways to work around your epilepsy so you can maintain your lifestyle.
For instance, if you�re no longer allowed to drive because you have seizures, you may decide to move to an area that�s walkable or has good public transportation, or use ride-share services so you can still get around.
Making safety modifications to your place of residence can reduce the risk of injury. This can include covering the corners of low objects, not locking the bathroom door when using it, and using guards on radiators and heaters.
Other tips
Find a good doctor who makes you feel comfortable.
Try relaxation techniques, such as yoga, meditation, tai chi, or deep breathing.
Find an epilepsy support group. You can find a local one by looking online or asking your doctor for recommendations."
epilepsy,"for epilepsy, prevention?","In many instances, a seizure isn�t preventable. But maintaining a healthy lifestyle can give you the best chance at reducing your risk. You can do the following:
Get plenty of sleep.
Eat a balanced diet and drink plenty of fluids.
Exercise regularly.
Engage in stress-reducing techniques.
Don�t take illegal substances.
If you�re on medication for epilepsy or other medical conditions, take them as your doctor recommends."
epilepsy,"for epilepsy, how to help a person with epilepsy, or a person having a seizure?","If you live with someone with epilepsy, there are some things you can do to help them:
Endeavor to learn about their condition.
Make a list of their medications, doctors� appointments, and other important medical information.
Talk with the person about their condition and what role they would like you to play in helping.
If you need help, reach out to their doctor or an epilepsy support group. The Epilepsy Foundation is another helpful resource. However, it�s important to note that the foundation is an advocacy group, and may maintain bias on specific topics.
What to do during a seizure
If someone near you is having a seizure there are a number of things you can do to help them.
Clear the area around a person who�s having a seizure to prevent possible injury. If possible, place them on their side and provide cushioning for their head.
Stay with the person. Call 911 or local emergency services as soon as possible if you experience any of these:
The seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes.
The person doesn�t wake up after the seizure.
The person is experiencing repeat seizures.
The seizure occurs in someone who�s pregnant.
The seizure occurs in someone who has never had a seizure before.
It�s important to remain calm. While there�s no way to stop a seizure once it�s begun, you can provide help. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
recommends the following:
Stay with the person having the seizure until it ends, or until they�re fully awake again.
Check to see whether the person is wearing a medical bracelet.
If the person is wearing glasses or anything around their neck, remove them if possible.
If the person having the seizure is standing, you can prevent them from falling or injuring themselves by holding them in a hug or gently guiding them to the floor.
If the person having the seizure is on the ground, try to position them on their side so that saliva or vomit leaks out of their mouth instead of down their windpipe.
If possible, place something soft under their head.
Don�t try to hold the person down while they�re having a seizure.
Don�t put anything in the person�s mouth.
After the seizure
Once a seizure is over, you should:
check the person for injuries
turn the person on their side, if not already
clear their mouth of vomit or saliva
stay with them until they�re fully awake and alert
provide them with a safe area to rest
not offer them anything to eat or drink until they�re fully conscious"

cardiomyopathy,what is cardiomyopathy? Tell me about cardiomyopathy? What kind of disease is cardiomyopathy? Can you elaborate on cardiomyopathy? What can you tell me about cardiomyopathy? Could you describe what cardiomyopathy is? I�d like to know more about cardiomyopathy. Can you help? What information do you have on cardiomyopathy? Could you provide information on cardiomyopathy?,"Cardiomyopathy is a progressive disease of the myocardium, or heart muscle. In most cases, the heart muscle weakens and is unable to pump blood to the rest of the body as well as it should.
There are many different types of cardiomyopathy, caused by a range of factors, from coronary heart disease to certain drugs. Cardiomyopathy can lead to an irregular heartbeat, heart failure, or other complications.
Medical treatment and follow-up care are important. They can help prevent heart failure or heart damage.
This article will take a closer look at the types of cardiomyopathy, as well as the symptoms, causes, and treatment."
cardiomyopathy,"for cardiomyopathy, what are the types of cardiomyopathy??","Cardiomyopathy generally has four types:
Dilated cardiomyopathy. Also sometimes called �enlarged heart,� dilated cardiomyopathy occurs when your heart muscle enlarges, or dilates, and may be too weak to pump blood efficiently. You can inherit it, or it can be the result of coronary artery disease. It�s the most common type of cardiomyopathy.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is believed to be genetic, occurs when your heart walls thicken and prevent blood from flowing through your heart. This stiffens your heart and increases your risk of electrical problems. Long-term high blood pressure, aging, diabetes, or thyroid disease can also cause acquired types of hypertension-related cardiomyopathy. In some instances, the cause is unknown.
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD). This is a very rare form of cardiomyopathy, but it�s the leading cause of sudden death in young athletes. In this type of genetic cardiomyopathy, fat and extra fibrous tissue replace the muscle of the right ventricle. This causes abnormal heart rhythms and abnormalities in the function of the right ventricle.
Restrictive cardiomyopathy. Restrictive cardiomyopathy occurs when the ventricles stiffen and can�t relax enough to fill up with blood. Heart disease, scarring of the heart, and cardiac amyloid, which frequently occurs after a heart transplant, are thought to be possible causes.
Other types of cardiomyopathy
Most of the following types of cardiomyopathy belong to one of the previous four classifications, but each has unique causes or complications:
Peripartum cardiomyopathy. Peripartum cardiomyopathy occurs during or after pregnancy. This rare type occurs when the heart weakens within 5 months of delivery or within the final month of pregnancy. When it occurs after delivery, it�s sometimes called postpartum cardiomyopathy. This is a form of dilated cardiomyopathy, and it�s a life threatening condition. Having it once increases your risk with other pregnancies.
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy is due to drinking too much alcohol over a long period of time, which can weaken your heart so it can no longer pump blood efficiently. Your heart can also become enlarged. This is a form of dilated cardiomyopathy.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy. Ischemic cardiomyopathy occurs when your heart can no longer pump blood to the rest of your body due to coronary artery disease. Blood vessels to the heart muscle narrow and become blocked. This keeps oxygen from getting to the heart muscle. Ischemic cardiomyopathy is a common cause of heart failure. Alternatively, nonischemic cardiomyopathy is any form that isn�t related to coronary artery disease.
Noncompaction cardiomyopathy. This is also known as spongiform cardiomyopathy. It�s a rare disease present at birth and is caused by abnormal development of the heart muscle in the womb. Diagnosis may occur at any stage of life.
Pediatric cardiomyopathy. When cardiomyopathy affects a child, it�s called pediatric cardiomyopathy.
Idiopathic cardiomyopathy. If you have idiopathic cardiomyopathy, it means the cause is unknown.
Q: Is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy dominant or recessive?
Anonymous
A: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common genetic heart disorder.
It�s inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means that only a single copy of the mutated gene is needed to cause the disorder.
Sarcomere gene mutations are the primary genetic cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Normally, sarcomere genes work to encode proteins that are responsible for helping the heart muscle contract and relax properly. A genetic mutation impairs the gene�s ability to function properly.
More than 2,000 sarcomere mutations have been identified to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, not everyone who has a sarcomere gene mutation will develop this condition.

cardiomyopathy,"for cardiomyopathy, what are the symptoms of cardiomyopathy??","The symptoms of all types of cardiomyopathy tend to be similar. In all cases, the heart can�t adequately pump blood to the tissues and organs of the body. It can result in symptoms such as:
general weakness and fatigue
shortness of breath, particularly during exertion or exercise
lightheadedness or dizziness
chest pain
heart palpitations
fainting spells
high blood pressure
a bloated abdomen
coughing when lying down
edema, or swelling, of your feet, ankles, legs, or other body parts"
cardiomyopathy,"for cardiomyopathy, what causes cardiomyopathy??","According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
, the cause of cardiomyopathy is often unknown. In other cases, the cause can either be inherited or acquired:
�Inherited� means that you�re born with cardiomyopathy due to the genes you inherited from your parents.
�Acquired� means that you developed cardiomyopathy due to a health condition, disease, or some other type of illness during the course of your life, such as:
coronary artery disease
heart tissue damage due to a heart attack
infections in the heart muscle"
cardiomyopathy,"for cardiomyopathy, risk factors for cardiomyopathy?","Cardiomyopathy can affect people of all ages. Major risk factors include:
a family history of cardiomyopathy, sudden cardiac arrest, or heart failure
coronary artery disease
chronic (long-term) high blood pressure
damage to the heart due to a heart attack
infections that cause inflammation of the heart
heart valve disorders
COVID-19 infection
diabetes
obesity
thyroid disease
alcohol use disorder
sarcoidosis
hemochromatosis
amyloidosis
connective tissue disorders
use of cocaine or amphetamines
some types of cancer medications
exposure to toxins, such as poison or heavy metals
According to 2016 research
, HIV and HIV treatments can also increase your risk of cardiomyopathy. HIV can increase your risk of heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy, in particular.
If you have HIV, talk with a doctor about getting regular tests to check your heart�s health. You should also try to follow a heart-healthy diet and exercise program."
cardiomyopathy,"for cardiomyopathy, when to see a doctor?","It�s possible to have cardiomyopathy and not have symptoms. But many people do develop some warning signs that their heart is weakening. If you notice any of these symptoms, it�s important that you contact your doctor as soon as possible:
shortness of breath
new or unusual fatigue
swelling in your abdomen, legs, feet, ankles, or neck
chest pain, especially after physical exertion or large meals
passing out (fainting) during exercise or physical exertion
an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)
If your doctor suspects you have a condition related to your heart, they may refer you to a cardiologist. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart conditions."
cardiomyopathy,"for cardiomyopathy, how is cardiomyopathy diagnosed??","Your doctor or cardiologist will incorporate the results of four components into your diagnosis:
your personal medical history
your family medical history
physical examination
diagnostic tests and procedures
The diagnostic tests and procedures your doctor or cardiologist may use include:
Blood tests. Blood tests can provide information about your heart and also help rule out other conditions.
Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can help your doctor see the size and structure of your heart and lungs and check for any fluid buildup.
Stress test. A stress test gauges your heart function while you exercise.
Electrocardiogram. An electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) is used to assess your heart�s electrical activity over a short period of time.
Holter monitor. A Holter or event monitor can measure your heart�s electrical activity over 24 or 48 hours.
Echocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to create live images of your heart and how it�s beating.
Heart MRI. A heart MRI uses magnets and radio waves to capture images of your heart and coronary blood vessels.
Your doctor may also perform some diagnostic procedures to confirm the diagnosis, especially if you�re planning to have surgery. These procedures may include:
Cardiac catheterization. With cardiac catheterization, a long, thin tube is inserted into an artery or vein and threaded up to your heart so your doctor can evaluate your heart for a number of potential issues, including artery blockages.
Coronary angiography. With coronary angiography, your doctor injects dye into your bloodstream to look at the flow of blood through your arteries and heart.
Myocardial biopsy. A myocardial biopsy is a procedure that involves removing a small part of your heart�s tissue so it can be examined under a microscope."
cardiomyopathy,"for cardiomyopathy, how is cardiomyopathy treated??","Treatment varies depending on how damaged your heart is due to cardiomyopathy and the resulting symptoms.
Some people may not require treatment until symptoms appear. Others who are beginning to struggle with breathlessness or chest pain may need to make some lifestyle changes or take medications.
You can�t reverse or cure cardiomyopathy, but you can manage it with some of the following options:
Heart-healthy lifestyle changes, such as aiming for a moderate weight, trying to quit if you smoke, following a balanced and nutritious diet, managing stress when possible, and getting the right amount of physical activity
Medications, including medications used to treat high blood pressure, prevent water retention, keep the heart beating with a normal rhythm, prevent blood clots, and reduce inflammation
Surgically implanted devices, like pacemakers and defibrillators
Surgery, if symptoms are severe and medications don�t work well, bypass surgery or valve surgery may be an option. A less common procedure is septal myectomy, which involves removing some heart tissue in order to improve blood flow through the heart
Heart transplant, which is considered a last resort
The goal of treatment is to help your heart work as efficiently as possible and to prevent further damage and loss of function."
cardiomyopathy,"for cardiomyopathy, can cardiomyopathy be prevented??","If cardiomyopathy runs in your family, you may not be able to completely prevent it. But, you can take steps to keep your heart healthy and minimize the impact of this condition.
Even if cardiomyopathy isn�t part of your family history, it�s still important to take steps to make sure you don�t develop a heart condition or disease that could put you at an increased risk of cardiomyopathy.
The steps
you can take to help lower your risk of cardiomyopathy include:
Getting regular exercise. Try to limit how much you sit each day, and focus on getting at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week.
Getting enough sleep. Sleep deprivation is linked to an increased risk of heart disease. Try to get at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night.
Eating a heart-healthy diet. Try to limit your intake of sugary, fried, fatty, and processed foods. Focus instead on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, nuts, seeds, and low fat dairy. Also limit your intake of salt (sodium), which can raise your risk of high blood pressure.
Reducing your stress levels. Try to find healthy ways to lower your stress when possible. You may want to consider taking regular brisk walks, doing deep breathing exercises, meditating, doing yoga, listening to music, or talking with a trusted friend.
Quitting smoking, if you smoke. Smoking can negatively affect your entire cardiovascular system, including your heart, blood, and blood vessels.
Managing underlying health conditions. Work closely with your doctor to control and manage any underlying health conditions that may raise your risk of cardiomyopathy."
cardiomyopathy,"for cardiomyopathy, what is the long-term outlook??","Cardiomyopathy can be life threatening and can shorten your life expectancy if severe damage occurs early on. The disease is also progressive, which means it tends to get worse over time, especially if it isn�t treated.
Treatments can prolong your life by slowing the decline of your heart�s condition or by providing technologies to help your heart work more effectively.
If you have cardiomyopathy, it�s important to make lifestyle changes to improve your heart health, such as:
eating a heart-healthy diet
maintaining a moderate weight
quitting smoking
exercising regularly
One of the biggest challenges is sticking with a regular exercise program. Exercise can be very tiring for someone with cardiomyopathy. However, exercise is extremely important for maintaining a moderate weight and prolonging heart function.
It�s important to check with your doctor and engage in a regular exercise program that�s not too taxing but gets you moving every day.
The type of exercise that�s best for you will depend on the type of cardiomyopathy you have. Your doctor can help you put together an exercise routine that�s safe and effective for you. They can also help you understand what signs and symptoms to watch out for while you�re exercising."
cardiomyopathy,"for cardiomyopathy, the bottom line?","Cardiomyopathy is a progressive disease that involves the weakening of the heart muscle. If your heart weakens too much, it will be unable to pump blood properly to the organs and tissues throughout your body.
Cardiomyopathy can be caused by coronary artery disease, a heart attack, or some other underlying health condition. In some cases, it can be genetic, which means you inherited it from your parents. In other instances, the cause is unknown.
There are several types of cardiomyopathy, each with their own cause. The two most common types are dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Common symptoms of cardiomyopathy include shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the feet, ankles, legs, abdomen, or veins of the neck.
If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor as soon as possible. The sooner you can get treatment for this condition, the lower your risk of heart damage and loss of function.

What can you tell me about chronic kidney failure? Could you describe what chronic kidney failure is? I�d like to know more about chronic kidney failure. Can you help? What information do you have on chronic kidney failure? Could you provide information on chronic kidney failure?,Chronic kidney failure occurs when your kidneys are damaged and cannot filter waste from your body effectively. You may experience more symptoms as the condition progresses.
chronic kidney failure,"for chronic kidney failure, what is chronic kidney failure??","Chronic kidney failure is the loss of kidney function over months or years. In advanced stages, dangerous levels of waste and fluids can back up in your body. This condition is also called chronic kidney disease.
Your kidneys filter excess fluids and waste products from your blood. This waste is typically eliminated in your urine."
chronic kidney failure,"for chronic kidney failure, symptoms of chronic kidney failure?","If you�re in the early stages of chronic kidney failure, you may or may not have symptoms.
Some early symptoms of kidney failure can also occur with other illnesses and conditions. This can make diagnosis difficult.
Early symptoms can include:
high blood pressure
swelling in your hands or feet
urinary tract infections
protein in your urine
blood in your urine
If the damage to your kidneys gets worse, you will eventually notice symptoms. Later stage symptoms can include:
difficulty staying alert
cramps and twitches
numbness in your limbs
weakness
fatigue
bad breath
skin that�s darker or lighter than usual
bone pain
excessive thirst
bleeding and bruising easily
insomnia
urinating more or less than usual
hiccups
swollen feet and ankles
missing menstrual periods
shortness of breath
Chronic kidney disease can also lead to other complications. These may include:
pulmonary edema (fluid buildup in your lungs) and fluid buildup in other areas
vitamin D deficiency, which can affect your bone health
nerve damage that can lead to seizures
anemia
cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke
electrolyte imbalance
sexual dysfunction and impotence
uremia
infertility
inability to maintain weight"
chronic kidney failure,"for chronic kidney failure, causes of chronic kidney failure?","Diabetes and high blood pressure can commonly lead
to chronic kidney failure.
Other causes can include:
damage to kidney function
recurring kidney infections
inflammation in your kidneys� filtration system
congenital kidney disease
obstruction of your urinary tract
autoimmune disorders
You may be at a higher risk of chronic kidney failure if you:
smoke cigarettes
have obesity
have diabetes
have heart disease
have high cholesterol
have a family history of kidney disease
are over age 65"
chronic kidney failure,"for chronic kidney failure, diagnosing chronic kidney failure?","If you have high blood pressure, diabetes, or another condition that puts you at higher risk of kidney failure, a doctor will likely routinely monitor your kidney function.
Regular checkups and reporting symptoms can help doctors diagnose chronic kidney failure early.
Physical exam
At your appointment, a doctor will perform a physical exam.
Kidney failure can cause fluids to back up in your lungs or heart. A doctor may examine these organs by listening to them with a stethoscope.
Blood and urine tests
If a doctor thinks you might have chronic kidney failure, they will likely order blood and urine tests.
Blood tests for kidney function measure the levels of electrolytes and waste in your blood. They measure waste products such as. These can include:
Creatinine: Creatinine is a byproduct of muscle metabolism.
Blood urea: Blood urea is left over when your body breaks down proteins.
When your kidneys are working properly, they excrete both substances.
Urine tests can measure your kidney function.
A urine protein test measures how much protein is in your urine. Urine typically contains only trace amounts of protein. An elevated protein level may indicate kidney problems months or even years before other symptoms appear.
Imaging tests
Imaging tests can provide structural details of your kidneys. These can include:
kidney ultrasound
MRI
CT scan
Biopsy
A doctor may also order a biopsy. This can be performed as a needle biopsy or an open biopsy.
A needle biopsy is the most common type of kidney biopsy. During this procedure, a doctor or technician inserts a needle into your kidney. This is considered a minimally invasive procedure.
During an open biopsy, a doctor will use a surgical incision to expose your kidney. This procedure requires strict sterile techniques and general anesthesia.
After the doctor collects a sample of kidney tissue, they will send it to a lab for microscopic examination.
Testing results and follow-up
The results of your examination will help the doctor make a diagnosis. It can also help them determine the cause of your kidney failure.
If you receive a diagnosis of chronic kidney failure, you will likely need regular blood tests. These measure various substances in your body, such as:
calcium
potassium
cholesterol
sodium
magnesium
phosphorous
You may also need ongoing kidney function tests to measure your creatinine and urea levels."
chronic kidney failure,"for chronic kidney failure, treatment of chronic kidney failure?","There is no cure for chronic kidney failure. However, certain measures can slow its progression.
Medication
Medication can help treat the symptoms of chronic kidney failure.
Kidney failure is linked to high blood pressure, so a doctor may prescribe medication to lower your blood pressure. You might also need medications called statins to lower your cholesterol level.
People with chronic kidney failure may also experience anemia. Anemia occurs when your body doesn�t produce enough red blood cells. Treatments for anemia can include:
a supplement to help increase your red blood cell production
iron pills or shots to help your body manufacture blood cells
a blood transfusion to improve your red blood cell health, in some cases
If your kidney problem causes fluid retention, medications called diuretics can help relieve your swelling. This medication makes you urinate frequently.
A doctor may also prescribe medication to support your bone health. This can include:
calcium supplements
vitamin D supplements, as vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption
phosphate binders, as high levels of phosphate can reduce calcium absorption
Antihistamines can help relieve itchy skin and antiemetics can help with nausea.
Diet
A doctor may also recommend certain dietary changes, including reducing your intake of certain nutrients.
These can include
:
Protein: As your body processes protein, it creates waste products. Your kidneys are responsible for filtering this waste. A lower protein diet makes their job easier.
Potassium: When your kidneys are not functioning well, they may not filter potassium properly. In people with chronic kidney failure, high levels of potassium (hyperkalemia) can be life threatening. It can lead to issues with heart function or paralysis. Doctors may recommend a low potassium diet.
Phosphate: Your kidneys may not be able to process phosphate either. Phosphate can also diminish your body�s ability to absorb calcium. High phosphate foods include fish, dairy products, eggs, and meat. You may need to eat less of these.
Salt and sodium: Consuming too much sodium can make it hard for your body to maintain fluid levels. Reading labels may help you manage your intake. Many prepared foods, such as canned soup or fast food, can be high in sodium.
You can work with a dietitian or a doctor to find out how much of these substances you should eat.
You may also need to limit your fluid intake so your kidneys don�t have to work too hard.
People with chronic kidney failure often lose weight. Make sure you�re consuming enough calories from foods approved and recommended by a dietitian.
Lifestyle
Certain lifestyle practices may help slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. These can include:
quitting smoking, if you smoke
keeping up to date on your vaccinations, including your flu shot
discuss supplements and over-the-counter (OTC) medications with a doctor before taking them
If you see other doctors for different conditions, always inform them of your kidney situation.
End stage treatment
If attempts to control your condition through diet and medication fail, you might face end stage kidney disease.
End stage kidney disease, also known as end stage renal disease (ESRD), occurs when your kidneys operate at less than 15%
of their full capacity. At this stage, your kidneys can no longer eliminate waste as fast as you produce it.
There are two treatment options for end stage kidney disease: dialysis and kidney transplant.Doctors typically try to postpone these options as long as possible because both carry serious risks.
Dialysis
Dialysis is a system for filtering waste products and excess fluids out of your blood.
The two main types of dialysis include:
Hemodialysis: In hemodialysis, your blood is filtered outside your body in a machine.
Peritoneal dialysis: In peritoneal dialysis, you fill your abdominal cavity with a special solution via a catheter. The solution absorbs excess fluid and waste before it�s drained from your body.
Because dialysis usually needs to be done several times a week, it�s a big lifestyle change. Dialysis also carries a risk of infection.
Kidney transplant
Kidney transplant is more convenient than dialysis if you can find an appropriate donor kidney. The donor needs to have the same blood type as you.
A kidney from a living sibling or other close relative is usually best. You could also get your kidney from a deceased donor.
However, kidney transplants also carry a large risk of infection because you will need lifelong immunosuppression."
chronic kidney failure,"for chronic kidney failure, long-term outlook for chronic kidney failure?","Some people with chronic kidney failure can live for many years. This can sometimes be accomplished through lifestyle changes and medication. You will need to maintain a kidney-healthy regimen for the rest of your life.
If you reach ESRD, you will need dialysis or a kidney transplant. Without such interventions, the disease is fatal.
The health of your kidneys affects your other organs and systems, too. Possible complications of kidney failure include:
heart and liver failure
damage to your nerves
stroke
fluid buildup in your lungs
infertility
erectile dysfunction
dementia
bone fractures
Children with kidney failure may not achieve growth milestones because their kidneys can�t activate vitamin D. Vitamin D is essential for bone growth.
Kidney failure also poses serious risks to pregnant people and their babies. Pregnant people with kidney failure face a higher incidence of preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a spike in blood pressure that can lead to brain or liver hemorrhage in pregnant people. It can be fatal to the pregnant person and baby."
chronic kidney failure,"for chronic kidney failure, preventing chronic kidney failure?","You may be able to prevent kidney failure with certain lifestyle changes. Here are some general guidelines:
If they consume alcohol, people over 65 should limit themselves to no more than one drink per day. Males who are younger than 65 should stop at two drinks or fewer.
Manage your blood pressure.
If you have diabetes, manage your blood sugar.
If needed, try to maintain a moderate weight. This can mean consuming fewer calories and increasing your activity. A doctor can make provide healthy weight loss guidelines.
OTC pain relievers can cause kidney damage. Follow the directions on the package, only take them as needed, and discuss the use of pain relievers with a doctor if you have any kidney concerns.
If you smoke cigarettes, consider quitting."
chronic kidney failure,"for chronic kidney failure, takeaway?","Chronic kidney failure develops slowly over time. At first, you may not notice symptoms. But symptoms may appear as the disease progresses.
You may be more likely to develop chronic kidney failure if you have certain health conditions, including diabetes and high blood pressure.
Preventive measures and treatment may help slow the progression of kidney failure."

I�d like to know more about carcinoma. Can you help? What information do you have on carcinoma? Could you provide information on carcinoma?,"What is basal cell carcinoma?
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a type of skin cancer that begins in the basal cells. Normal basal cells line the epidermis. They�re the skin cells that replace old cells with new ones. Cancer of the basal cells results in tumors that appear on the skin�s surface. These tumors often look like sores, growths, bumps, scars, or red patches.
While BCC almost never spreads to other places in the body (metastasizes), it can still result in disfigurement. In rare cases, it can spread to other parts of the body. If it does, it can become life-threatening.
BCC is the most common type of skin cancer. Approximately 4 million cases of it are diagnosed in the United States every year."
carcinoma,"for carcinoma, pictures of basal cell carcinoma?","VIEW GALLERY
5"
carcinoma,"for carcinoma, what are the symptoms of basal cell carcinoma??","Almost all BCCs develop on parts of the body frequently exposed to the sun. Tumors can develop on the face, ears, shoulders, neck, scalp, and arms. In very rare cases, tumors develop on areas not often exposed to sunlight.
BCCs are typically painless. The only symptom is the growth or change in the appearance of the skin. There are different types of BCC. Each has a different appearance:
Pigmented BCC: This type appears as a brown, blue, or black lesion, which often has a translucent and raised border.
Superficial BCC: This type takes on the appearance of a reddish patch on the skin, which is often flat and scaly. It continues to grow and often has a raised edge. It typically takes on this appearance when on the back or chest.
Nonulcerative BCC: This type appears as a bump on the skin that is white, skin-colored, or pink. It�s often translucent, with blood vessels underneath that are visible. This is the most common type of BCC. It most commonly appears on the neck, ears, and face. It can rupture, bleed, and scab over.
Morpheaform BCC: This is the least common type of BCC. It typically resembles a scarlike lesion with a white and waxy appearance and no defined border. This type of carcinoma can indicate a particularly invasive form of BCC, which is more likely to be disfiguring.
Basosquamous BCC: This type of carcinoma carries traits of both BCC and squamous cell carcinoma, another type of skin cancer. It is extremely rare, but is more likely to metastasize compared with other types of skin cancer."
carcinoma,"for carcinoma, what causes basal cell carcinoma??","Skin cancers, including BCC, are primarily caused by long-term sun or ultraviolet (UV) light exposure. These cancers can also be caused by intense occasional exposure often resulting in sunburn.
In rarer cases, other factors can cause BCC. These include:
exposure to radiation
exposure to arsenic
complications from scars, infections, vaccinations, tattoos, and burns
chronic inflammatory skin conditions
Once diagnosed with BCC, there is a strong likelihood of recurrence."
carcinoma,"for carcinoma, what are the risk factors of basal cell carcinoma??","There are a number of risk factors that can increase the likelihood of developing BCC. Some of these risk factors include:
having a family history of BCC
having light skin
having skin that freckles or burns easily
having inherited syndromes that cause skin cancer, like disorders of the skin, nervous system, or endocrine glands
having fair skin, red or blonde hair, or light-colored eyes
being a man
There are other, nongenetic risk factors. These include:
age, with increased age correlating with increased risk
chronic sun exposure
severe sunburn, especially during childhood
living in a higher altitude or sunny location
exposure to radiation therapy
exposure to arsenic
taking immunosuppressing drugs, especially after a transplant surgery"
carcinoma,"for carcinoma, how is basal cell carcinoma diagnosed??","The first step in diagnosing BCC will be a visual inspection from a dermatologist. They�ll check your skin head-to-toe to look for any skin growths or discolorations. They�ll also ask about your medical history, including family history of skin cancers.
If your dermatologist finds any discolorations or growths of concern, they�ll take a biopsy of the skin. To do this, they�ll inject a numbing agent into the skin before removing a small sample of the lesion for testing. The biopsy will be viewed under a microscope to look for skin cancer.
Your dermatologist will remove the growth if BCC is found. If you have an aggressive form of BCC, your doctor may take a biopsy of your lymph nodes to check for metastasis."
carcinoma,"for carcinoma, how is basal cell carcinoma treated??","Treatment for basal cell carcinoma involves removing the growth. Your doctor will recommend a treatment depending on the type of BCC you have, the size of the lesion, and the location of the lesion. Treatment options include:
Curettage and electrodessication
In this procedure, the growth is scraped off with a curette. The tumor site is then burned with an electrocautery needle. It is extremely effective, especially on small lesions, though it may not be as effective on aggressive BCCs or high-risk sites. It can leave a round, white scar. This procedure has a 95 percent success rate.
Excisional surgery
Your doctor will remove the tumor and surrounding border of normal skin around it with a scalpel. This procedure requires stitches to close the surgical site. This is often used for more advanced BCCs, which are at risk for affecting the surrounding skin. It may leave a small scar. This procedure has a 95 percent success rate.
Mohs micrographic surgery
Your doctor will remove a thin layer of tissue that contains the tumor. The layer of tissue is frozen and then mapped under a microscope. The doctor will then repeat the procedure on the exact location the cancer was present.
This procedure can save healthy tissue, and has the highest cure rate at about 99 percent. It�s often used for large tumors, or tumors in highly visible areas like the face or neck.
Cryosurgery
Cryosurgery is used for cancers that are thin and don�t extend far into the skin. Your doctor can freeze and kill cancerous cells with liquid nitrogen. This has a risk of nerve damage at the site, which can result in loss of feeling.
No cutting is necessary, though anesthesia may be used. The growth will blister or crust over. Cryosurgery is most often used for BCC and people with bleeding disorders. It has a success rate of between 85 and 90 percent."
carcinoma,"for carcinoma, recovering from treatment?","BCC treatments are often minor and easy to recover from. Many people will experience some pain at the surgery or excision site as it heals.
Scarring is a common effect of BCC treatment. To lessen the appearance of scars, follow the after-treatment instructions your doctor gives you. These instructions will include:
Keep the excision site clean.
Apply over-the-counter ointments like Vaseline and Neosporin multiple times a day to help it heal, and keep it covered with a bandage.
Keep the wound moist. This will help it heal.
There is a high risk of recurrence of BCC. Take precautions to protect your skin from UV exposure."
carcinoma,"for carcinoma, can basal cell carcinoma cause complications??","The most common complication of basal cell carcinoma is recurrence. BCCs commonly recur, even after successful treatment. In some cases, BCC may reappear in the same place. It can also be disfiguring, especially if not treated promptly.
A diagnosis of BCC increases the chance of developing other types of skin cancer. This includes melanoma, which can metastasize and is the most life-threatening form of skin cancer.
Rare, aggressive forms of BCC can invade the body beyond the skin. It can destroy bone, nerves, and muscles. In rare cases it can metastasize to other parts of the body, including key organs, and become life-threatening."
carcinoma,"for carcinoma, is basal cell carcinoma preventable??","Avoiding or reducing your exposure to UV light is the best way to prevent BCC. Avoid direct sunlight during the brightest parts of the day and avoid using tanning beds.
Apply sunscreen regularly, even if you�re only going to be outside for a few minutes. Use a sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher. You can also wear lightweight clothing and hats to protect against sun exposure. The exception to this is infants. Newborns should be kept out of the sun when possible. Don�t apply sunscreen to infants under six months.
Early detection of BCC can reduce scarring caused by the removal of a tumor. Get a skin cancer check annually from a dermatologist or primary doctor. You should also examine your skin head-to-toe on a monthly basis. If you notice any skin changes, make an appointment with a doctor."

Could you provide information on hepatitis C?,"What is acute hepatitis C?
In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 40,000 people
are acutely infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The acute form of this viral infection may produce only brief symptoms, so some people never know they have it. That can lead to the development of a more serious form of this infection."
hepatitis C,"for hepatitis C, what�s the difference between acute and chronic hepatitis c??","Hepatitis C is a contagious disease caused by HCV, which is spread through contact with blood and bodily fluids that contain HCV. This disease damages your liver. There are two types of hepatitis C infection: acute and chronic.
Acute hepatitis C is a short-term viral infection. People with acute hepatitis C carry the infection for a small window of time, often just several months
. Most people with the acute form of hepatitis C will experience illness and mild symptoms such as fatigue and vomiting within the first six months after exposure. In many cases, the disease causes no symptoms at all.
Acute hepatitis C may improve or resolve without treatment. It leads to chronic infection in 75 to 85 percent of cases. The chronic form may cause long-term problems in your liver, including liver damage and liver cancer."
hepatitis C,"for hepatitis C, how is acute hepatitis c transmitted??","HCV is spread through direct contact with blood or certain bodily fluids that contain HCV. It�s safe to engage in the following activities without worry of transmission:
hugging
kissing
holding hands
sharing eating utensils or glasses
Also, the virus is not spread by coughing and sneezing."
hepatitis C,"for hepatitis C, what are the symptoms of acute hepatitis c??","Symptoms don�t always appear immediately. Symptoms may be noticeable within 14 days but may take as long as six months to produce any sign. The average period it takes to show symptoms is six to seven weeks
. However, most people who contract acute hepatitis C never experience any symptoms.
Symptoms of acute hepatitis C range from very mild to severe. They include:
nausea
vomiting
loss of appetite
fever
fatigue
abdominal pain
joint pain
dark urine
light, clay-colored bowel movements
jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and eyes
If your doctor suspects that you have hepatitis C, they will draw blood to check for HCV antibodies. Antibodies are substances your body produces when it�s fighting an infection. If you have them, your doctor may order a second test to confirm that the virus is still present.
If you are positive for the presence of HCV, your doctor may want to check your liver enzyme levels. This lets them know if the disease has affected your liver. Some people with the virus will have normal levels."
hepatitis C,"for hepatitis C, how is acute hepatitis c treated??","Acute hepatitis C is typically monitored and not treated. Treatment during the acute stage doesn�t change the risk that the disease will progress to the chronic form. An acute infection may resolve on its own without treatment. The following treatment may be all that�s necessary:
proper rest
adequate fluids
a healthy diet
Some people may need treatment with prescription medication. Your doctor will be able to work with you about what treatment options may be best for you."
hepatitis C,"for hepatitis C, risk factors?","Those most at risk for acute and chronic hepatitis C are people who use or share contaminated needles. Mothers can transmit HCV to their babies during childbirth, but not through breastfeeding. Other risk factors for transmission of HCV include:
healthcare work, especially work around needles
getting a tattoo or body piercing with unsterile equipment
undergoing hemodialysis
living in a household with someone with HCV
sharing personal hygiene products, such as razors or toothbrushes
engaging in sexual activity with multiple partners without condoms or dental dams
having a blood transfusion or organ transplant before July 1992 or receiving clotting factors before 1987
The most serious long-term risk of acute hepatitis C is developing chronic hepatitis C, which can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. In 75 to 85 percent of those with acute hepatitis C, the disease will progress to the more serious chronic hepatitis C."
hepatitis C,"for hepatitis C, prevention?","Early detection and treatment are the best ways to prevent the more serious form of hepatitis C. There�s no vaccine for hepatitis C, so the best way to prevent it is to avoid any situations in which you could come into contact with another person�s blood.

What information do you have on psychotic disorder? Could you provide information on psychotic disorder?,"The exact cause of psychosis isn�t always clear. It�s important to seek help if you experience hallucinations, delusions, or trouble thinking clearly. Most people recover with treatment, such as therapy and medication.
Psychosis is a combination of symptoms resulting in an impaired relationship with reality. It can be a symptom of serious mental health disorders. People who are experiencing psychosis may have either hallucinations or delusions.
Hallucinations are sensory experiences that occur within the absence of an actual stimulus. For example, a person having an auditory hallucination may hear their mother yelling at them when their mother isn�t around. Or someone having a visual hallucination may see something, like a person in front of them, who isn�t actually there.
The person experiencing psychosis may also have thoughts that are contrary to actual evidence. These thoughts are known as delusions. Some people with psychosis may also experience loss of motivation and social withdrawal.
These experiences can be frightening. They may also cause people who are experiencing psychosis to hurt themselves or others.
It�s important to get medical help right away if you or someone else is experiencing symptoms of psychosis."

feeling paranoid or suspicious of others
withdrawing from friends and loved ones
an influx of strange, new feelings, or no feeling at all
a disinterest in personal grooming
difficulty separating reality from non-reality
trouble communicating

psychotic disorder,"for psychotic disorder, what are delusions and hallucinations??","Delusions and hallucinations are two very different symptoms that are both often experienced by people with psychosis. Delusions and hallucinations seem real to the person who is experiencing them.
Delusions
A delusion is a false belief or impression that is firmly held even though it�s contradicted by reality and what is commonly considered true. There are delusions of paranoia, grandiose delusions, and somatic delusions.
People who are experiencing a delusion of paranoia might think that they are being followed when they�re not, or that secret messages are being sent to them.
Someone with a grandiose delusion will have an exaggerated sense of importance.
Somatic delusion is when a person believes they have a terminal illness, but in reality they�re healthy.
Hallucinations
A hallucination is a sensory perception in the absence of outside stimuli. That means seeing, hearing, feeling, or smelling something that isn�t present.
A person who is hallucinating might see things that don�t exist or hear people talking when they�re alone."

In general, some of the factors involved in psychosis are:
genetics
trauma (such as a death, sexual assault, or living through a war)
substance use (drugs like LSD and amphetamines have been linked
to instances of psychosis in some people)
mental health conditions (like schizophrenia)"
psychotic disorder,"for psychotic disorder, risk factors for developing psychosis?","It�s not currently possible to precisely identify who is likely to develop psychosis. However, research has shown that genetics may play a role.
People are more likely to develop a psychotic disorder if they have a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, who has a psychotic disorder.
Children born with the genetic mutation known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are at risk of developing a psychotic disorder, especially schizophrenia."
psychotic disorder,"for psychotic disorder, types of psychosis?","Some kinds of psychosis are brought on by specific conditions or circumstances.
Brief psychotic disorder
Brief psychotic disorder
, sometimes called brief reactive psychosis, can occur during periods of extreme personal stress like the death of a family member.
Someone experiencing brief reactive psychosis will generally recover in a few days to a few weeks, depending on the source of the stress.
Drug- or alcohol-related psychosis
Psychosis can sometimes be triggered by the use of alcohol or drugs, including stimulants such as
methamphetamine.
Hallucinogenic drugs like LSD often cause users to see things that aren�t really there, but this effect is temporary. Some prescription drugs like steroids and stimulants can also cause symptoms of psychosis.
People who have an alcohol or substance use disorder can experience symptoms of psychosis if they suddenly stop drinking or taking those drugs.
Organic psychosis
A head injury, illness, or infection that affects the brain can cause
symptoms of psychosis."

Schizophrenia
Symptoms of psychosis generally appear in schizophrenia."
psychotic disorder,"for psychotic disorder, how is psychosis diagnosed??","Psychosis is diagnosed through a psychiatric evaluation. That means a doctor will watch the person�s behavior and ask questions about what they�re experiencing.
Medical tests and X-rays may be used to determine whether there is an underlying illness causing the symptoms.
Diagnosing psychosis in children and teenagers
Many of the symptoms of psychosis in adults aren�t symptoms of psychosis in young people. For example, small children often have imaginary friends with whom they talk. This just represents imaginative play, which is completely normal for children.
But if you�re worried about psychosis in a child or adolescent, it�s best to describe their behavior to a doctor."
psychotic disorder,"for psychotic disorder, treatment of psychosis?","Treating psychosis may involve a combination of medications and therapy. Most people will experience an improvement in their symptoms with treatment.
Rapid tranquilization
Sometimes people experiencing psychosis can become agitated and be at risk of hurting themselves or others. In these cases, it may be necessary to calm them down quickly.
This method is called rapid tranquilization
. A doctor or emergency response personnel will administer a fast-acting injection or liquid medication to quickly relax the person.
Medication
Symptoms of psychosis can be managed with medications called antipsychotics. They reduce hallucinations and delusions, and help people think more clearly. The type of antipsychotic a doctor prescribes will depend on the symptoms.
In many cases, people only need to take antipsychotics for a short time until their symptoms are more manageable. Others may need to take them more long term.
Cognitive behavioral therapy
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of mental health therapy. Its goal is to change thinking and behaviors. CBT involves regular meetings with a mental health counselor.
CBT has been shown to be effective in helping people better manage their mental health conditions.
It�s often most helpful for symptoms of psychosis that medications don�t fully address."
psychotic disorder,"for psychotic disorder, getting help for others?","Experiencing psychosis can be extremely frightening, but many people who experience it don�t always talk about it initially.
If you believe someone you know may be experiencing psychosis or may soon experience symptoms, contact their healthcare team right away if they have one. If they don�t, reach out to a local hospital.
If you believe they may be a danger to themselves or others, you can call 911 or take them to the emergency room.
If you feel unsure or nervous about their behavior or what they might do, get a professional involved as soon as you can.

psychotic disorder,"for psychotic disorder, complications and outlook for people with psychosis?","Psychosis doesn�t have many medical complications. However, if left untreated, it can be challenging for people experiencing psychosis to maintain quality of life. This could cause other conditions to go untreated.
Most people who experience psychosis, even severe cases, will recover with the proper treatment, such as therapy and medication."

What can you tell me about bipolar disorder? Could you describe what bipolar disorder is? I�d like to know more about bipolar disorder. Can you help? What information do you have on bipolar disorder? Could you provide information on bipolar disorder?,"Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition marked by large shifts in mood from mania to depression. Although bipolar disorder can be challenging to manage, many effective treatments and strategies are available.
Bipolar disorder isn�t a rare condition. In fact, the National Institute of Mental Health says that 2.8%
of U.S. adults � or about 5 million people � have a bipolar disorder diagnosis.
The condition used to be known as manic depression and bipolar disease.
Key symptoms of bipolar disorder include:
These episodes may last from a few days to several weeks or longer.
If you�re living with bipolar disorder, the following treatment options can help you learn to manage mood episodes, which can improve not only your symptoms but also your overall quality of life."
bipolar disorder,"for bipolar disorder, types of bipolar disorder?","There are three main types of bipolar disorder: bipolar I, bipolar II, and cyclothymia.
Bipolar I
Bipolar I is defined by the appearance of at least one manic episode. You may experience hypomanic episodes, which are less severe than manic episodes, or major depressive periods before and after the manic episode. A person can also go through a long period of stable mood before experiencing either mania or depression.
This type of bipolar disorder affects people of all sexes equally.
Are sex and gender the same thing?
People often use the terms sex and gender interchangeably, but they have different meanings:
�Sex� refers to the physical characteristics that differentiate male, female, and intersex bodies.
�Gender� refers to a person�s identity and how they feel inside. Examples include man, woman, nonbinary, agender, bigender, genderfluid, pangender, and trans. A person�s gender identity may differ from the sex they were assigned at birth.
Was this helpful?
Bipolar II
People with bipolar II experience one major depressive episode that lasts at least 2 weeks. They also have at least 1 hypomanic episode that lasts about 4 days. According to a 2017 review
, this type of bipolar disorder may be more common in females.
Cyclothymia
People with cyclothymia experience some symptoms of hypomania and depression, but not enough to characterize an episode of hypomania or depression.
These episodes also involve symptoms that are shorter and less severe than the episodes associated with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. Most people with this condition experience no mood symptoms for 1 to 2 months
at a time.
Your doctor can explain more about what kind of bipolar disorder you have when discussing your diagnosis.
Some people experience distinct mood symptoms that resemble but don�t align with these three types. If that�s the case for you, you might get a diagnosis of:
other specified bipolar and related disorders
unspecified bipolar and related disorders
Learn more about the types of bipolar disorder."
bipolar disorder,"for bipolar disorder, bipolar disorder symptoms?","To receive a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, you must experience at least one period of mania or hypomania.
These both involve feelings of excitement, impulsivity, and high energy, but hypomania is considered less severe than mania. Mania symptoms can affect your day-to-day life at work or home. Hypomania symptoms typically don�t cause as much disruption, but they can still be distressing.
Some people living with bipolar disorder also experience major depressive episodes or �down� moods.
These three main symptoms � mania, hypomania, and depression � are the main features of bipolar disorder. Different types of bipolar disorder involve different combinations of these symptoms.
Bipolar I symptoms
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5)
, a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder requires the following:
at least one episode of mania that lasts at least 1 week
symptoms that affect daily function
symptoms that don�t relate to another medical or mental health condition or substance use
You could also experience symptoms of psychosis or both mania and depression (known as mixed features). These symptoms can have more impact on your life. If you have them, it�s worth reaching out for professional support as soon as possible.
While you don�t need to experience episodes of hypomania or depression to receive a bipolar I diagnosis, many people with bipolar I do report these symptoms.
Bipolar II symptoms
A diagnosis of bipolar II requires:
at least one episode of hypomania that lasts 4 days or longer
and involves 3 or more symptoms of hypomania
hypomania-related changes in mood and usual function that others can notice, though these may not necessarily affect your daily life
at least one episode of major depression that lasts 2 weeks or longer
at least one episode of major depression involving five or more key depression symptoms that have a significant impact on your day-to-day life
symptoms that don�t relate to another medical or mental health condition or substance use
Bipolar II can also involve symptoms of psychosis, but only during an episode of depression. You could also experience mixed mood episodes, which means you�ll have symptoms of depression and hypomania simultaneously.
With bipolar II, though, you won�t experience mania. If you have a manic episode, you�ll receive a diagnosis of bipolar I.
Cyclothymia symptoms
A diagnosis of cyclothymia requires:
periods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depression symptoms, off and on, over 2 years or longer
(1 year
for children and adolescents)
symptoms that never meet the full criteria for an episode of hypomania or depression
symptoms that are present for at least half of the 2 years and never absent for longer than 2 months at a time
symptoms that don�t relate to another medical or mental health condition or substance use
symptoms that cause significant distress and affect daily life
Fluctuating mood symptoms characterize cyclothymia. These symptoms may be less severe than those of bipolar I or II. Still, they tend to last longer, so you�ll generally have less time when you experience no symptoms.
Hypomania may not have a big impact on your daily life. Depression, on the other hand, often leads to more serious distress and affects day-to-day function, even if your symptoms don�t qualify for a major depressive episode.
If you do experience enough symptoms to meet the criteria for a hypomanic or depressive episode, your diagnosis will likely change to another type of bipolar disorder or major depression, depending on your symptoms."
bipolar disorder,"for bipolar disorder, mania and hypomania?","An episode of mania often involves an emotional high. You might feel excited, impulsive, euphoric, and full of energy. You might also feel jumpy or notice your thoughts seem to race. Some people also experience hallucinations and other symptoms of psychosis.
Manic episodes can involve behavior that�s more impulsive than usual, often because you feel invincible or untouchable. Commonly cited examples of this kind of behavior include:
having sex without using a barrier method
misusing alcohol and drugs
going on spending sprees
But impulsiveness can also show up in plenty of other ways. Maybe you:
quit your job abruptly
take off on a road trip by yourself without telling anyone
make a big investment on a whim
drive much faster than usual, well above the speed limit
participate in extreme sports you wouldn�t ordinarily consider
While there are many reasons why a person might engage in these behaviors, the key to mania is that these are not things you would choose to engage in periods of stable mood.
Hypomania, generally associated with bipolar II disorder, involves many of the same symptoms, though they�re less severe. Unlike mania, hypomania often doesn�t lead
to consequences at work, school, or in your relationships. Episodes of hypomania don�t involve psychosis. They typically won�t last as long as episodes of mania or require inpatient care.
With hypomania, you might feel very productive and energized, but you may not notice other changes in your mood. People who don�t know you well may not, either. Those closest to you, however, will usually pick up on your shifting mood and energy levels."
bipolar disorder,"for bipolar disorder, major depressive episodes?","A �down� change in mood can leave you feeling lethargic, unmotivated, and sad.
Bipolar-related episodes of major depression will involve at least five of these symptoms:
a lasting low mood marked by deep sadness, hopelessness, or feelings of emptiness
loss of energy
a sense of feeling slower than usual or persistent restlessness
lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed
periods of too little or too much sleep
a sense of guilt or worthlessness
trouble concentrating, focusing, and making decisions
thoughts of death, dying, or suicide
changes in appetite or weight
Not everyone with bipolar disorder experiences
major depressive episodes, though many people do. Depending on your type of bipolar disorder, you might experience only a few symptoms of depression but not the full five needed for a major episode.
It�s also worth noting that sometimes, but not always, the euphoria of mania can feel enjoyable. Once you get treatment for mania, the symptom-free mood you experience might feel more like a �down� shift, or a period of depression, than a more typical mood state.
While bipolar disorder can cause a depressed mood, bipolar disorder and depression have one major difference. With bipolar disorder, you might have �up� and �down� mood states. With depression, though, your mood and emotions might remain
�down� until you get treatment.
Discover the differences between bipolar disorder and depression."
bipolar disorder,"for bipolar disorder, bipolar disorder symptoms in women vs. men?","Most research suggests that males and females receive bipolar disorder diagnoses roughly equally
, though some studies suggest it may be more prevalent in females. However, the main symptoms of the disorder may vary, depending on the sex you were assigned at birth and your gender.
Females with bipolar disorder tend to receive diagnoses later in life, often in their 20s or 30s. Sometimes, they might first notice symptoms during pregnancy or after childbirth. They�re also more likely to be diagnosed with bipolar II than bipolar I.
Additionally, females living with bipolar disorder tend to experience:
milder episodes of mania
more depressive episodes than manic episodes
rapid cycling, or four or more episodes
of mania and depression in 1 year
more co-occurring conditions
Females with bipolar disorder may also experience relapse more often, partly due to hormone changes related to menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause. In terms of bipolar disorder, relapse means having a mood episode after not having one for some time.
Get the facts about bipolar disorder in females.
Males with bipolar disorder, on the other hand, may:
get a diagnosis earlier in life
experience less frequent but more severe episodes, especially manic episodes
be more likely to also have a substance use disorder
show more aggression during episodes of mania"
bipolar disorder,"for bipolar disorder, bipolar disorder in historically marginalized groups?","Research
shows that people from historically marginalized groups, particularly those of African ancestry, are frequently misdiagnosed with other conditions like schizophrenia, especially if they exhibit symptoms of psychosis.
While the symptoms of bipolar disorder can vary somewhat from person to person and can depend on the type, there are clear criteria for diagnosis.
Research also suggests 50-75% of people living with bipolar disorder will experience some symptoms of psychosis, but this is stable across all racial and ethnic groups.
Both these factors suggest that bias may play a role in this frequent misdiagnosis.

bipolar disorder,"for bipolar disorder, bipolar disorder in children and teens?","Diagnosing bipolar disorder in children is controversial, largely because children don�t always display the same bipolar disorder symptoms as adults. Their moods and behaviors may also not follow the standards doctors use to diagnose the disorder in adults.
Many bipolar disorder symptoms that occur in children also overlap with symptoms of other conditions that commonly occur in children, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
However, in the last few decades, doctors and mental health professionals have come to recognize the condition in children. A diagnosis can help children get treatment, but reaching a diagnosis may take many weeks or months. It may be worth seeking care from a professional who specializes in treating children with mental health conditions.
Like adults, children with bipolar disorder experience extreme mood shifts. They can appear
very happy and show signs of excitable behavior, or seem very tearful, low, and irritable.
All children experience mood changes, but bipolar disorder causes distinct and noticeable mood symptoms. Mood changes are also usually more extreme than a child�s typical change in mood.
Manic symptoms in children
Symptoms of mania in children can include:
acting very silly and feeling overly happy
talking fast and rapidly changing subjects
having trouble focusing or concentrating
engaging in behaviors that can have harmful effects
having a very short temper that leads quickly to outbursts of anger
having trouble sleeping and not feeling tired after sleep loss
Depressive symptoms in children
With bipolar disorder, symptoms of depressive episodes in children can include:
moping around, acting very sad, or crying frequently
sleeping too much or too little
having little energy for usual activities or showing no signs of interest in anything
complaining about not feeling well, including having frequent headaches or stomachaches
feelings of worthlessness or guilt
eating too little or too much
thoughts of death or suicide
Other possible diagnoses
Some of the behavior issues you notice in your child could suggest other mental health conditions, such as ADHD or depression. It�s also possible for children to have bipolar disorder with another condition.
Your child�s doctor can offer more guidance and support with noting and tracking your child�s behaviors, which can help them find the right diagnosis.
The correct diagnosis can play a major role in finding the most effective treatment for your child. Treatment, of course, can make a big difference in your child�s symptoms, not to mention their quality of life.
Read more about bipolar disorder in children.
Symptoms in teens
Shifting hormones, plus the life changes that naturally happen with puberty, can make teens seem extremely emotional from time to time.
Yet drastic or rapidly fluctuating changes in mood may suggest a more serious condition, such as bipolar disorder, rather than typical teenage development.
A bipolar disorder diagnosis is most common during the late teen and early adult years.
Common symptoms of mania in teenagers include:
being very happy
�acting out� or misbehaving
taking part in behaviors that may have a harmful effect, like substance use
thinking about sex more than usual
becoming overly sexual or sexually active
having trouble sleeping, without signs of fatigue or being tired
having a very short temper
having trouble staying focused or getting distracted easily
Common symptoms of a depressive episode include:
sleeping too much or too little
eating too much or too little
feeling very sad and showing little excitability
withdrawing from activities and friends
thinking or talking about death and suicide
Remember that many of these signs, like experimenting with substances and thinking about sex, aren�t uncommon teenage behaviors. But if they seem part of a larger pattern of shifting moods or start to affect their day-to-day life, they could be a sign of bipolar disorder or another condition.

Natural remedies for bipolar disorder
Some natural remedies might also help with bipolar disorder symptoms.
You�ll always want to check with your doctor or psychiatrist before trying these remedies, though. In some cases, they could interfere with any medications you�re taking.
The following herbs and supplements may help stabilize your mood and reduce symptoms of bipolar disorder when combined with medication and therapy:
Omega-3: Some 2016 research
suggests that taking an omega-3 supplement may help with symptoms of bipolar I. However, a 2021 study found weak support for using the supplement to treat depression symptoms in bipolar disorder.
Rhodiola rosea: A 2013 review
suggests this plant may help with moderate depression, so it could help treat depression associated with bipolar disorder, but this, too, has not been substantiated with newer research.
S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe): SAMe is an amino acid supplement that may help ease
symptoms of major depression and other mood disorders. However, it can induce mania and may interact with other medications.
You should consult with a doctor before trying SAMe or any other herbal or natural remedies to help you manage your bipolar symptoms.

Lifestyle changes
Some studies suggest that lifestyle measures can help reduce the severity
of your bipolar disorder symptoms. These can include the following:
eating a balanced diet
getting at least 150 minutes of exercise a week
managing your weight
getting weekly counseling or therapy
That said, the improvements reported by many of these studies were not significant

bipolar disorder,"for bipolar disorder, causes and risk factors?","Bipolar disorder is a fairly common mental health condition, but experts have yet to determine why some people develop the condition.
Some potential causes of bipolar disorder include:
Genetics
If your parent or sibling has bipolar disorder, you�re more likely to develop the condition. The risk of developing bipolar disorder is 10% to 25%
if one of your parents has the condition.
Keep in mind, though, that most people who have a history of bipolar disorder in their family history don�t develop it.
Learn more about the hereditary aspect of bipolar disorder.
Your brain
Your brain structure may affect your risk of developing bipolar disorder. Irregularities in brain chemistry, or the structure or functions of your brain, may increase this risk.
Environmental factors
It�s not just what�s in your body that can affect your chances of developing bipolar disorder. Outside factors can also play a part. These might include:
extreme stress
traumatic experiences
physical illness
Learn more about the potential causes of bipolar disorder."
bipolar disorder,"for bipolar disorder, can you prevent bipolar disorder??","Once you begin to experience mood episodes, you can take steps to help reduce the severity of those episodes and lower your chances of experiencing additional mood episodes. But you can�t always prevent mood episodes entirely or keep the condition from developing in the first place.
Future research may reveal more about the specific causes of bipolar disorder and give researchers more insight into potential ways of preventing the condition."
bipolar disorder,"for bipolar disorder, common co-occurring conditions?","Some people living with bipolar disorder also have other mental health conditions. A 2019 research review
suggests that anxiety disorders are among the most common.
Other conditions that might occur alongside bipolar disorder include:
substance use disorders
eating disorders
specific phobia
ADHD
Symptoms of these conditions might show up more severely depending on your mood state. Anxiety, for example, tends to happen more commonly with depression, while substance use might be more likely with mania.
If you have bipolar disorder, you may also have a higher chance of developing certain medical conditions, including:
migraine
heart disease
diabetes
thyroid disorders"
bipolar disorder,"for bipolar disorder, tips for coping and support?","If you�ve noticed symptoms of bipolar disorder, a good first step involves reaching out to a doctor or therapist as soon as possible.
Similarly, if a friend or loved one has symptoms, consider encouraging them to connect with a therapist as soon as possible. It never hurts to remind them that they have your understanding and support.
Here�s how you can support a loved one living with bipolar disorder.
Always take suicidal thoughts and behavior seriously
It�s not uncommon to have thoughts of suicide during an episode of depression or a mixed features mood episode.

Living with bipolar disorder
Treatment can help you manage mood episodes and cope with the symptoms they cause.
Creating a care team can help you get the most out of treatment. Your team might involve:
your primary doctor
a psychiatrist who manages your medications
a therapist or counselor who provides talk therapy
other professionals or specialists, such as a sleep specialist, acupuncturist, or massage therapist
a bipolar disorder support group or community of other people also living with bipolar disorder
You may need to try a few treatments before you find one that leads to improvement. Some medications work well for some people but not others. In a similar vein, some people find CBT very helpful, while others may see little improvement.
It�s always best to be open with your care team about what works and what doesn�t. If something doesn�t help or makes you feel even worse, don�t hold back from letting them know. Your mental health matters and your care team should always support you in finding the most helpful approach.
A little self-compassion can go a long way, too. Remember that bipolar disorder, like any other mental health condition, didn�t happen by choice. It�s not caused by anything you did or didn�t do.
It�s OK (and pretty common) to feel frustrated when treatment doesn�t seem to work. Try to have patience and treat yourself kindly as you explore new approaches.
Bipolar disorder and relationships
Bipolar disorder can affect your relationships. But these effects might appear most clearly in your closest relationships, like those with family members and romantic partners.
When it comes to managing a relationship while living with bipolar disorder, honesty can always help. Being open about your condition can help your partner better understand your symptoms and how they can offer support.
You might consider starting with a few basic details, including:
how long you�ve had the condition
how episodes of depression usually affect you
how episodes of mania usually affect you
your treatment approach, including therapy, medication, and coping strategies
anything they can do to help

I�d like to know more about obesity. Can you help? What information do you have on obesity? Could you provide information on obesity?,"Obesity is a long-term (chronic) health condition that progresses over time. Obesity is defined by excess body fat (adipose tissue) that may impair health.
Body mass index (BMI) is a calculation that takes a person�s weight and height into account to measure body size. Doctors typically use it as a screening tool for obesity.
In adults, obesity is often defined as having a BMI of 30 or more
, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Obesity is associated with a higher risk of developing serious diseases, including:
While BMI tends to relate to the level of body fat, it has some limitations as a measurement.
According to the CDC
, �Factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, and muscle mass can influence the relationship between BMI and body fat. Also, BMI doesn�t distinguish between excess fat, muscle, or bone mass, nor does it provide any indication of the distribution of fat among individuals.�
Despite these limitations, BMI continues to be widely used as a way to measure body size. This is because it�s less expensive than other methods.
It�s worth noting that the effects of weight discrimination can also contribute to negative health effects.
Obesity is common. The CDC estimates that 41.9%
of people in the United States had obesity from 2017 to March 2020.
Keep reading to learn more about obesity causes, risk factors, and treatment.
You�ll notice that the language used to share stats and other data points is pretty binary, fluctuating between the use of �men� and �women.�
Although we typically avoid language like this, specificity is key when reporting on research participants and clinical findings.
Unfortunately, the studies and surveys referenced in this article didn�t report data on, or include, participants who were transgender, nonbinary, gender nonconforming, genderqueer, agender, or genderless."
obesity,"for obesity, what are the symptoms of obesity??","There are no specific symptoms associated with obesity. A doctor may diagnose obesity based on the following factors:
excess amounts of abdominal (visceral) fat that are higher than the amounts of body fat in other areas
a waist circumference of greater than 40 inches for men or 35 inches for women
a BMI over 30"
obesity,"for obesity, how is obesity classified??","The following classes
are used for adults who are at least 20 years old:
BMI Class
18.5 or under underweight
18.5 to <25 �normal� weight
25 to <30 overweight
30 to <35 class 1 obesity
35 to <40 class 2 obesity
40 or over class 3 obesity (also known as morbid, extreme, or severe obesity)
What is childhood obesity?
For a doctor to diagnose obesity in a child over 2 years old or a teen, their BMI has to be at or above the 95th percentile
. A BMI at or above the 95th percentile is higher than the BMI of 95% of people with the same age and sex assigned at birth.
Percentile range of BMI Class
>5% underweight
5% to <85% �normal� weight
85% to <95% overweight
95% or over obesity
From 2015 to 2016, 18.5%
(or about 13.7 million) of U.S. youth between 2 and 19 years old were considered to have clinical obesity."
obesity,"for obesity, what causes obesity??","Taking in more calories than you burn in daily activity and exercise � on a long-term basis � can lead to obesity. Over time, these extra calories add up and cause weight gain.
But it�s not always just about calories in and calories out or having a sedentary lifestyle. While those are indeed causes of obesity, some causes you can�t control.
Common specific causes of obesity include:
genetics, which can affect how your body processes food into energy and how fat is stored
growing older, which can lead to less muscle mass and a slower metabolic rate, making it easier to gain weight
not sleeping enough, which can lead to hormonal changes that make you feel hungrier and crave certain high calorie foods
high stress, which may trigger the production of hormones that cause you to eat more and store more fat
pregnancy, as weight gained during pregnancy may be difficult to lose and might eventually lead to obesity
Certain health conditions can also lead to weight gain, which may lead to obesity. These include:
metabolic syndrome, a group of risk factors that include high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high levels of triglycerides, low levels of HDL cholesterol, and excess fat around your waist that raise your chance of developing certain serious health conditions
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition that causes an imbalance of hormones called androgens
Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare condition present at birth that causes excessive hunger
Cushing syndrome, a condition caused by having high levels of cortisol (the stress hormone) in your system
hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn�t produce enough of certain important hormones
osteoarthritis (OA) and other conditions that cause pain that may lead to reduced activity

obesity,"for obesity, who is at risk of obesity??","A complex mix of factors can increase a person�s risk of obesity.
Genetics
Some people have genes that make it more likely for them to gain weight and body fat.
Environment and community
Your environment at home, at school, and in your community can all influence how and what you eat, as well as how active you are.
You may be at a higher risk of developing obesity if you:
live in a neighborhood with limited nutritious food options or with many
high calorie food options, like fast-food restaurants
haven�t learned to cook balanced meals
think you can�t afford more nutritious foods
haven�t found
a good place to play, walk, or exercise in your neighborhood
Psychological and other factors
Depression can sometimes lead to weight gain, as some people may turn to food for emotional comfort.
Having disturbed sleeping patterns can make you eat more
during the day, especially foods high in fat and carbohydrates.
If you smoke, quitting smoking is beneficial to your health, but quitting may lead to weight gain too. In some people, it may lead to excessive
weight gain. For that reason, it�s important to focus on diet and exercise while you�re quitting, at least after the initial withdrawal period.
Medications
Certain medications can also raise your risk of weight gain. These medications can include:
corticosteroids, which may treat autoimmune disease
antidepressants
antipsychotics
beta-blockers, which may treat high blood pressure"
obesity,"for obesity, how is obesity diagnosed??","BMI provides a rough calculation of a person�s weight in relation to their height.
Other more accurate measures of body fat and where body fat is located include:
skinfold thickness tests
waist-to-hip comparisons
dual energy radiographic absorptiometry (DEXA) scans
other screening tests, such as ultrasounds, CT scans, and MRI scans
A doctor may also order certain tests to help diagnose obesity-related health risks. These may include:
blood tests to examine cholesterol and glucose levels
liver function tests
diabetes screening
thyroid tests
heart tests, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)
A measurement of the fat around your waist is also a good predictor of your risk of developing obesity-related diseases."
obesity,"for obesity, what are the complications of obesity??","Obesity can lead to more than weight gain.
Having a high ratio of body fat to muscle puts strain on your bones as well as your internal organs. It also increases inflammation in the body, which may be a risk factor for cancer. Obesity is also a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes.
Researchers have linked obesity to many health complications, some of which can be life threatening if not treated:
type 2 diabetes
heart disease
high blood pressure
certain cancers (breast, colon, and endometrial)
stroke
gallbladder disease
fatty liver disease
high cholesterol
sleep apnea and other breathing problems
arthritis
infertility"
obesity,"for obesity, how is obesity treated??","If you have obesity and would like to lose weight but have been unable to do so on your own, medical help is available. Start with a primary care physician, who may be able to refer you to a weight specialist in your area.
A doctor may also want to work with you as part of a team helping you lose weight. That team might include a dietitian, therapist, or other healthcare staff.
The doctor will work with you on making needed lifestyle changes. Sometimes, they may recommend medications or weight loss surgery as well. Learn more about treatment for obesity.
Doctors typically recommend lifestyle and behavioral changes to help children with obesity lose weight. In some cases, doctors may prescribe
medication."
obesity,"for obesity, which lifestyle and behavioral changes can help with weight loss??","A healthcare team can recommend food choices and help develop a nutritious eating plan that works for you. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases suggests
that an eating plan that you can stick to long-term may help you lose weight and maintain a moderate weight.
A structured exercise program and increased daily activity � between 150 and 300 minutes
a week � will help build up your strength, endurance, and metabolism.
Counseling or support groups may also identify triggers and help you cope with issues relating to:
anxiety
depression
emotional eating"
obesity,"for obesity, which medications are prescribed for weight loss??","A doctor may also prescribe certain prescription weight loss medications in addition to eating and exercise plans.
Doctors may prescribe medications if other methods of weight loss haven�t worked and if you have a BMI of 27 or more in addition to obesity-related health issues.
Prescription weight loss medications either prevent the absorption of fat or suppress appetite. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the following medications for short-term use (up to 12 weeks
):
phentermine/topiramate (Qsymia)
naltrexone/bupropion (Contrave)
liraglutide (Saxenda)
semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy, Rybelsus)
orlistat (Alli, Xenical), the only one that�s FDA-approved for use in children 12 years old and older
These drugs may have unpleasant side effects for some people but may have more serious side effects for others. For example, orlistat can lead to the unpleasant side effects of oily and frequent bowel movements, bowel urgency, and gas. But liraglutide and semaglutide may increase the risk of thyroid cancer for people with a personal or family history.
It�s important to inform the prescribing doctor about your medical history before beginning any of these medications. The doctor will typically monitor you closely to manage side effects and reduce your risks."
obesity,"for obesity, what are the types of weight loss surgery??","Weight loss surgery is commonly called bariatric surgery.
This type of surgery limits how much food you can comfortably eat or prevents your body from absorbing food and calories. Sometimes it can do both.
Weight loss surgery isn�t a quick fix. It�s a major surgery and can have serious risks. Afterward, people who undergo surgery will need to change how they eat and how much they eat, or they risk getting sick.
However, nonsurgical options aren�t always effective at helping people with obesity lose weight and reduce their risk of comorbidities.
Types of weight loss surgery include:
Gastric bypass surgery: In this procedure, a surgeon creates a small pouch at the top of your stomach that connects directly to your small intestine. Food and liquids go through the pouch and into the intestine, bypassing most of the stomach. It�s also known as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery.
Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB): LAGB separates your stomach into two pouches using a band.
Gastric sleeve surgery: This procedure removes part of your stomach.
Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch: This procedure removes most of your stomach.
Candidates for surgery
For decades, experts recommended that adult candidates for weight loss surgery have a BMI of at least 35 (classes 2 and 3).
However, in 2018 guidelines, the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) endorsed weight loss surgery for adults with BMIs of 30 up to 35 (class 1) who:
have related comorbidities, especially type 2 diabetes
haven�t seen long-term results from nonsurgical treatments, such as eating and lifestyle changes
For individuals with class 1 obesity, surgery is most effective for those between the ages of 18 and 65 years.
Some people may have to lose weight before surgery can be approved. Additionally, they�ll normally undergo counseling to ensure that they�re both emotionally prepared for the surgery and the lifestyle changes that it�ll require.
Only a few surgical centers in the United States perform these types of procedures on children under 18 years old."
obesity,"for obesity, how can you prevent obesity??","Due to a dramatic increase in obesity and obesity-related diseases, communities, states, and the federal government are putting an emphasis on healthier food choices and activities to help prevent obesity and treat people with overweight and obesity.
On a personal level, you can help prevent weight gain and obesity by:
getting regular moderate exercise like walking, swimming, or biking for 20 to 30 minutes every day
eating a balanced, heart-healthy diet composed of nutritious foods, like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein
eating high calorie foods and those high in saturated and trans fats in moderation"
obesity,"for obesity, takeaway?","Obesity is a chronic medical condition caused by excess visceral fat. It may raise your risk of developing multiple health conditions, including heart disease and diabetes.

ischemia,what is ischemia? Tell me about ischemia? What kind of disease is ischemia? Can you elaborate on ischemia? What can you tell me about ischemia? Could you describe what ischemia is? I�d like to know more about ischemia. Can you help? What information do you have on ischemia? Could you provide information on ischemia?,"Ischemic stroke is one of three types of stroke. It is caused by a blockage in an artery that supplies blood to the brain. If circulation isn�t restored quickly, brain damage can be permanent.
Ischemic stroke is also called brain ischemia and cerebral ischemia. The blockage caused by this stroke reduces the blood flow and oxygen to the brain, leading to damage or death of brain cells. Approximately 87 percent of all strokes are ischemic strokes.
Another type of major stroke is hemorrhagic stroke, in which a blood vessel in the brain ruptures and causes bleeding. The bleeding compresses brain tissue, damaging or killing it.
The third type of stroke is transient ischemic attack (TIA), also known as a ministroke. This type of stroke is caused by a temporary blockage or decreased blood flow to the brain. Symptoms usually disappear on their own."
ischemia,"for ischemia, what are the symptoms??","Specific symptoms of an ischemic stroke depend on what region of the brain is affected. Certain symptoms are common across most ischemic stroke, including:
vision problems, such as blindness in one eye or double vision
weakness or paralysis in your limbs, which may be on one or both sides, depending on the affected artery
dizziness and vertigo
confusion
loss of coordination
drooping of face on one side
Once symptoms start, it�s crucial to get treatment as quickly as possible. This makes it less likely that damage becomes permanent. If you think someone is having a stroke, evaluate them using FAST:
Face. Is one side of their face drooping and hard to move?
Arms. If they raise their arms, does one arm drift downward, or do they have significant difficulty raising their arm?
Speech. Is their speech slurred or otherwise strange?
Time. If the answer to any of these questions is yes, it�s time to call your local emergency services.
Even though TIA lasts for a brief period and usually resolves on its own, it also requires a doctor. This can be a warning sign of a full-blown ischemic stroke."
ischemia,"for ischemia, what causes ischemic stroke??","Ischemic stroke occurs when an artery that supplies blood to the brain is blocked by a blood clot or fatty buildup, called plaque. This blockage can appear at the neck or in the skull.
Clots usually start in the heart and travel through the circulatory system. A clot can break up on its own or become lodged in an artery. When it blocks a brain artery, the brain doesn�t get enough blood or oxygen, and cells start to die.
Ischemic stroke caused by a fatty buildup happens when plaque breaks off from an artery and travels to the brain. Plaque can also build up in the arteries that supply blood to the brain and narrow those arteries enough to cause ischemic stroke.
Global ischemia, which is a more severe type of ischemic stroke, happens when the flow of oxygen to the brain is greatly reduced or completely stopped. This is usually caused by a heart attack, but it can also be caused by other conditions or events, such as carbon monoxide poisoning."
ischemia,"for ischemia, what are the risk factors??","Circulatory conditions are the main risk factor for ischemic stroke. That�s because they increase your risk for clots or fatty deposits. These conditions include:
high blood pressure
atherosclerosis
high cholesterol
atrial fibrillation
prior heart attack
sickle cell anemia
clotting disorders
congenital heart defects
Other risk factors include:
diabetes
smoking
being overweight, especially if you have a lot of abdominal fat
heavy alcohol misuse
use of certain drugs, such as cocaine or methamphetamines
Ischemic stroke is also more common in people who have a family history of stroke or who�ve had past strokes. Men are more likely than women to have ischemic stroke, while blacks have a higher risk than other races or ethnic groups. Risk also increases with age."
ischemia,"for ischemia, how is it diagnosed??","A doctor can usually use a physical exam and family history to diagnose ischemic stroke. Based on your symptoms, they can also get an idea of where the blockage is located.
If you have symptoms such as confusion and slurred speech, your doctor might perform a blood sugar test. That�s because confusion and slurred speech are also symptoms of severe low blood sugar. Learn more about the effects of low blood sugar on the body.
A cranial CT scan can also help distinguish ischemic stroke from other issues that cause brain tissue death, such as a hemorrhage or a brain tumor.
Once your doctor has diagnosed ischemic stroke, they�ll try to figure out when it started and what the root cause is. An MRI is the best way determine when the ischemic stroke started. Tests used to determine a root cause might include:
an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) to test for abnormal heart rhythms
echocardiography to check your heart for clots or abnormalities
an angiography to see which arteries are blocked and how severe the blockage is
blood tests for cholesterol and clotting problems"
ischemia,"for ischemia, what complications are associated with ischemic stroke??","If ischemic stroke isn�t treated promptly, it can lead to brain damage or death."
ischemia,"for ischemia, how is ischemic stroke treated??","The first goal of treatment is to restore breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure to normal. If necessary, your doctor will then try to reduce pressure in the brain with medication.
The main treatment for ischemic stroke is intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which breaks up clots. 2018 guidelines
from the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Stroke Association (ASA) state that tPA is most effective when it�s given within four and a half hours from the start of a stroke. It can�t be given more than five hours after the start of the stroke. Because tPA can result in bleeding, you can�t take it if you have a history of:
hemorrhagic stroke
bleeding in the brain
recent major surgery or head injury
It also can�t be used by anyone taking anticoagulants.
If tPA doesn�t work, clots can be removed through surgery. A mechanical clot removal can be performed up to 24 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms.
Long-term treatments include aspirin (Bayer) or an anticoagulant to prevent further clots.
If ischemic stroke is caused by a condition such as high blood pressure or atherosclerosis, you�ll need to receive treatment for those conditions. For example, your doctor may recommend a stent to open an artery narrowed by plaque or statins to lower blood pressure.
After ischemic stroke, you�ll have to stay in the hospital for observation for at least a few days. If the stroke caused paralysis or severe weakness, you may also need rehabilitation afterward to regain function."
ischemia,"for ischemia, what does recovery from ischemic stroke entail??","Rehabilitation is often necessary to regain motor skills and coordination. Occupational, physical, and speech therapy might also be useful to help regain other lost function. Younger people and people who start improving quickly are likely to recover more function.
If any issues are still present after a year, they�ll likely be permanent.
Having one ischemic stroke puts you at a higher risk for having another. Taking steps to reduce your risk, such as quitting smoking, are an important part of long-term recovery. Learn more about stroke recovery."
ischemia,"for ischemia, what�s the outlook??","Ischemic stroke is a serious condition and requires prompt treatment. However, with the correct treatment, most people with ischemic stroke can recover or maintain enough function to take care of their basic needs. Knowing the signs of ischemic stroke can help save your life or the life of someone else."
cirrhosis,what is cirrhosis? Tell me about cirrhosis? What kind of disease is cirrhosis? Can you elaborate on cirrhosis? What can you tell me about cirrhosis? Could you describe what cirrhosis is? I�d like to know more about cirrhosis. Can you help? What information do you have on cirrhosis? Could you provide information on cirrhosis?,"Cirrhosis is the severe scarring or fibrosis of the liver. It happens in the late stage of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and other conditions that involve liver damage.
The scarring that occurs with cirrhosis is usually irreversible, but treatment can help manage it. Apart from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) other causes
include hepatitis, long-term alcohol use, and primary sclerosing cholangitis.
According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), about 1 in 400 adults
are living with cirrhosis in the United States. It�s more likely to affect men than women."
cirrhosis,"for cirrhosis, cirrhosis symptoms?","Illustrated by Jason Hoffman
Many times, there aren�t noticeable symptoms of cirrhosis until the condition has progressed.
Symptoms begin to occur because scarring on the liver has reached the point where the organ is limited in its ability to:
purify the blood
break down toxins
produce clotting proteins
help with the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins
Some of the noticeable symptoms of cirrhosis include
:
decreased appetite
fatigue
unintentional weight loss
mild pain on the upper right side of your abdomen
nausea
vomiting
enlarged or swollen veins (varices or varicose veins)
More serious symptoms include:
yellow discoloration of your skin and eyes (jaundice)
confusion and difficulty thinking clearly
bruising or bleeding easily
very itchy skin
urine that looks darker than usual
abdominal swelling (ascites)
swelling of your legs (edema)
The stages of cirrhosis
Symptoms of cirrhosis fall into two technical stages: compensated cirrhosis and decompensated cirrhosis.
If caught early enough and treated, it�s possible to reverse from the decompensated to compensated stage.
Compensated cirrhosis. This is the asymptomatic (showing no symptoms) stage. There may still be scarring on the liver, but it has not progressed enough to cause many, or any, symptoms.
Decompensated cirrhosis. This is the stage where most of the symptoms like jaundice or ascites occur. This is a very serious stage. In some situations, if you�re able to manage the reason cirrhosis started in the first place (e.g., heavy drinking), you may be able to reverse your diagnosis back to compensated."
cirrhosis,"for cirrhosis, common causes of cirrhosis?","There are many different causes of liver cirrhosis. Two of the most common causes of cirrhosis in the United States are chronic hepatitis infections and chronic alcohol misuse.
Alcohol
According to a meta-analysis of studies from 2019
, the risk of liver cirrhosis increases at any level of alcohol consumption for women, which means even a moderate drinker may be at some risk. For men, the risk of cirrhosis increases when an individual has more than one drink a day.
However, every person is different, and enjoying a glass of wine with dinner most nights does not mean you�ll get cirrhosis of the liver. Usually, cirrhosis caused by alcohol is the result of regularly drinking in excess over the course of many years.
There are also several other health factors that play into the development of this condition.
Hepatitis
Hepatitis C is a viral infection that can lead to inflammation and damage to the liver. Individuals who are at risk of getting this type of viral hepatitis include those who:
use illegal injected drugs
engage in sex without a condom or other barrier method
are on kidney dialysis
Hepatitis B is another viral form of hepatitis, but it tends to be less common in the United States and more common
in:
Asia
Africa
South America
Eastern Europe
parts of the Middle East
If left untreated, both of these forms of hepatitis can cause cirrhosis of the liver.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition that causes fat to build up in the liver, but it�s not associated with heavy alcohol use.
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a more severe form of NAFLD, causes liver damage and inflammation in addition to fat buildup. If NASH is not managed, it can lead to cirrhosis.
Other causes
Other causes of cirrhosis include:
Hepatitis D. Hepatitis D is often seen in people who already have hepatitis B.
Autoimmune hepatitis. Autoimmune hepatitis causes inflammation that can lead to cirrhosis.
Damage to the bile ducts. These ducts function to drain bile. One example of a condition is primary biliary cholangitis.
Disorders that affect the body�s ability to handle iron and copper. Two examples are hemochromatosis and Wilson�s disease.
Medication. This includes prescription and over-the-counter drugs like acetaminophen, some antibiotics, and some antidepressants."
cirrhosis,"for cirrhosis, how cirrhosis is diagnosed?","A diagnosis of cirrhosis begins with a detailed history and physical exam. Your doctor will take a complete medical history.
It�s important to be as honest as possible about long-term alcohol misuse, exposure to hepatitis C, family history of autoimmune diseases, or other risk factors.
The physical exam will look for signs such as:
skin or eyes that appear more yellowed in color
reddened palms
hand tremors
an enlarged liver or spleen
decreased alertness
Tests can reveal how damaged the liver has become. Some of the tests used for evaluation of cirrhosis are:
a complete blood count to look for anemia
coagulation blood tests to see how quickly blood clots
albumin tests to check for a protein produced in the liver
liver function tests
alpha fetoprotein, a liver cancer screening
Additional tests that can evaluate the liver include:
an upper endoscopy to see if esophageal varices are present
an ultrasound scan of the liver
an MRI of the abdomen
a CT scan of the abdomen
a liver biopsy, which is the most conclusive test for cirrhosis"
cirrhosis,"for cirrhosis, complications from cirrhosis?","If your blood is unable to pass through your liver, it creates a backup through other veins such as those in the esophagus. This backup is called esophageal varices.
These veins are not built to handle high pressure and begin to bulge from the extra blood flow.
Other complications from cirrhosis include:
bacterial infections, like a urinary tract infection (UTI)
bleeding due to decreased clotting proteins
sensitivity to medications (the liver processes medications in the body)
malnutrition
kidney failure
liver cancer
hepatic encephalopathy, which is confusion due to the effects of blood toxins on the brain
gallstones (interference with bile flow can cause bile to harden and form stones)
splenomegaly, which is an enlarged spleen"
cirrhosis,"for cirrhosis, treatment for cirrhosis?","Treatment for cirrhosis varies based on what caused it, what symptoms you are experiencing, and how far the disorder has progressed. Treatments include medications, lifestyle changes, and surgery.
Medications
Depending on the cause of cirrhosis, your doctor may recommend certain medications, such as beta-blockers or nitrates (for portal hypertension). They may also recommend antibiotics or medications to treat hepatitis.
Lifestyle changes
If your cirrhosis is a result of alcohol consumption, your doctor will most likely advise you to stop drinking.
They may also recommend that you lose weight if they consider it medically necessary.
If you are dealing with ascites, a low sodium diet may also be recommended.
Surgery
If cirrhosis has progressed to the point where treatment isn�t enough, one of the last options is a liver transplant."
cirrhosis,"for cirrhosis, preventing cirrhosis?","Practicing sex with a barrier method can reduce the risk of getting hepatitis B or C.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
recommends that all infants and at-risk adults, such as healthcare professionals and rescue personnel, be vaccinated against hepatitis B.
Limiting alcohol intake or avoiding alcohol, eating a balanced diet, and getting adequate exercise can help prevent or slow cirrhosis. Other prevention methods include:
avoiding illegal drugs
talking with your doctor about any medications you take and always taking the appropriate amount
getting screened for heptitis if you believe you may be at risk for it

cirrhosis,"for cirrhosis, outlook?","Cirrhosis of the liver is a severe stage of liver disease and can be brought about in a variety of ways, such as from chronic misuse of alcohol, an unmanaged hepatitis infection, or untreated NAFLD.
The liver is an important organ, and once it begins to scar due to liver disease, the damage can�t be reversed � only managed with treatment. If left untreated, the damage can become so severe that the liver can no longer function properly.
While not every case of cirrhosis can be avoided, there are ways to prevent it.
Pursuing a lifestyle that includes a nutritious diet, physical activity, moderate to limited alcohol intake, and regular physical appointments with a doctor are all ways to keep your liver in great shape.

benign prostatic hypertrophy,"for benign prostatic hypertrophy, about the prostate?","The prostate is a small, muscular gland in the male reproductive system. Your prostate surrounds your urethra and makes most of the fluid in your semen. The muscular action of the prostate helps propel the fluid and semen through your penis during sexual climax.
In many men, the prostate can become enlarged. Sometimes it leads to symptoms and, over time, other complications. However, there are treatments."
benign prostatic hypertrophy,"for benign prostatic hypertrophy, what is bph??","Enlargement of the prostate is called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It occurs when the cells of the prostate gland begin to multiply. These additional cells cause your prostate gland to swell, which squeezes the urethra and limits the flow of urine.
BPH isn�t the same as prostate cancer and doesn�t increase your risk for cancer. However, it can cause symptoms that can affect your quality of life.
BPH is common in men over 50."
benign prostatic hypertrophy,"for benign prostatic hypertrophy, bph causes?","BPH is considered a normal condition of aging. Although the exact cause is unknown, changes in male sex hormones that come with aging may be a factor.
Any family history of prostate problems or any abnormalities with your testicles may raise your risk for BPH. Men who�ve had their testicles removed at a young age don�t develop BPH."
benign prostatic hypertrophy,"for benign prostatic hypertrophy, bph symptoms?","The symptoms of BPH are often very mild at first, but they become more serious if they aren�t treated. Common symptoms include:
incomplete bladder emptying
nocturia, which is the need to urinate two or more times per night
dribbling at the end of your urinary stream
incontinence, or leakage of urine
straining when urinating
a weak urinary stream
a sudden urge to urinate
a slowed or delayed urinary stream
painful urination
blood in the urine
Talk with your doctor if you have any of these symptoms. They�re treatable, and treating them often can help prevent complications."
benign prostatic hypertrophy,"for benign prostatic hypertrophy, bph diagnosis?","When checking you for BPH, your doctor will usually begin by doing a physical exam and asking you about your medical history. The physical exam includes a rectal examination that allows the doctor to estimate the size and shape of your prostate. Other tests can include:
Urinalysis. Your urine is checked for blood and bacteria.
Urodynamic test. Your bladder is filled with liquid via a catheter to measure your bladder�s pressure during urination.
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. This blood test checks for cancer of the prostate.
Post-void residual. This tests the amount of urine left in your bladder after urination.
Cystoscopy. This is the examination of your urethra and bladder with a tiny lighted scope that�s inserted into your urethra
Your doctor may also ask about medications you�re taking that might be affecting your urinary system, such as:
antidepressants
diuretics
antihistamines
sedatives
Your doctor can make any necessary medication adjustments. Don�t attempt to adjust your medications or doses yourself.
Let your doctor know if you�ve taken self-care measures for your symptoms for at least 2 months without noticing any improvement."
benign prostatic hypertrophy,"for benign prostatic hypertrophy, bph treatment?","Treatment of BPH can begin with self-care and lifestyle adjustments. If symptoms don�t subside, medication or surgery may be recommended. Your age and general health will also influence the prescribed treatment.
Learn more about BPH treatment."
benign prostatic hypertrophy,"for benign prostatic hypertrophy, bph natural treatment?","Natural treatment can include specific actions or lifestyle changes that you can make to help relieve your symptoms of BPH. These include:
urinating as soon as you feel the urge
going to the bathroom to urinate, even when you don�t feel the urge
avoiding over-the-counter decongestants or antihistamine medications, which can make it harder for the bladder to empty
avoiding alcohol and caffeine, especially in the hours after dinner
reducing your stress level, as nervousness can increase the frequency of urination
exercising regularly, as a lack of exercise can aggravate your symptoms
learning and practicing Kegel exercises to strengthen your pelvic muscles
keeping warm, since being cold can make symptoms worse
Some people also include natural remedies in their treatment of BPH. However, there isn�t evidence that they�re effective.
Learn more about BPH natural remedies."
benign prostatic hypertrophy,"for benign prostatic hypertrophy, bph drugs?","When lifestyle changes aren�t enough to relieve your symptoms, your doctor may recommend medication.
There are several medications that can help to both treat the symptoms of BPH and BPH itself. These medications include:
alpha-1 blockers
hormone reduction medications
antibiotics
Learn more about BPH medications.
Alpha-1 blockers
Alpha-1 blockers are medications that relax the muscles of the bladder and prostate. Alpha-1 blockers relax the neck of the bladder and make it easier for urine to flow. Examples of alpha-1 blockers include:
doxazosin
prazosin
alfuzosin
terazosin
tamsulosin
Hormone reduction medications
Medications that reduce the levels of hormones produced by the prostate gland, such as dutasteride and finasteride, are commonly prescribed.
These two medications lower the levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a more potent variation of testosterone that affects hair and prostate growth, among other functions.
Sometimes, lowering the hormone levels will make the prostate get smaller and improve urine flow. However, in rare cases, these medications may also lead to side effects such as impotence and a decreased sex drive.
Antibiotics
Antibiotics may be used if your prostate becomes chronically inflamed from bacterial prostatitis related to BPH.
Treating bacterial prostatitis with antibiotics may improve your symptoms of BPH by reducing the inflammation. However, antibiotics won�t help prostatitis or inflammation that is not caused by bacteria."
benign prostatic hypertrophy,"for benign prostatic hypertrophy, surgery for bph?","There are different types of surgical procedures that can help treat BPH when medications aren�t effective. Some procedures are either noninvasive or minimally invasive and can often be done in your doctor�s office or clinic (outpatient procedures).
Others are more invasive and need to be done in a hospital (inpatient procedures).
Outpatient procedures
Outpatient procedures involve inserting an instrument into your urethra and into the prostate gland. They include:
Transurethral needle ablation (TUNA). Radio waves are used to scar and shrink prostate tissue.
Transurethral microwave therapy (TUMT). Microwave energy is used to eliminate prostate tissue.
Transurethral water vapor therapy (Rezum). Water vapor is used to destroy excess prostate tissue.
Water-induced thermotherapy (WIT). Heated water is used to destroy excess prostate tissue.
High-intensity focused ultrasonography (HIFU). Sonic energy is used to eliminate excess prostate tissue.
Urolift. The enlarged prostate is surgically lifted with the help of implants so that it doesn�t block the urethra.
Urolift and Rezum have both been shown
to be nearly as effective as inpatient surgical treatments like TURP, with the added benefits of being less invasive, less costly, and more likely to preserve sexual functionality.
Inpatient procedures
Inpatient procedures might be recommended if you have any of the following symptoms:
kidney failure
bladder stones
recurrent urinary tract infections
incontinence
a complete inability to empty the bladder
recurrent episodes of blood in the urine
Inpatient procedures include:
Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). This is the most commonly used surgical treatment for BPH and remains the gold standard surgical treatment. Your doctor inserts a small instrument through your urethra into the prostate. The prostate is then removed piece by piece.
Simple prostatectomy. Your doctor makes an incision in your abdomen or perineum, which is the area behind your scrotum. The inner part of your prostate is removed, leaving the outer part. After this procedure, you may have to stay in the hospital for up to 10 days.
Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP). This is similar to TURP, but your prostate isn�t removed. Instead, a small incision is made in your prostate that will enlarge your bladder outlet and urethra. The incision allows urine to flow more freely. You aren�t always required to stay in a hospital with this procedure."
benign prostatic hypertrophy,"for benign prostatic hypertrophy, complications of bph?","The symptoms of BPH can be easy to ignore. However, early treatment can help you avoid potentially dangerous complications. Call your doctor if you�re noticing symptoms of BPH.
People with a long-standing history of BPH may develop the following complications:
urinary tract infections
urinary stones
kidney damage
bleeding in the urinary tract
a sudden inability to urinate
Sometimes, urinary obstruction from BPH is so severe that no urine can leave the bladder at all. This is called bladder outlet obstruction. It can be dangerous because urine trapped in the bladder can cause urinary tract infections and damage your kidneys."
benign prostatic hypertrophy,"for benign prostatic hypertrophy, bph vs. prostate cancer?","BPH and prostate cancer don�t share symptoms. Prostate cancer is almost always asymptomatic and identified by either an elevated PSA or prostate nodule. It�s also a more serious condition than BPH.
Your doctor can test to make sure that your symptoms aren�t related to prostate cancer.
Learn more about the similarities and differences of BPH and prostate cancer."
benign prostatic hypertrophy,"for benign prostatic hypertrophy, takeaway?","BPH doesn�t always require medical treatment. Sometimes, your doctor will want you to have regular checkups to monitor your symptoms and the size of your prostate.
Lifestyle changes, medication, and surgery are all treatment options for symptoms that are affecting your quality of life.
Your doctor will work with you to develop a treatment plan that helps you manage your symptoms and live a healthy life. That�s why it�s important to discuss your symptoms of BPH with your doctor, no matter how minor you feel they may be."

Osteoarthritis
Normal wear and tear causes OA, one of the most common forms of arthritis. An infection or injury to the joints can exacerbate this natural breakdown of cartilage tissue.
Cartilage is a firm but flexible connective tissue in your joints. It protects the joints by absorbing the pressure and shock created when you move and put stress on them. A reduction in the normal amount of this cartilage tissue causes some forms of arthritis.
Your risk of developing OA may
also be higher if you have a family history of the disease.
Rheumatoid arthritis
Another common form of arthritis, RA, is an autoimmune disorder. It occurs when your body�s immune system attacks the tissues of the body, resulting in inflammation to joints as well as other body organs.
In the joints, this inflammatory response affects the synovium, a soft tissue in your joints that produces a fluid that nourishes the cartilage and lubricates the joints, eventually destroying both bone and cartilage inside the joint.
The exact cause of the immune system�s attacks is unknown. But scientists have discovered genetic markers that increase your risk of developing RA fivefold."
arthritis,"for arthritis, how is arthritis diagnosed??","Seeing your primary care physician is a good first step if you�re unsure who to see for an arthritis diagnosis. They will perform a physical exam to check for fluid around the joints, warm or red joints, and document the range of motion in the joints. Your doctor can refer you to a specialist if needed.
If you�re experiencing severe symptoms, you may choose to schedule an appointment with a rheumatologist first. This may lead to a faster diagnosis and treatment.
Documenting inflammation levels in your blood and aspirating and analyzing joint fluids, if present, can help your doctor determine what kind of arthritis you have.
Blood tests that check for specific types of antibodies like anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), rheumatoid factor (RF) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) are also common diagnostic tests.
Doctors commonly use imaging scans such as X-ray, MRI, and CT scans to produce an image of your bones and cartilage. This helps them rule out other causes of your symptoms, such as bone spurs.

arthritis,"for arthritis, how is arthritis treated??","The main goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of pain you�re experiencing and prevent additional damage to the joints. You�ll learn what works best for you in terms of managing pain.
In general, treatment for arthritis involves
a combination of:
medications and supplements
physical therapy
occupational therapy
nutrient-rich diet
regular exercise
weight loss, if needed
heat and cold compresses
mobility assistance devices, such as canes or walkers
Improving your joint function is also important. Your doctor may prescribe a combination of treatment methods to achieve the best results.
Medications
A number of different types of medication treat arthritis:
Analgesics, such as hydrocodone (Vicodin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol), are effective for pain management, but do not help decrease inflammation.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil) and salicylates, help manage pain and inflammation. Salicylates can thin the blood, so they should not be used with additional blood thinning medications.
Menthol or capsaicin creams. These creams block the transmission of pain signals from your joints.
Steroids, like prednisone, help reduce inflammation but should be used cautiously and for brief periods of time.
Immunosuppressants and biologics. Immunosuppressants and biologics are prescribed for moderate to severe inflammatory arthritis like RA.
If you have RA, your doctor may recommend corticosteroids or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), which suppress your immune system.
DMARDs and biologics are being prescribed earlier in the course of RA. Methotrexate is now a first-line drug for treatment.
There are also many medications to treat OA available over the counter or by prescription.
Supplements
While clinical evidence and safety data
are lacking for many herbs and supplements marketed for arthritis, there are a few supplements that may be beneficial. For example, avocado and soybean unsaponifiables (ASU) may help OA symptoms. Fish oil and turmeric supplements may help reduce inflammation in RA.
However, you should talk with your doctor before taking any supplements for arthritis to make sure they are safe for you and will not interact with any medications you�re currently taking.
Surgery
Surgery to replace your joint with an artificial one may be an option. This form of surgery is most commonly performed to replace hips and knees.
If your arthritis is most severe in your fingers or wrists, your doctor may perform joint fusion. In this procedure, the ends of your bones are fused, eliminating the joint and therefore eliminating the site of inflammation.
Physical therapy
Physical therapy involving exercises that help strengthen the muscles around the affected joint is a core component of arthritis treatment.
Outside of your appointments, your physical therapist will likely recommend a plan of care that includes daily movement along with exercises you can complete on your own at home. Collectively, these can help build strength, flexibility, and balance to improve mobility while also preventing falls."
arthritis,"for arthritis, what lifestyle changes can help people with arthritis??","Losing any excess weight and maintaining a moderate weight reduces the risk
of developing OA and can reduce symptoms if you already have the condition.
Eating a nutrient-dense diet is important for weight loss. Choosing a diet with lots of antioxidants, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs, can help reduce inflammation. Other inflammation-reducing foods include fish and nuts.
Foods that should be limited or avoided if you have arthritis include:
fried foods
processed foods
dairy products
a high intake of meat
Some research
also suggests that gluten antibodies may be present in people with RA. A gluten-free diet may improve symptoms and disease progression. A 2015 study
also recommends a gluten-free diet for all people who receive a diagnosis of undifferentiated connective tissue disease.
Regular exercise can keep your joints flexible. Swimming is often a good form of exercise for people with arthritis because it does not put pressure on your joints the way running and walking do. Staying active is important, but listening to your body when it�s signally resting and avoiding overexerting yourself are just as essential.
At-home exercises you can try include:
the head tilt, neck rotation, and other exercises to relieve pain in your neck
finger bends and thumb bends to ease pain in your hands
leg raises, hamstring stretches, and other easy exercises for knee arthritis"
arthritis,"for arthritis, complications?","When left untreated, symptoms of arthritis may worsen and affect your day-to-day life. Below are some of the possible complications associated with this condition:
Reduced mobility. As arthritis progresses, you may experience less comfortable movement. This can interfere with your daily routine and may keep you from your favorite activities as well as socializing.
Possible weight gain. This is attributed to decreased movements, as well as discomfort that keeps you from exercising.
Increased risk of metabolic disorders. Being overweight with an inflammatory condition like arthritis may increase your chances of developing type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and heart disease.
Inflammation in other areas of your body. If your arthritis is attributed to an autoimmune disease like with RA, the inflammation can spread and affect your skin, eyes, blood vessels, and lungs.
Risk of falls. According to the Arthritis Foundation, people with OA are more likely to experience falls and possible fractures. This is primarily caused by related muscle weakness, but dizziness from pain medications can also lead to falls.
Decreased ability to work. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that about 60 percent
of people with arthritis are working age. Arthritis may affect your ability to move around in the workplace or even get from your mode of transportation to your job site.
Effects on mental health. Arthritis may increase the risk of anxiety and depression due to ongoing pain, inflammation, and social isolation.

arthritis,"for arthritis, risk factors?","The overall risk factors for arthritis
include:
Obesity. Particularly associated with OA, being overweight puts added stress on weight-bearing joints in the body, such as your knees and hips. Losing excess weight can help reduce your risk of developing arthritis, and it may also help if you already have the condition.
Age and gender. The risk of developing arthritis increases with age. Also, women are more likely
than men to develop most forms of arthritis. The exception is gout, which is more prominent in men.
Overuse injuries. Repetitive stress injuries incurred during exercise, your job, or other activities may increase your risk of developing OA in the affected joint(s) later in life.
Your genes. A family history of autoimmune diseases as well as certain inherited genes may increase your risk of RA and other related types of arthritis.
Smoking. Your risk of developing RA may increase if you smoke
, and smoking can in turn make this autoimmune disease worse."
arthritis,"for arthritis, what is the long-term outlook for people with arthritis??","While there�s no cure for arthritis, the right treatment can greatly reduce your symptoms.

Could you describe what osteoporosis is? I�d like to know more about osteoporosis. Can you help? What information do you have on osteoporosis? Could you provide information on osteoporosis?,"Overview
Bone in your body constantly breaks down, and new bone replaces it. Osteoporosis is a condition in which bones break down faster than they can be replaced, making them less dense and more porous. This brittleness weakens bones and makes them more susceptible to fractures and breaks.
Osteoporosis can have a big impact on your quality of life. Lifestyle disruptions range from pain to depression to long-term home care.
People who have osteoporosis or are likely to develop it should be aware of potential complications of the disease and seek solutions before issues arise."
osteoporosis,"for osteoporosis, symptoms of osteoporosis?","There are no obvious signs of osteoporosis. Often, people don�t realize they have it until they experience a bump or fall that causes a bone to break. Some people will experience a loss of height over time or a stooped posture as a result of a broken vertebrae and curvature of the spine."
osteoporosis,"for osteoporosis, complications of osteoporosis?","In addition to making you more susceptible to breaks and fractures, osteoporosis can lead to other complications:
Limited mobility
Osteoporosis can be disabling and limit your physical activity. A loss of activity can cause you to gain weight. It can also increase stress on your bones, in particular your knees and hips. Gaining weight can also increase your risk of other problems, such as heart disease and diabetes.
Depression
Less physical activity can lead to a loss of independence and isolation. Activities you once enjoyed may be too painful now. This loss, added to the possible fear of fractures, can bring on depression. A poor emotional state can further hinder your ability to manage health issues. A positive, forward-thinking outlook is helpful when approaching any medical issue.
Pain
Fractures caused by osteoporosis can be severely painful and debilitating. Fractures of the spine can result in:
a loss of height
a stooping posture
persistent back and neck pain
Hospital admission
Some people with osteoporosis can break a bone and not notice it. However, most broken bones need hospital care. Surgery is often needed for this procedure, which may require an extended hospital stay and additional medical costs.
Nursing home care
Many times, a hip fracture will require long-term care in a nursing home. If a person is bedridden while receiving long-term care, there�s a higher likelihood, they may experience:
cardiovascular complications
more exposure to infectious diseases
an increased susceptibility to various other complications
Talk to your healthcare provider for more information about these potential risk factors. They can also help you create both a treatment and management plan if and when necessary."
osteoporosis,"for osteoporosis, causes and risk factors of osteoporosis?","The following are some factors that put you at a higher risk of developing osteoporosis:
Age: Typically, the older you get, the more at risk you are.
Gender: Women, especially women in menopause, are more likely to get osteoporosis than men, as low estrogen levels lead to weak bones.
Genetics: Osteoporosis can be inherited.
Body type: People with a small, slender build are more likely to develop it.
Medications: Medications such as steroids have been linked to osteoporosis, according to the Mayo Clinic.
Thyroid problems: Some have been linked to osteoporosis.
Low vitamin D and calcium levels: Low levels can lead to bone loss.
Lack of exercise or long-term bed rest: Both situations can weaken bones.
Tobacco and alcohol: They can weaken bones as well."
osteoporosis,"for osteoporosis, treatment and prevention?","There isn�t a cure for osteoporosis. However, treatment is available to help slow the progression of the disease and manage symptoms. Bones need calcium to stay strong and healthy. Not getting enough calcium early on in life can lead to osteoporosis later on.
Additionally, vitamin D can help your body absorb calcium. Be sure to check with your doctor about adding any supplements to your diet.
A moderate amount of exercise can help your bones and body stay strong. Falls account for a large number of bone fractures, so practices such as yoga, tai chi, or any other balance-training exercises can help you have better balance to avoid falls and fractures.
Medications can also help with osteoporosis. Antiresorptive medications slow the rate of bone loss. Anabolic medications promote bone growth.
For women in menopause, estrogen therapy can help prevent bone loss and strengthen bones. For women in post-menopause, bisphosphonates are the preferred treatment for osteoporosis.
Other prevention methods involve improving eyesight and using a cane or walker when walking to prevent slipping and falling."
osteoporosis,"for osteoporosis, long-term outlook?","Although there�s no permanent cure for osteoporosis, there are many things you can do to:
treat your symptoms
strengthen your body
slow the progression of the disease
Try to focus on minimizing your symptoms and preventing other complications.
If osteoporosis has affected your quality of life, talk with your doctor about possible solutions, especially if you�re experiencing signs of depression. Also, seek assistance and support from your family and friends.
Keep a positive outlook on life. Try to not view changes in your usual activities as a loss of independence. Instead, look at them as opportunities to learn different ways of doing things and to explore new, enjoyable activities."
pancreatitis,what is pancreatitis? Tell me about pancreatitis? What kind of disease is pancreatitis? Can you elaborate on pancreatitis? What can you tell me about pancreatitis? Could you describe what pancreatitis is? I�d like to know more about pancreatitis. Can you help? What information do you have on pancreatitis? Could you provide information on pancreatitis?,Acute pancreatitis can occur due to infection or another health condition. You may experience symptoms that include pain within minutes of eating and pain that spreads to your left shoulder.
pancreatitis,"for pancreatitis, what is acute pancreatitis??","The pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach and near the small intestine. It produces and distributes insulin, digestive enzymes, and other necessary hormones.
Acute pancreatitis (AP) is inflammation of the pancreas. It occurs suddenly and causes pain in the upper abdominal (or epigastric) region. The pain often radiates to your back.
AP can also involve other organs. It can also develop into chronic pancreatitis if you have continued episodes."
pancreatitis,"for pancreatitis, what causes acute pancreatitis??","Acute pancreatitis is caused directly or indirectly. Direct causes affect the pancreas itself, its tissues, or its ducts. Indirect causes result from diseases or conditions that originate somewhere else in your body.
Gallstones are one of the major causes of acute pancreatitis. Gallstones can lodge in the common bile duct and block the pancreatic duct. This impairs fluid from flowing to and from the pancreas and causes damage.
Direct causes
Other direct causes of acute pancreatitis include:
sudden immune system attacks on the pancreas, or autoimmune pancreatitis
pancreatic or gallbladder damage from surgery or injury
excessive fats called triglycerides in your blood
Indirect causes
Indirect causes of acute pancreatitis include:
alcohol abuse
cystic fibrosis, a serious condition that affects your lungs, liver, and pancreas
Kawasaki disease, a disease that occurs in children younger than 5 years old
viral infections like mumps and bacterial infections like mycoplasma
Reye�s syndrome, a complication from certain viruses that can also affect the liver
certain medications containing estrogen, corticosteroids, or certain antibiotics"
pancreatitis,"for pancreatitis, who is at risk for acute pancreatitis??","Drinking too much alcohol can put you at risk for pancreatic inflammation. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) defines �too much� as more than one drink a day for women and a maximum of two drinks a day for men. Men are more at risk than women for developing alcohol-related pancreatitis.
Smoking tobacco also increases your chance of AP. Smoking and drinking rates are similar in black and white Americans, but black Americans are more than two times as likely to develop AP. A family history of cancer, inflammation, or another pancreatic condition also puts you at risk."
pancreatitis,"for pancreatitis, recognizing the symptoms of acute pancreatitis?",The predominant symptom of acute pancreatitis is abdominal pain.
pancreatitis,"for pancreatitis, break it down: abdominal pain?","Break It Down: Abdominal Pain
Watch as we explain the many different causes for abdominal pain and what to know before talking to your doctor.
0 seconds of 1 minute, 43 seconds
Pain may vary depending on certain factors. These include:
pain within minutes of drinking or eating food
pain spreading from your abdomen to your back or left shoulder blade area
pain that lasts for several days at a time
pain when you lie on your back, more so than when sitting up
Other symptoms can also increase the pain and discomfort. These include:
fever
nausea
vomiting
sweating
jaundice (yellowing of the skin)
diarrhea
bloating
When any of these symptoms are accompanied by abdominal pain, you should seek immediate medical care."
pancreatitis,"for pancreatitis, diagnosing acute pancreatitis?","Your doctor can diagnose AP by using blood tests and scans. The blood test looks for enzymes (amylase and lipase) leaking from the pancreas. An ultrasound, CT, or MRI scan allows your doctor to see any abnormalities in or around your pancreas. Your doctor will also ask about your medical history and ask you to describe your discomfort."
pancreatitis,"for pancreatitis, treating acute pancreatitis?","Often you will be admitted to the hospital for more testing and to make sure you get enough fluids, usually intravenously. Your doctor may order medications to reduce pain and treat any possible infections. If these treatments don�t work, you may need surgery to remove damaged tissue, drain fluid, or correct blocked ducts. If gallstones caused the problem, you may need surgery to remove the gallbladder.
If your doctor concludes that a medication is causing your acute pancreatitis, stop using that medication right away. If a traumatic injury caused your pancreatitis, avoid the activity until you�re fully recovered from treatment. Check with your doctor before increasing your activity.
You may experience a lot of pain after acute pancreatitis, surgery, or other treatments. If prescribed pain medication, be sure to follow your doctor�s plan to reduce your discomfort once you get home. Avoid smoking completely, and drink a lot of fluids to make sure you don�t get dehydrated.
If pain or discomfort is still unbearable, it is important to check back with your doctor for a follow-up evaluation.
Acute pancreatitis is sometimes linked with type 2 diabetes, which affects your insulin production. Eating foods like lean protein, leafy vegetables, and whole grains can help your pancreas produce insulin more regularly and gently.
Lifestyle and diet
Stay hydrated at all times. Keep a water bottle or an electrolyte-infused drink like Gatorade.
Help prevent AP by limiting the amount of alcohol you drink. If you�ve already had pancreatitis and haven�t made lifestyle changes, it�s possible to develop it again. Children, and teens under the age of 19, should not take aspirin unless their doctor prescribes it. Aspirin can cause Reye�s syndrome, which is a known trigger for acute pancreatitis."
pancreatitis,"for pancreatitis, complications of acute pancreatitis?","Acute pancreatitis can cause pseudocysts in your pancreas. These fluid-filled sacks can lead to infections and even internal bleeding. Acute pancreatitis can also disrupt the balance of your body chemistry. This can lead to more complications.
You might also face the possibility of diabetes or kidney issues that lead to dialysis. Or malnutrition, if your acute pancreatitis is severe, or if you develop chronic pancreatitis over time.
In some people, acute pancreatitis can be the first sign of pancreatic cancer. Talk to your doctor about treatment as soon as you�re diagnosed with acute pancreatitis to avoid complications. Quick and effective treatment reduces your risk of complications significantly."
pancreatitis,"for pancreatitis, outlook?","Pancreatitis can cause serious short-term pain. Untreated cases and recurrences can lead to chronic problems. Most cases can be treated. If you�re admitted to the hospital for acute pancreatitis, how long you will need to stay is based on the severity of your episode. Avoid drinking alcohol, strenuous exercise, and follow a diet plan that allows your pancreas to heal before returning to your normal diet.
Pancreatitis symptoms can be confusing. Abdominal pain and back pain can have other causes. If you notice these symptoms see your doctor.
Acute pancreatitis can be treated successfully, and usually lifestyle changes will allow you to live your life comfortably, even if you have flare-ups now and then. Talk to your doctor to make sure you�re following the right treatment plan and lifestyle changes to lessen your risk of future bouts of acute pancreatitis."
incontinence,what is incontinence? Tell me about incontinence? What kind of disease is incontinence? Can you elaborate on incontinence? What can you tell me about incontinence? Could you describe what incontinence is? I�d like to know more about incontinence. Can you help? What information do you have on incontinence? Could you provide information on incontinence?,"Stress incontinence is the inability to control your urge to urinate in certain circumstances. It�s a serious and embarrassing disorder and can lead to social isolation.
Any pressure placed on the abdomen and bladder can lead to the loss of urine.
It�s important to remember that the term �stress� is used in a strictly physical sense when describing stress incontinence. It refers to excessive pressure on the bladder and not emotional stress.
An overactive bladder is a separate condition. In some cases, both overactive bladder and stress incontinence can occur, which is called mixed incontinence. Your doctor can do tests to determine which is causing your incontinence."
incontinence,"for incontinence, anatomy of the bladder?","Your bladder is supported by a system of muscles:
The sphincter encircles the urethra, the tube that carries urine outside of your body.
The detrusor is the muscle of the bladder wall, which allows it to expand.
The pelvic floor muscles help support the bladder and the urethra.
To hold urine inside your bladder without leakage, you need to be able to contract your sphincter. When your sphincter and pelvic muscles are weak, it�s more difficult to contract these muscles and the result is stress incontinence."
incontinence,"for incontinence, stress incontinence symptoms?","The main symptom of stress incontinence is the loss of bladder control during physical activity. You may experience a few drops of urine or a large, involuntary flow. This can happen while you are:
laughing
sneezing
coughing
jumping
exercising
doing heavy lifting
engaging in sexual intercourse
Sometimes even standing up from a seated or reclining position can put additional pressure on your bladder and cause a leakage. Stress incontinence is unique for every individual. You may not show symptoms every time you participate in an activity, and the same activities that cause leakage for you may not affect another person with stress incontinence."
incontinence,"for incontinence, who suffers from stress incontinence??","According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), women are twice as likely as men to suffer from involuntary leakage. The most common causes of stress incontinence among women are pregnancy and childbirth, especially having multiple vaginal deliveries. During pregnancy and childbirth, the sphincter and pelvic muscles stretch out and are weakened.
Older age and conditions that cause a chronic cough can also cause stress incontinence. This condition can also be a side effect of pelvic surgery.
Some women only suffer from stress incontinence during the week before they get their period. The NIDDK
explains that estrogen drops during this phase of the menstrual cycle, which can weaken the urethra. This is not common though.
Among men, prostate surgery is a common cause of stress incontinence. The prostate gland surrounds the male urethra, and its removal can result in the loss of support of the urethra.
Other risk factors for stress incontinence include:
smoking due to chronic cough
any other condition associated with chronic cough
excessive caffeine and alcohol use
obesity
constipation
long-term participation in high-impact activities
hormonal deficiencies"
incontinence,"for incontinence, treatment for stress incontinence?","Treatment for stress incontinence varies according to the underlying cause of your problem. Your doctor will help you come up with a treatment plan using a combination of medications and lifestyle adjustments.
Behavioral therapy
You can change your lifestyle and the way you live to reduce episodes of stress incontinence. If you�re obese, your doctor may advise you to lose weight. You might also try to avoid activities that cause leakage, such as jumping or jogging.
Nicotine can irritate your bladder and may contribute to incontinence. If you�re a smoker, you should quit. The constant cough seen in smokers also contributes to the problem. Also, consider avoiding caffeine and alcohol, because these substances are bladder irritants. You might want to cut back on your overall fluid intake to reduce bladder pressure.
Pelvic muscle training
For many women, pelvic muscle training can help treat stress incontinence. Kegel exercises make your sphincter and pelvic muscles stronger. To perform a Kegel, contract the muscles you use to stop a stream of urine. It can be helpful to practice doing Kegels while sitting on the toilet to help you learn which muscles to use. Once you have mastered the exercise, you can perform them anywhere and at any time.
Electrical stimulation is another treatment, and it sends a mild electrical current through your pelvic floor muscles. The current makes your muscles contract, mimicking a Kegel exercise. You may be able to contract the muscles yourself after feeling exactly which muscles are contracting.
Medication
There are currently no FDA-approved medications to treat stress incontinence. Both oral and topical estrogen supplements may help in women. Sometimes, pseudoephedrine is used with success. The FDA is evaluating Cymbalta, an antidepressant, which seems to show promise in treating stress incontinence.
Surgery
If you have a severe case of stress incontinence, to the point that it interferes with your everyday life, your doctor may recommend surgery. Several types of procedures are available and include vaginal repairs and other procedures to lift the bladder and urethra. These surgeries are being perfected on an ongoing basis and a qualified surgeon can explain your many options.
During the surgery, doctors will try to provide your urethra and bladder with more support. A sling procedure uses your own tissues to create a support structure for the urethra. The Mayo Clinic states that slings are used more often in women than in men.
Your urologist, a doctor who specializes in the urinary tract, may also choose to inject collagen directly into the supportive tissues of your urethra. This strengthens the sphincter muscle by increasing pressure on the urethra. Collagen injections are the least invasive surgical procedure to treat stress incontinence."

I�d like to know more about hernia. Can you help? What information do you have on hernia? Could you provide information on hernia?,"Hernias typically result from a combination of muscle weakness and strain. Doctors may suggest watchful waiting for complications or surgery to repair the hernia, depending on severity."
hernia,"for hernia, what is a hernia??","A hernia occurs when an organ pushes through an opening in the muscle or tissue that holds it in place. For example, the intestines may break through a weakened area in the abdominal wall.
Many hernias occur in the abdomen between your chest and hips, but they can also appear in the upper thigh and groin areas.
Most hernias aren�t immediately life threatening, but they don�t go away on their own. Sometimes they can require surgery to prevent dangerous complications."
hernia,"for hernia, types of hernia?","There are several different types of hernias. Below, we�ll explore some of the most common ones.
Inguinal hernia
Inguinal hernias are the most common type of hernia. They occur when the intestines push through a weak spot or tear in the lower abdominal wall, often in the inguinal canal.
The inguinal canal is found in your groin. In men, it�s the area where the spermatic cord passes from the abdomen to the scrotum. This cord attaches to the testicles. In women, the inguinal canal contains a ligament (called the round ligament) that helps hold the uterus in place.
Inguinal hernias are more common in men because the testicles descend through the inguinal canal shortly after birth. The canal is supposed to close almost completely behind them. Sometimes the canal doesn�t close properly, leaving a weakened area. Learn more about inguinal hernias.
Hiatal hernia
A hiatal hernia occurs when part of your stomach protrudes up through the diaphragm into your chest cavity. The diaphragm is a sheet of muscle that helps you breathe by contracting and drawing air into the lungs. It separates the organs in your abdomen from those in your chest.
This type of hernia is most common in people over 50 years old. If a child has the condition, it�s typically caused by a congenital birth irregularity.
Hiatal hernias almost always cause gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In GERD, the stomach contents leak backward into the esophagus, causing a burning sensation. Get more information on hiatal hernias.
Umbilical hernia
Umbilical hernias can affect children and babies. They occur when the intestines bulge through the abdominal wall near the belly button. You may notice a bulge in or near your child�s belly button, especially when they�re crying.
An umbilical hernia is the only kind that often goes away on its own as the abdominal wall muscles get stronger. This typically happens by the time the child is 1 or 2 years old
. If the hernia hasn�t gone away by 5 years of age, surgery can be performed to correct it.
Adults can also have umbilical hernias. They can occur from repeated strain on the abdomen due to conditions such as obesity, fluid in the abdomen (ascites), or pregnancy. Discover additional details about umbilical hernias.
Ventral hernia
A ventral hernia happens when tissue bulges through an opening in the muscles of your abdomen. You may notice that a ventral hernia decreases in size when you�re lying down.
Although a ventral hernia can be present from birth, it�s more commonly acquired at some point during your lifetime. Common factors in ventral hernia formation include obesity, pregnancy, and strenuous activity.
Ventral hernias can also occur at the site of a surgical incision. This is called an incisional hernia and can result from surgical scarring or weakness of the abdominal muscles at the surgical site. Continue reading about ventral hernias."
hernia,"for hernia, hernia symptoms?","The most common symptom of a hernia is a bulge or lump in the affected area. For example, in the case of an inguinal hernia, you may notice a lump on either side of your pubic bone where your groin and thigh meet.
You may find that the lump �disappears� when you�re lying down. You�re more likely to feel your hernia through touch when you�re standing up, bending down, or coughing. Discomfort or pain in the area around the lump may also be present.
Some types of hernia, such as hiatal hernias, can have more specific symptoms. These can include heartburn, trouble swallowing, and chest pain.
In many cases, hernias have no symptoms. You may not know you have a hernia unless it shows up while you�re undergoing a medical exam for an unrelated problem or a routine physical."
hernia,"for hernia, hernia causes?","Hernias are caused by a combination of muscle weakness and strain. Depending on its cause, a hernia can develop quickly or over a long period of time.
Some common causes of muscle weakness or strain that can lead to a hernia include:
a congenital condition, which occurs during development in the womb and is present from birth
aging
damage from an injury or surgery
strenuous exercise or lifting heavy weights
chronic coughing or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD)
pregnancy, especially having multiple pregnancies
constipation, which causes you to strain when having a bowel movement
being overweight or having obesity
ascites
There are also certain risk factors that make you more likely to develop a hernia. They include:
being born prematurely or having a low birth weight
being older
chronic cough (likely due to the repetitive increase in abdominal pressure)
cystic fibrosis
pregnancy
chronic constipation
being overweight or having obesity
smoking, which leads to the weakening of connective tissue
a personal or family history of hernias"
hernia,"for hernia, hernia treatment?","The only way to effectively treat a hernia is through surgical repair. Whether or not you need surgery depends on the size of your hernia and the severity of your symptoms.
Your doctor may want to simply monitor your hernia for possible complications. This approach is called watchful waiting.
In some cases, wearing a truss may help to ease the symptoms of a hernia. A truss is a supportive undergarment that helps to hold the hernia in place. Always see your doctor to make sure that a truss fits properly before using it.
If you have a hiatal hernia, over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications that reduce stomach acid can relieve your discomfort and improve symptoms. These include antacids, H2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors."
hernia,"for hernia, hernia diagnosis?","To diagnose your condition, your doctor will first perform a physical examination. During this examination, the doctor may feel for a bulge in your abdominal or groin area that gets larger when you stand, cough, or strain.
Your doctor will then take your medical history. They may ask you a variety of questions, including:
When did you first notice the bulge?
Have you experienced any other symptoms?
Do you think something in particular may have caused it to occur?
Tell me a little bit about your lifestyle. Does your occupation involve heavy lifting? Do you exercise rigorously? Do you lift weights professionally or recreationally? Do you have a history of smoking?
Do you have a personal or family history of hernias?
Have you had any surgeries in your abdominal or groin area?
Your doctor will also likely use imaging tests to aid in their diagnosis. These can include:
Abdominal ultrasound. Abdominal ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the structures inside the body.
Abdominal CT scan. Abdominal CT scan combines X-rays with computer technology to produce an image.
Abdominal MRI scan. Abdominal MRI scan uses a combination of strong magnets and radio waves to create an image.
If your doctor suspects a hiatal hernia, they may use other tests that allow them to assess the inside of your stomach:
X-rays of your digestive tract. A healthcare professional will have you drink a liquid containing diatrizoate meglumine/diatrizoate sodium (Gastrografin) or a liquid barium solution. These liquids help your digestive tract appear highlighted on X-ray images.
Endoscopy. During an endoscopy, a healthcare professional threads a small camera attached to a tube down your throat and into your esophagus and stomach.

Increasing your fiber intake may help relieve constipation. Constipation can cause straining during bowel movements, which can aggravate a hernia. Some examples of high fiber foods include whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.
Dietary changes can also help with the symptoms of a hiatal hernia. Try to avoid large or heavy meals, don�t lie down or bend over after a meal, and keep your body weight in a moderate range.
To prevent acid reflux, avoid foods that may cause it, such as spicy foods and tomato-based foods. Additionally, giving up cigarettes may also help, if you smoke."
hernia,"for hernia, hernia exercises?","Exercise may work to strengthen muscles around the hernia and promote weight loss, helping reduce some symptoms.
A study from 2018
investigated the effects of an exercise program on people with obesity who were undergoing ventral hernia repair surgery. The people who completed the exercise program had fewer complications following surgery.
Remember that some types of exercise, such as weightlifting or exercises that strain the abdomen, may increase pressure at the area of the hernia. This may actually cause the hernia to bulge more. The same is true for exercises that are done improperly.
If you have a hernia, it�s best to discuss exercising with a doctor or physical therapist. They can work closely with you to let you know which exercises are best for you and how to perform them properly to prevent irritating your hernia."
hernia,"for hernia, hernia recovery?","It�s important to recognize the symptoms of a hernia and to see a doctor if you suspect that you have one.
An untreated hernia won�t go away by itself, and hernias can cause complications that are life threatening. A doctor can assess your hernia and determine the best treatment option.
Early medical care and lifestyle changes can minimize symptoms. However, surgery is the only way to effectively treat a hernia. There are different types of hernia repair surgeries, and a surgeon can advise on which one is right for your condition.
The outlook for people who undergo hernia repair surgery is generally very good. However, it can depend on the nature of the hernia, your symptoms, and your overall health. In some cases, the hernia may recur after repair surgery."
hernia,"for hernia, hernia repair surgery?","If your hernia is growing larger or causing pain, a surgeon may decide it�s best to operate.
If the hernia causes an extra hole in your abdominal wall, they may repair your hernia by sewing the hole in the abdominal wall closed during surgery. This is commonly done by patching the hole with surgical mesh.
Sometimes a hernia results in one of the body�s passageways opening even wider than it should. For example, this can occur in the space where the esophagus is meant to pass through the diaphragm. In these cases, surgery can be performed to tighten the opening.
Hernias can be repaired with either open or laparoscopic surgery.
During open surgery, the surgeon makes an incision close to the site of the hernia, and then pushes the bulging tissue back into the abdomen. They then sew the area shut, sometimes reinforcing it with surgical mesh. Finally, they close the incision.
Laparoscopic surgery uses a tiny camera and miniaturized surgical equipment to repair the hernia. It only requires a few small incisions and is less damaging to the surrounding tissue.
Not all hernias are suitable for laparoscopic surgery. If your hernia requires an open surgical repair, your surgeon will work with you to determine which technique is best for your condition. Find out more about inguinal hernia repair.
Recovery from surgery
After your surgery, you may experience pain around the surgical site. Your surgeon will prescribe medication to help ease this discomfort while you recover.
Be sure to carefully follow your surgeon�s instructions involving wound care. Contact them promptly if you notice any signs of infection such as fever, redness or drainage at the site, or pain that suddenly worsens.
Following your hernia repair, you may be unable to move around normally for several weeks. You�ll need to avoid any strenuous activity. Additionally, you should avoid lifting objects heavier than 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) during this period. This is slightly more than the weight of a gallon of milk.
Open surgery often requires a longer recovery process than laparoscopic surgery. Your surgeon will let you know when you can return to your normal routine."
hernia,"for hernia, hernia in babies?","Between 10 and 25 percent of babies are born with an umbilical hernia. This type of hernia is also more common in babies who are born prematurely or with a low birth weight.
Umbilical hernias occur near the belly button. They form when the muscles surrounding the hole left by the umbilical cord don�t close properly. This causes a portion of the intestine to bulge out.
If your child has an umbilical hernia, you may notice it more when they�re crying or coughing. Umbilical hernias in children are typically painless. However, when symptoms such as pain, vomiting, or swelling at the hernia site occur, you should seek emergency medical attention.
See your child�s pediatrician if you notice that your child has an umbilical hernia. Umbilical hernias typically go away when a child is 1 or 2 years old. If it doesn�t disappear by the age of 5, surgery can be performed to repair it. Learn more about umbilical hernia repair."
hernia,"for hernia, pregnancy and hernia?","If you�re pregnant and think that you have a hernia, see a doctor. They can evaluate it and determine if it poses any health risks.
Often, hernia repair can wait until after delivery. If a small hernia that�s present before or during the pregnancy begins to get larger or cause discomfort, surgery may be advised to repair it. The recommended time to have this performed is during the second trimester.
Hernias that have been repaired in the past may return with later pregnancies. This is because pregnancy places a strain on abdominal muscle tissue that may have been weakened by surgery.
Hernias can also occur following a cesarean delivery. During a cesarean delivery, a doctor makes an incision into the abdomen and uterus. The baby is then delivered through these incisions.
An incisional hernia can sometimes occur at the site of a cesarean delivery. Get more details about hernias that occur after a cesarean delivery."
hernia,"for hernia, hernia complications?","Sometimes an untreated hernia can lead to potentially serious complications.
Your hernia may grow and cause more symptoms. It may also put too much pressure on nearby tissues, which can cause swelling and pain in the surrounding area.
A portion of your intestine could also become trapped in the abdominal wall. This is called incarceration. Incarceration can obstruct your bowel and cause severe pain, nausea, or constipation.
If the trapped section of your intestines doesn�t get enough blood flow, strangulation occurs. This can cause the intestinal tissue to become infected or die. A strangulated hernia is life threatening and requires immediate medical care.
Some symptoms that can signal that you need to seek out emergency medical attention for your hernia include:
a bulge that becomes red or purple
pain that suddenly gets worse
nausea
vomiting
fever
not being able to pass gas or have bowel movements"
hernia,"for hernia, hernia prevention?","You can�t always prevent a hernia from developing. Sometimes a hernia occurs because of an existing inherited condition or a previous surgery.
However, you can make some simple lifestyle adjustments to help lower your risk of a hernia. These steps aim to reduce the amount of strain you place on your body.
Here are a few general prevention tips:
If you smoke, consider quitting. You can work with your doctor to create a smoking cessation plan that�s right for you.
See a doctor when you�re sick to avoid developing a persistent cough.
Maintain a moderate body weight.
Try not to strain while having a bowel movement or during urination.
Eat enough high fiber foods to prevent constipation.
Perform exercises that help to strengthen the muscles of your abdomen.
Avoid lifting weights that are too heavy for you. If you must lift something heavy, bend at your knees and not your waist or back. Also avoid holding your breath when lifting heavy objects. Instead, exhale during the lift to decrease the chance of a hiatal hernia happening or worsening."

I�d like to know more about malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast. Can you help? What information do you have on malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast? Could you provide information on malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast?,"Breast cancer occurs when breast cells develop mutations and begin to divide and multiply. People may first notice a lump in the breast, discoloration, texture changes, or other symptoms.
We will often use �men� and �women� in this article to reflect the terms that have been historically used to gender people. But your gender identity may not align with your breast cancer risk. Your doctor can help you better understand how your specific circumstances will translate into breast cancer risk factors and symptoms."
malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast,"for malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast, what is breast cancer??","Cancer occurs when changes called mutations take place in genes that regulate cell growth. The mutations let the cells divide and multiply in an uncontrolled way.
Breast cancer is cancer that develops in breast cells. Typically, the cancer forms in either the lobules or the ducts of the breast.
Lobules are the glands that produce milk, and ducts are the pathways that bring the milk from the glands to the nipple. Cancer can also occur in the fatty tissue or the fibrous connective tissue within your breast.
The uncontrolled cancer cells often invade other healthy breast tissue and can travel to the lymph nodes under the arms. Once the cancer enters the lymph nodes, it has access to a pathway to move to other parts of the body.
See pictures and learn more about the structure of the breast."
malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast,"for malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast, signs and symptoms of breast cancer?","In its early stages, breast cancer may not cause any symptoms. In many cases, a tumor may be too small to be felt, but an abnormality can still be seen on a mammogram.
If a tumor can be felt, the first sign is usually a new lump in the breast that was not there before. However, not all lumps are cancer.
Each type of breast cancer can cause a variety of symptoms. Many of these symptoms are similar, but some can be different. Symptoms for the most common breast cancers include:
a breast lump or tissue thickening that feels different from surrounding tissue and is new
breast pain
red or discolored, pitted skin on the breast
swelling in all or part of your breast
a nipple discharge other than breast milk
bloody discharge from your nipple
peeling, scaling, or flaking of skin on your nipple or breast
a sudden, unexplained change in the shape or size of your breast
inverted nipple
changes to the appearance of the skin on your breasts
a lump or swelling under your arm
If you have any of these symptoms, it doesn�t necessarily mean you have breast cancer. For instance, pain in your breast or a breast lump can be caused by a benign cyst.
Still, if you find a lump in your breast or have other symptoms, contact your doctor for further examination and testing.
Learn more about possible symptoms of breast cancer."
malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast,"for malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast, types of breast cancer?","There are several types of breast cancer, and they�re broken into two main categories: invasive and noninvasive. Noninvasive breast cancer is also known as breast cancer in situ.
While invasive cancer has spread from the breast ducts or glands to other parts of the breast, noninvasive cancer has not spread from the original tissue.
These two categories are used to describe the most common types of breast cancer, which include:
Ductal carcinoma in situ. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a noninvasive condition. With DCIS, the cancer cells are confined to the ducts in your breast and haven�t invaded the surrounding breast tissue.
Lobular carcinoma in situ. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is cancer that grows in the milk-producing glands of your breast. Like DCIS, the cancer cells haven�t invaded the surrounding tissue.
Invasive ductal carcinoma. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common type of breast cancer. This type of breast cancer begins in your breast�s milk ducts and then invades nearby tissue in the breast. Once the breast cancer has spread to the tissue outside your milk ducts, it can begin to spread to other nearby organs and tissue.
Invasive lobular carcinoma. Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) first develops in your breast�s lobules and has invaded nearby tissue.
Other, less common types of breast cancer include:
Paget disease of the nipple. This type of breast cancer begins in the ducts of the nipple, but as it grows, it begins to affect the skin and areola of the nipple.
Phyllodes tumor. This very rare type of breast cancer grows in the connective tissue of the breast. Most of these tumors are benign, but some are cancerous.
Angiosarcoma. This is cancer that grows on the blood vessels or lymph vessels in the breast.
The type of cancer you have helps guide your treatment options and long-term outcome.
Learn more about types of breast cancer."
malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast,"for malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast, inflammatory breast cancer?","Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare but aggressive type of breast cancer. According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), IBC makes up only 1 to 5 percent
of all breast cancer cases.
With this condition, cells block the lymph nodes near the breasts, so the lymph vessels in the breast can�t properly drain. Instead of creating a tumor, IBC causes your breast to swell, look red, and feel very warm. Your breast may appear pitted and thick, like an orange peel.
IBC can be very aggressive and can progress quickly. For this reason, it�s important to contact your doctor right away if you notice any symptoms.
Find out more about IBC and the symptoms it can cause."
malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast,"for malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast, triple-negative breast cancer?","Triple-negative breast cancer is another rare disease type. It affects only about 10 to 15 percent
of people with breast cancer, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS).
To be diagnosed as triple-negative breast cancer, a tumor must have all three of the following characteristics:
It lacks estrogen receptors. These are receptors on the cells that bind, or attach, to the hormone estrogen. If a tumor has estrogen receptors, estrogen can stimulate the cancer to grow.
It lacks progesterone receptors. These receptors are cells that bind to the hormone progesterone. If a tumor has progesterone receptors, progesterone can stimulate the cancer to grow.
It doesn�t have additional human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) proteins on its surface. HER2 is a protein that fuels breast cancer growth.
If a tumor meets these three criteria, it�s labeled triple-negative breast cancer. This type of breast cancer tends to grow and spread more quickly than other types of breast cancer.
Triple-negative breast cancers are difficult to treat because hormonal therapy for breast cancer is not effective.
Learn about treatments and survival rates for triple-negative breast cancer."
malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast,"for malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast, breast cancer stages?","Doctors divide breast cancer into stages based on the size of the tumor and how much it has spread.
Cancers that are large or have invaded nearby tissues or organs are at a higher stage than cancers that are small or still contained in the breast. To stage breast cancer, doctors need to know:
if the cancer is invasive or noninvasive
how large the tumor is
whether the lymph nodes are involved
if the cancer has spread to nearby tissue or organs
Breast cancer has five main stages: stages 0 to 4.
Stage 0 breast cancer
Stage 0 is DCIS. Cancer cells in DCIS remain confined to the ducts in the breast and have not spread into nearby tissue.
Stage 1 breast cancer
Stage 1A. The primary tumor is 2 centimeters (cm) wide or less. The lymph nodes are not affected.
Stage 1B. Cancer is found in nearby lymph nodes. Either there is no tumor in the breast, or the tumor is smaller than 2 cm.
Stage 2 breast cancer
Stage 2A. The tumor is smaller than 2 cm and has spread to 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes, or it�s between 2 and 5 cm and hasn�t spread to any lymph nodes.
Stage 2B. The tumor is between 2 and 5 cm and has spread to 1 to 3 axillary (armpit) lymph nodes, or it�s larger than 5 cm and hasn�t spread to any lymph nodes.
Stage 3 breast cancer
Stage 3A.
The cancer has spread to 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes or has enlarged the internal mammary lymph nodes. The primary tumor can be any size.
Tumors are greater than 5 cm. The cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or any breastbone nodes.
Stage 3B. A tumor has invaded the chest wall or skin and may or may not have invaded up to 9 lymph nodes.
Stage 3C. Cancer is found in 10 or more axillary lymph nodes, lymph nodes near the collarbone, or internal mammary nodes.
Stage 4 breast cancer (metastatic breast cancer)
Stage 4 breast cancer can have a tumor of any size. Its cancer cells have spread to nearby and distant lymph nodes as well as distant organs.
The testing your doctor does will determine the stage of your breast cancer, which will affect your treatment.

According to the ACS
, breast cancer is 70 times less common in Black men than in Black women. It�s 100 times less common in white men than in white women.
That said, the breast cancer that men develop is just as serious as the breast cancer that women develop. It also has the same symptoms. If you�re a man, follow the same monitoring instructions as women and report any changes to breast tissue or new lumps to your doctor.

malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast,"for malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast, breast cancer survival rate?","Breast cancer survival rates vary widely based on many factors.
Two of the most important factors are the type of cancer you have and the stage of the cancer at the time you receive a diagnosis. Other factors that may play a role include:
your age
your gender
your race
the growth rate of the cancer
Research from 2021
shows there�s a higher mortality rate in People of Color with breast cancer diagnoses compared with white people. One reason for this may be healthcare disparities.
The good news is breast cancer survival rates are improving.
According to the ACS
, in 1975, the 5-year survival rate for breast cancer in women was 75.2 percent. But for women diagnosed between 2008 and 2014, it was 90.6 percent.
The 5-year survival rates for breast cancer differ depending on the stage at diagnosis. They range from 99 percent for localized early stage cancers to 27 percent for advanced metastatic cancers.

malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast,"for malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast, diagnosis of breast cancer?","To determine if your symptoms are caused by breast cancer or a benign breast condition, your doctor will do a thorough physical exam in addition to a breast exam. They may also request one or more diagnostic tests to help understand what�s causing your symptoms.
Tests that can help your doctor diagnose breast cancer include:
Mammogram. The most common way to see below the surface of your breast is with an imaging test called a mammogram. Many women ages 40 and older get annual mammograms to check for breast cancer. If your doctor suspects you may have a tumor or suspicious spot, they will also request a mammogram. If an atypical area is seen on your mammogram, your doctor may request additional tests.
Ultrasound. A breast ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the tissues deep in your breast. An ultrasound can help your doctor distinguish between a solid mass, such as a tumor, and a benign cyst.
Your doctor may also suggest tests such as an MRI or a breast biopsy.
Learn about other tests that can be used to detect breast cancer.
If you don�t already have a primary care doctor, you can browse doctors in your area through the Healthline FindCare tool.
Breast biopsy
If your doctor suspects breast cancer based on tests like a mammogram or an ultrasound, they may do a test called a breast biopsy.
During this test, your doctor will remove a tissue sample from the suspicious area to have it tested.
There are several types of breast biopsies. With some of these tests, your doctor uses a needle to take the tissue sample. With others, they make an incision in your breast and then remove the sample.
Your doctor will send the tissue sample to a laboratory. If the sample tests positive for cancer, the lab can test it further to tell your doctor what type of cancer you have.
Learn more about breast biopsies, how to prepare for one, and what to expect."
malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast,"for malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast, breast cancer treatment?","Your breast cancer�s stage, how far it has invaded (if it has), and how big the tumor has grown all play a large part in determining what kind of treatment you�ll need.
To start, your doctor will determine your cancer�s size, stage, and grade. Your cancer�s grade describes how likely it is to grow and spread. After that, you can discuss your treatment options.
Surgery is the most common treatment for breast cancer. Many people have additional treatments, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiation, or hormone therapy.
Surgery
Several types of surgery may be used to remove breast cancer, including:
Lumpectomy. This procedure removes the tumor and some surrounding tissue, leaving the rest of the breast intact.
Mastectomy. In this procedure, a surgeon removes an entire breast. In a double mastectomy, they remove both breasts.
Sentinel node biopsy. This surgery removes a few of the lymph nodes that receive drainage from the tumor. These lymph nodes will be tested. If they don�t have cancer, you may not need additional surgery to remove more lymph nodes.
Axillary lymph node dissection. If lymph nodes removed during a sentinel node biopsy contain cancer cells, your doctor may remove additional lymph nodes.
Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. Even though breast cancer may be present in only one breast, some people elect to have a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. This surgery removes your healthy breast to lower your risk of developing breast cancer again.
Radiation therapy
With radiation therapy, high-powered beams of radiation are used to target and kill cancer cells. Most radiation treatments use external beam radiation. This technique uses a large machine on the outside of the body.
Advances in cancer treatment have also enabled doctors to irradiate cancer from inside the body. According to Breastcancer.org, this type of radiation treatment is called brachytherapy.
To conduct brachytherapy, surgeons place radioactive seeds, or pellets, inside the body near the tumor site. The seeds stay there for a short period of time and work to destroy cancer cells.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is a drug treatment used to destroy cancer cells. Some people may undergo chemotherapy on its own, but this type of treatment is often used along with other treatments, especially surgery.
Some people will have surgery first followed by other treatments, such as chemo or radiation. This is called adjuvant therapy. Others may have chemotherapy first to shrink the cancer, called neoadjuvant therapy, then surgery.
In some cases, doctors prefer to give chemotherapy before surgery. The hope is that the treatment will shrink the tumor, and then the surgery will not need to be as invasive.
Chemotherapy has many unwanted side effects, so discuss your concerns with your doctor before starting treatment.
Hormone therapy
If your type of breast cancer is sensitive to hormones, your doctor may start you on hormone therapy. Estrogen and progesterone, two female hormones, can stimulate the growth of breast cancer tumors.
Hormone therapy works by blocking your body�s production of these hormones or by blocking the hormone receptors on the cancer cells. This action can help slow and possibly stop the growth of your cancer.
Additional medications
Certain treatments are designed to attack specific irregularities or mutations within cancer cells.
For example, Herceptin (trastuzumab) can block your body�s production of the HER2 protein. HER2 helps breast cancer cells grow, so taking a medication to slow the production of this protein may help slow cancer growth.
Your doctor will tell you more about any specific treatment they recommend for you.

malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast,"for malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast, risk factors for breast cancer?","There are several risk factors that increase your chances of getting breast cancer. However, having any of these doesn�t mean you will definitely develop the disease.
Some risk factors can�t be avoided, such as family history. You can change other risk factors, such as smoking. Risk factors for breast cancer include:
Age. Your risk of developing breast cancer increases as you age. Most invasive breast cancers are found in women over 55 years old.
Drinking alcohol. Alcohol use disorder raises your risk.
Having dense breast tissue. Dense breast tissue makes mammograms hard to read. It also increases your risk of breast cancer.
Gender. According to the ACS
, white women are 100 times more likely to develop breast cancer than white men, and Black women are 70 times more likely to develop breast cancer than Black men.
Genes. People who have the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations are more likely to develop breast cancer than people who don�t. Other gene mutations may also affect your risk.
Early menstruation. If you had your first period before you were 12 years old, you have an increased risk of breast cancer.
Giving birth at an older age. People who have their first child after 35 years old have an increased risk of breast cancer.
Hormone therapy. People who took or are taking postmenopausal estrogen and progesterone medications to help reduce their signs of menopause symptoms have a higher risk of breast cancer.
Inherited risk. If a close female relative has had breast cancer, you have an increased risk of developing it. This includes your mother, grandmother, sister, or daughter. If you don�t have a family history of breast cancer, you can still develop breast cancer. In fact, most people who develop it have no family history of the disease.
Late menopause start. People who start menopause after they�re 55 years old are more likely to develop breast cancer.
Never having been pregnant. People who have never become pregnant or carried a pregnancy to full term are more likely to develop breast cancer.
Previous breast cancer. If you have had breast cancer in one breast, you have an increased risk of developing breast cancer in your other breast or in a different area of the previously affected breast."
malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast,"for malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast, breast cancer prevention?","While there are risk factors you can�t control, following a healthy lifestyle, getting regular screenings, and taking any preventive measures your doctor recommends can help lower your risk of developing breast cancer.
Lifestyle factors
Lifestyle factors can affect your risk of breast cancer.
For instance, people who have obesity have a higher risk of developing breast cancer. Maintaining a nutrient-dense diet and getting regular exercise as often as possible could help you lose weight and lower your risk.
According to the American Association for Cancer Research, alcohol misuse also increases your risk. This can be having more than two drinks per day or binge-drinking.
If you drink alcohol, talk with your doctor about what amount they recommend for you.
Breast cancer screening
Having regular mammograms may not prevent breast cancer, but it can help reduce the chance that it will go undetected.
The American College of Physicians (ACP) provides the following general recommendations for women at average risk of breast cancer:
Women ages 40 to 49. An annual mammogram isn�t recommended, but discuss your preferences with your doctor.
Women ages 50 to 74. A mammogram every other year is recommended.
Women 75 years and older. Mammograms are no longer recommended.
The ACP also recommends against mammograms for women with a life expectancy of 10 years or less.
These are only guidelines.
Recommendations from the ACS
differ. According to the ACS, women should:
have the option of receiving annual screenings at 40 years old
begin annual screenings at 45 years old
move to screening every other year at 55 years old
Specific recommendations for mammograms are different for everyone, so talk with your doctor to see if you should get regular mammograms.
Preventive treatment
You may have an increased risk of breast cancer due to hereditary factors.
For instance, if your parent has a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation, you�re at higher risk of having it as well. This significantly raises your risk of breast cancer.
If you�re at risk for this mutation, talk with your doctor about your diagnostic and prophylactic treatment options. You may want to be tested to find out whether you have the mutation.
And if you learn that you do have it, talk with your doctor about any preemptive steps you can take to reduce your risk of developing breast cancer. These steps could include a prophylactic mastectomy, or surgical removal of a breast. You may also consider chemoprophylaxis, or taking medication, such as Tamoxifen, to potentially reduce your breast cancer risk.
In addition to mammograms, breast exams are another way to watch for signs of breast cancer.
Self-exams
Many people do a breast self-examination. It�s best to do this exam once per month, at the same time each month. The exam can help you become familiar with how your breasts usually look and feel so that you�re aware of any changes that occur.
Keep in mind, though, that the ACS
considers these exams to be optional, because current research hasn�t shown a clear benefit of physical exams, whether performed at home or by a doctor.
Breast exam by your doctor
The same guidelines for self-exams provided above are true for breast exams done by your doctor or other healthcare professional. They won�t hurt you, and your doctor may do a breast exam during your annual visit.
If you�re having symptoms that concern you, it�s a good idea to have your doctor do a breast exam. During the exam, your doctor will check both of your breasts for abnormal spots or signs of breast cancer.
Your doctor may also check other parts of your body to see if the symptoms you�re having could be related to another condition.

symptom of diverticulitis. It will most likely occur in the lower left side of your abdomen. It can also develop in the right side of your abdomen.
If you develop any of the above symptoms, it may be a sign of a serious complication from diverticulitis or another condition. Call your doctor right away."
diverticulitis,"for diverticulitis, causes of diverticulitis?","Diverticular disease develops when pouches form along your digestive tract, typically in your colon (large intestine). These pouches (diverticula) can become inflamed and infected, which may occur when feces or partially digested food blocks the opening of the diverticula.
Although there�s no single known cause of diverticular disease, several factors can increase the risk of developing diverticulitis, including
:
genetics
diet
decreased immune function
having obesity
physical inactivity
smoking
changes in the gut microbiome
certain medications, such as steroids"
diverticulitis,"for diverticulitis, what are the complications of diverticulitis??","More than 75 percent
of diverticulitis cases are uncomplicated, leaving about 25 percent to develop complications.
These complications can include:
abscess, an infected pocket that�s filled with pus
phlegmon, an infected area that�s less well-confined than an abscess
fistula, an abnormal connection that can develop between two organs or between an organ and the skin
intestinal perforation, a tear or hole in the intestinal wall that can allow the contents of your colon to leak into your abdominal cavity, causing inflammation and infection
intestinal obstruction, a blockage in your intestine that can stop stool from passing"
diverticulitis,"for diverticulitis, diagnosis of diverticulitis?","To diagnose diverticulitis, your doctor will likely ask about your symptoms, health history, and any medications you take. They�ll likely perform a physical exam to check your abdomen for tenderness.
If they need more information, they may perform a digital rectal exam to check for:
rectal bleeding
pain
masses
other problems
Several other conditions can cause symptoms that are similar to diverticulitis. To rule out other conditions and check for signs of diverticulitis, your doctor might order one or more tests.
Tests can include:
abdominal ultrasound, abdominal MRI scan, abdominal CT scan, or abdominal X-ray to create pictures of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract
colonoscopy to examine the inside of your GI tract; although this takes place after a bout of diverticulosis
stool test to check for infections, such as Clostridium difficile (C. diff)
urine test to check for infections
blood tests to check for signs of inflammation, anemia, or kidney or liver problems
pelvic exam to rule out gynecological problems in people assigned female at birth
pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy in people assigned female at birth
If you have diverticulitis, these exams and tests can help your doctor learn if it�s uncomplicated or complicated.
Using a colonoscopy to diagnose diverticulitis
If you have symptoms of diverticulitis, your doctor might
encourage you to have a colonoscopy once the acute episode resolves. This procedure can help confirm a diagnosis of diverticulitis or another condition that causes similar symptoms, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn�s disease.
During a colonoscopy, your doctor will thread a flexible scope into your rectum and colon. They can use this scope to examine the inside of your colon. They can also use it to collect tissue samples for testing.
To help you feel more comfortable during this procedure, you will be sedated beforehand.
In some cases, your doctor might learn that you have diverticula during a routine colonoscopy. If the diverticula aren�t inflamed, infected, or causing symptoms, you probably won�t need treatment."
diverticulitis,"for diverticulitis, treatment for diverticulitis?","The treatment that your doctor prescribes for diverticulitis will depend on how severe your condition is.
Uncomplicated diverticulitis can typically be treated at home. Your doctor might
encourage you to make changes to your diet. In some cases, they might prescribe medications, including antibiotics.
If you develop complications from diverticulitis, you may need
to visit a hospital for treatment. You may be given fluids and antibiotics through an intravenous (IV) line. Depending on the type of complication, you might need to undergo surgery or another procedure."
diverticulitis,"for diverticulitis, diet and diverticulitis?","There are no particular foods
that everyone with diverticulitis has to avoid. However, you might find that certain foods make your condition better or worse.
As your symptoms improve, your doctor might encourage you to eat more high fiber foods. Some studies
have linked high fiber diets to reduced risk of diverticulitis. Other studies
have examined possible benefits of dietary or supplemental fiber for diverticular disease but are still unsure of the role fiber should play.
Your doctor might also encourage you to limit your consumption of red meat, high-fat dairy products, and refined grain products. A large cohort study
found that people who follow a diet that�s rich in these foods are more likely to develop diverticulitis than people who eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
Diet can play a role in managing diverticulitis and your overall digestive health. Take a moment to learn about some of the foods that might affect your symptoms.
Dietary changes
To give your digestive system a chance to rest and recover, your doctor might suggest
avoiding solid foods and following a clear-liquid diet for a few days.
If your symptoms are mild or have started to improve, you may be able to try eating low-fiber foods until your condition gets better. As your condition improves, your doctor will likely encourage you to add more high-fiber foods to your snacks and meals.
Medication
To reduce pain or discomfort from diverticulitis, your doctor might recommend over-the-counter pain medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol).
If they suspect you have an infection, they�ll likely prescribe
antibiotics to treat it. These can include:
metronidazole (Flagyl, Flagyl ER)
amoxicillin
moxifloxacin
It�s important to take your full course of prescribed antibiotics, even if your symptoms improve after the first few doses.
Other procedures
If you develop a complicated case of diverticulitis that can�t be treated through diet and medication alone, your doctor might recommend
one of the following procedures:
Needle drainage. In this procedure, a needle is inserted into your abdomen to drain an abscess of pus.
Surgery. Surgeries may involve draining an abscess of pus, repairing a fistula, or removing infected segments of the colon."
diverticulitis,"for diverticulitis, surgery for diverticulitis?","If you experience multiple episodes of diverticulitis that can�t be effectively managed with dietary changes and medications, your doctor might recommend
surgery. Surgery may also be used to treat complications from diverticulitis.
There are two main types
of surgery used to treat diverticulitis.
Bowel resection with anastomosis
During a bowel resection with anastomosis, a surgeon removes infected segments of your colon and reattaches the healthy segments to each other.
Bowel resection with colostomy
In a bowel resection with colostomy, the surgeon removes infected sections of your colon and attaches the end of the healthy section to an opening in your abdomen, known as a stoma.
Both procedures can be performed as open surgery or laparoscopic surgery. Learn more about the types of surgery that can be used to treat diverticulitis."
diverticulitis,"for diverticulitis, home remedies for diverticulitis?","Home remedies for diverticulitis mostly consist of making dietary changes, but there are a few other options that may be helpful for symptoms and digestive health.
Some home remedies for diverticulitis include:
Probiotics. Although more research is needed, some studies
have found that certain strains of probiotics might help relieve or prevent symptoms of diverticulitis.
Aromatherapy. Certain essential oils have been shown
to reduce pain, which could be beneficial for managing your symptoms.
Acupuncture. Not only can acupuncture improve
digestive issues like constipation, but some research
also suggests that it could help treat chronic pain.
Herbs. Several herbs possess
powerful anti-inflammatory properties, including ginger, turmeric, and rosemary. However, more research is needed to evaluate the effects of these herbs on diverticulitis specifically.
Read more about the home remedies that might help you manage this condition."
diverticulitis,"for diverticulitis, meckel�s diverticulitis?","Diverticular disease usually affects
adults. In rare cases, babies are born with diverticula. When this happens, it�s known as Meckel�s diverticulum. If the diverticula become inflamed, it�s called Meckel�s diverticulitis.
In some cases, Meckel�s diverticulum doesn�t cause noticeable effects. In other cases, it can cause symptoms such as
:
abdominal pain
nausea
vomiting
bloody stool
bleeding from the rectum
If you suspect your child might have diverticulitis, make an appointment with their doctor. Learn about some of the strategies pediatricians can use to diagnose and manage Meckel�s diverticulum.

diverticulitis,"for diverticulitis, preventing diverticulitis?","More research is needed to learn what causes diverticular disease, including diverticulitis. Currently, experts believe multiple factors play a part. Some potential risk factors may be modified through lifestyle changes.
For example, it might help
to:
try to maintain a moderate body weight
eat a diet that�s high in fiber to help bulk up stools (however, in acute diverticulitis, you may want to avoid fiber)
limit your consumption of saturated fat
get enough vitamin D
get regular exercise if possible
try to avoid cigarette smoke
These prevention strategies can also help promote good overall health."
diverticulitis,"for diverticulitis, risk factors for diverticulitis?","One of the main risk factors for diverticulitis is age. Older people are more likely than younger people to develop diverticulitis. It commonly occurs
in men under 50 and women ages 50 to 70.
People who develop diverticula at a younger age
may be more likely to experience diverticulitis. Younger people are also more likely
to be admitted to a hospital if they have diverticulitis than older people.
According to a review of research
published in 2018, other potential risk factors for diverticulitis include:
Family history
Studies have found that genetics play a role in diverticular disease, with some reports estimating that roughly 40 to 50 percent
of the potential risk of diverticular disease is hereditary.
Low levels of vitamin D
Some studies
suggest that people with higher levels of vitamin D might have a lower risk of getting diverticulitis. More research is needed to understand the potential link between vitamin D and diverticula.
Obesity
Several studies
have found that people with higher body mass index (BMI) and larger waists are at increased risk of diverticulitis.
It�s possible that obesity raises the risk of diverticulitis by changing the balance of bacteria in your gut, but more research is needed to understand the role this plays.
Physical inactivity
Some studies
have found that physically active people are less likely than inactive people to develop diverticulitis. However, this link still needs more research.
Using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or smoking
Regular use of aspirin, ibuprofen, or other NSAIDs may raise your risk of diverticulitis.
People who smoke are also more likely than nonsmokers to develop diverticular disease, including diverticulitis.
According to a 2017 review of research
, there�s no strong evidence that drinking alcohol raises your risk of this disease.
If you drink alcohol, your doctor will likely encourage you to drink in moderation only. Although alcohol consumption might not cause diverticulitis, drinking too much can raise your risk of many other health problems."
diverticulitis,"for diverticulitis, diverticulitis vs. diverticulosis?","If you have diverticula that aren�t infected or inflamed, it�s known as diverticulosis.
In some cases, diverticulosis can cause symptoms such as pain in the abdomen and bloating. When that happens, it�s known as symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD)."
diverticulitis,"for diverticulitis, other forms of diverticulitis?","Diverticula can also develop in your bladder. This happens when the lining of your bladder forms pouches, poking through weak spots in your bladder�s wall.
Sometimes bladder diverticula are present at birth. In other cases, they develop later in life. They can form when your bladder outlet is blocked, or your bladder isn�t working properly due to illness or injury.
If you have bladder diverticula that becomes inflamed, it�s known as bladder diverticulitis. To treat bladder diverticulitis, your doctor might prescribe antibiotics and pain medications. They might also recommend surgery to repair the diverticula.
It�s also possible for diverticulitis in your colon to affect your bladder. In severe cases, you might develop a fistula between your colon and bladder. This is known as a colovesical fistula. Find out what this condition involves.
Diverticula can potentially form in your esophagus, too. This occurs when
pouches develop in your esophageal lining.
Esophageal diverticula are rare. When they do develop, it�s usually slowly and over many years. As they grow, they can cause symptoms or complications such as:
trouble swallowing
pain when swallowing
halitosis, or bad breath
regurgitation of food and saliva
pulmonary aspiration: breathing regurgitated food or saliva into your lungs
aspiration pneumonia: developing a lung infection after breathing in food or saliva
If the diverticula become inflamed, it�s known as esophageal diverticulitis.
To treat esophageal diverticulitis, your doctor might prescribe antibiotics and pain medications. To repair the diverticula, they might recommend surgery. Get more information about your treatment options."
diverticulitis,"for diverticulitis, takeaway?","Diverticulitis is relatively common
in the Western world. In most cases, it can be treated through short-term dietary changes and medication.
If complications develop, they can be serious. If you have complicated diverticulitis, your doctor will likely advise you to get treatment in a hospital. You might need to undergo surgery to repair damage to your colon.
If you have diverticulitis or questions about your risk of developing it, speak with your doctor. They can help you learn how to treat this disease and support your digestive health."
osteomyelitis,what is osteomyelitis? Tell me about osteomyelitis? What kind of disease is osteomyelitis? Can you elaborate on osteomyelitis? What can you tell me about osteomyelitis? Could you describe what osteomyelitis is? I�d like to know more about osteomyelitis. Can you help? What information do you have on osteomyelitis? Could you provide information on osteomyelitis?,"What is a bone infection (osteomyelitis)?
A bone infection, also called osteomyelitis, can result when bacteria or fungi invade a bone.
In children, bone infections most commonly occur in the long bones of the arms and legs. In adults, they usually appear in the hips, spine, and feet.
Bone infections can happen suddenly or develop over a long period of time. If they�re not properly treated, bone infections can leave a bone permanently damaged."
osteomyelitis,"for osteomyelitis, what causes osteomyelitis??","Many organisms, most commonly Staphylococcus aureus, travel through the bloodstream and can cause a bone infection. An infection may begin in one area of the body and spread to the bones via the blood stream.
Organisms that invade a severe injury, deep cut, or wound can also cause infections in nearby bones. Bacteria can enter your system at a surgical site, such as the site of a hip replacement or bone fracture repair. When your bone breaks, bacteria can invade the bone, leading to osteomyelitis.
The most common cause of bone infections is S. aureus bacteria. These bacteria commonly appear on the skin but don�t always cause health problems. However, the bacteria can overpower an immune system that�s weakened by disease and illness. These bacteria can also cause infections in injured areas."
osteomyelitis,"for osteomyelitis, what are the symptoms??","Usually, the first symptom to appear is pain at the infection site. Other common symptoms are:
fever and chills
redness in the infected area
irritability or generally feeling unwell
drainage from the area
swelling in the affected area
stiffness or inability to use an affected limb"
osteomyelitis,"for osteomyelitis, how is osteomyelitis diagnosed??","Your doctor may use several methods to diagnose your condition if you have any symptoms of a bone infection. They will perform a physical exam to check for swelling, pain, and discoloration. Your doctor may order lab and diagnostic tests to determine the exact location and extent of the infection.
It�s likely your doctor will order a blood test to check for the organisms causing the infection. Other tests to check for the bacteria are throat swabs, urine cultures, and stool analyses. The stool culture is an example of a stool analysis.
Another possible test is a bone scan, which reveals the cellular and metabolic activity in your bones. It uses a type of radioactive substance to highlight the bone tissue. If the bone scan doesn�t provide enough information, you may need an MRI scan. In some cases, a bone biopsy may be necessary.
However, a simple bone X-ray may be enough for your doctor to determine the treatment that�s right for you."
osteomyelitis,"for osteomyelitis, what are the treatments for osteomyelitis??","There are several options your doctor may use to treat your bone infection.
Antibiotics may be all that�s necessary to cure your bone infection. Your doctor may administer the antibiotics intravenously, or directly into your veins, if the infection is severe. You may need to take the antibiotics for up to six weeks.
Sometimes bone infections require surgery. If you have surgery, your surgeon will remove the infected bone and dead tissue and drain any abscesses, or pockets of pus.
If you have a prosthesis that�s causing the infection, your doctor may remove and replace it with a new one. Your doctor will also remove any dead tissue near or surrounding the infected area."
osteomyelitis,"for osteomyelitis, who is at risk for osteomyelitis??","There are a few conditions and circumstances that can increase your chances of osteomyelitis, such as:
diabetic disorders that affect blood supply to the bones
intravenous drug use
hemodialysis, which is a treatment used for kidney conditions
trauma to the tissue surrounding the bone
artificial joints or hardware that has become infected
sickle cell disease
peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
smoking"
osteomyelitis,"for osteomyelitis, can you prevent osteomyelitis??","Thoroughly wash and clean any cuts or open wounds in the skin. If a wound/cut does not look like it is healing with home treatment, contact your doctor immediately to have it examined. Clean and dry amputation sites before placing your prosthesis. Also, use the proper footwear and protective equipment to avoid injuries when jumping, running, or participating in sports."
osteomyelitis,"for osteomyelitis, what is the long-term outlook??","Most cases of osteomyelitis are treatable. Chronic infections of the bone, however, may take longer to treat and heal, especially if they require surgery. Treatment should be aggressive because an amputation can become necessary sometimes. The outlook for this condition is good if the infection is treated early."
bacteremia,what is bacteremia? Tell me about bacteremia? What kind of disease is bacteremia? Can you elaborate on bacteremia? What can you tell me about bacteremia? Could you describe what bacteremia is? I�d like to know more about bacteremia. Can you help? What information do you have on bacteremia? Could you provide information on bacteremia?,"If you have bacteremia there are bacteria in your bloodstream. Often, there are no symptoms and the body fights off the bacteria. However, if the immune system cannot cope, it can lead to other serious conditions, such as sepsis.
Bacteremia is when there are bacteria present in your bloodstream. Another term that you may have heard for bacteremia is �blood poisoning,� however this isn�t a medical term.
In some cases, bacteremia can be asymptomatic, meaning there are no symptoms. In other cases, symptoms may be present and there�s a potential risk for serious complications.
Read on to learn more about bacteremia, its symptoms, and how it can be treated."
bacteremia,"for bacteremia, bacteremia versus sepsis?","You may have heard of bacteremia being associated with conditions like septicemia and sepsis. These terms are all closely related, but have slightly different meanings.
Strictly speaking, bacteremia refers to the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream. Bacteria can sometimes enter your bloodstream due to things like cleaning your teeth or undergoing a minor medical procedure.
In many healthy people, bacteremia will clear up on its own without causing illness. However, when an infection is established within the bloodstream, this type of bacteremia is differentiated as septicemia.
If left untreated, a bloodstream infection can lead to more serious complications. One of these is sepsis, which is caused by a strong immune response to the infection.
Sepsis and septic shock can lead to organ failure and even death."
bacteremia,"for bacteremia, causes?","A variety of different bacteria can cause bacteremia. Some of these bacteria can go on to establish an infection in the bloodstream.
Examples of such bacteria include:
Staphylococcus aureus, including MRSA
Escherichia coli (E. coli)
Pneumococcal bacteria
Group A Streptococcus
Salmonella species
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Some common ways in which bacteremia occurs include:
through a dental procedure such as a routine teeth cleaning or through a tooth extraction
from a surgery or procedure
an infection spreading from another part of the body into the bloodstream
via medical devices, particularly in-dwelling catheters and breathing tubes
through severe injuries or burns"
bacteremia,"for bacteremia, symptoms?","Some cases of bacteremia are asymptomatic. In these cases, your immune system will often clear the bacteria without you knowing it.
When bacteremia results in a bloodstream infection, you�ll likely experience symptoms like:
fever
chills
shaking or shivering"
bacteremia,"for bacteremia, diagnosis?","Bacteremia can be diagnosed using a blood culture. To do this, a sample of blood will be taken from a vein in your arm. It will then be sent to a lab to be tested for the presence of bacteria.
Depending on the presumed cause of your infection, your doctor may want to perform additional tests. Some examples include:
sputum culture if you appear to have a respiratory infection or are using a breathing tube
wound culture if you�ve been injured, burned, or have recently undergone surgery
taking samples from in-dwelling catheters or other devices
Imaging tests such as an X-ray, CT scan, or ultrasound may also be used. These can be used to identify potential sites of infection in the body."
bacteremia,"for bacteremia, treatment?","The treatment for a bloodstream infection requires prompt use of antibiotics. This can help to prevent complications like sepsis from occurring. You�ll be hospitalized during treatment.
When bacteria are confirmed in your blood, you�ll likely be started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, typically via IV. This is an antibiotic regimen that should be effective against many different types of bacteria.
During this time, the type of bacteria causing your infection can be identified and antibiotic sensitivity testing can be completed.
With these results, your doctor may adjust your antibiotics to be more specific to what�s causing your infection.
The length of treatment can depend on the cause and severity of the infection. You may need to be on antibiotics for 1 to 2 weeks. IV fluids and other medications may also be given during treatment to help stabilize your condition."
bacteremia,"for bacteremia, risks and complications?","If a bloodstream infection is left untreated, you�re at risk of developing potentially life-threatening complications such as sepsis and septic shock.
Sepsis occurs due to a strong immune response to an infection. This response can trigger changes in your body such as inflammation. These changes can be harmful and can lead to organ damage.
When septic shock occurs, your blood pressure drops dramatically. Organ failure may also occur.
Symptoms of sepsis and septic shock
If a bloodstream infection progresses to sepsis or septic shock, you may also experience more severe symptoms, such as:
quick breathing
rapid heart rate
skin that�s sweaty or feels clammy
a decrease in urination
low blood pressure
changes in mental state, such as feeling confused or disoriented
Risk factors for sepsis and septic shock
Some groups are more at risk for developing sepsis or septic shock from a bloodstream infection. These groups include:
children younger than 1 year old
adults older than 65 years old
people with weakened immune systems
individuals with underlying health conditions like diabetes, kidney disease, or cancer
those that are already very sick or hospitalized
Other potential complications
In addition to sepsis and septic shock, bacteremia can cause other complications to occur. This can happen when the bacteria in your bloodstream travel to other areas of your body.
Additional complications can include:
Meningitis: An inflammation of the tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord.
Pneumonia: A potentially serious respiratory infection.
Endocarditis: An inflammation of the inner lining of the heart.
Osteomyelitis: A bone infection.
Infectious arthritis: An infection that occurs in a joint.
Cellulitis: An infection of the skin.
Peritonitis: An inflammation of the tissue surrounding your abdomen and organs."
bacteremia,"for bacteremia, when to see a doctor?","The signs of a bloodstream infection can often be vague and can mimic other conditions. However, see your doctor promptly if you experience a fever, chills, or shaking that comes on suddenly.
This is particularly true if you�ve been in a situation that may put you at risk for a bloodstream infection. These situations include if you:
are currently fighting an infection elsewhere in your body, such as a urinary tract infection (UTI) or pneumonia
have recently undergone a tooth extraction, medical procedure, or surgery
have recently been hospitalized"
bacteremia,"for bacteremia, the bottom line?","Bacteremia is when there are bacteria present in your bloodstream.
Sometimes, bacteremia can have no symptoms and clear on its own. Other times, it can cause a bloodstream infection that can develop into serious complications.
Many different bacteria can cause bacteremia. It can often occur due to another existing infection, a surgery, or by using a device like a breathing tube.
Timely treatment of bloodstream infections with antibiotics is necessary to prevent complications. If you believe you have a bloodstream infection, be sure to get prompt medical attention."
sickle cell anemia,what is sickle cell anemia? Tell me about sickle cell anemia? What kind of disease is sickle cell anemia? Can you elaborate on sickle cell anemia? What can you tell me about sickle cell anemia? Could you describe what sickle cell anemia is? I�d like to know more about sickle cell anemia. Can you help? What information do you have on sickle cell anemia? Could you provide information on sickle cell anemia?,"What is sickle cell anemia?
Sickle cell anemia, or sickle cell disease (SCD), is a genetic disease of the red blood cells (RBCs). Normally, RBCs are shaped like discs, which gives them the flexibility to travel through even the smallest blood vessels. However, with this disease, the RBCs have an abnormal crescent shape resembling a sickle. This makes them sticky and rigid and prone to getting trapped in small vessels, which blocks blood from reaching different parts of the body. This can cause pain and tissue damage.
SCD is an autosomal recessive condition. You need two copies of the gene to have the disease. If you have only one copy of the gene, you are said to have sickle cell trait."
sickle cell anemia,"for sickle cell anemia, what are the symptoms of sickle cell anemia??","Symptoms of sickle cell anemia usually show up at a young age. They may appear in babies as early as 4 months old, but generally occur around the 6-month mark.
While there are multiple types of SCD, they all have similar symptoms, which vary in severity. These include:
excessive fatigue or irritability, from anemia
fussiness, in babies
bedwetting, from associated kidney problems
jaundice, which is yellowing of the eyes and skin
swelling and pain in hands and feet
frequent infections
pain in the chest, back, arms, or legs"
sickle cell anemia,"for sickle cell anemia, what are the types of sickle cell disease??","Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. It normally has two alpha chains and two beta chains. The four main types of sickle cell anemia are caused by different mutations in these genes.
Hemoglobin SS disease
Hemoglobin SS disease is the most common type of sickle cell disease. It occurs when you inherit copies of the hemoglobin S gene from both parents. This forms hemoglobin known as Hb SS. As the most severe form of SCD, individuals with this form also experience the worst symptoms at a higher rate.
Hemoglobin SC disease
Hemoglobin SC disease is the second most common type of sickle cell disease. It occurs when you inherit the Hb C gene from one parent and the Hb S gene from the other. Individuals with Hb SC have similar symptoms to individuals with Hb SS. However, the anemia is less severe.
Hemoglobin SB+ (beta) thalassemia
Hemoglobin SB+ (beta) thalassemia affects beta globin gene production. The size of the red blood cell is reduced because less beta protein is made. If inherited with the Hb S gene, you will have hemoglobin S beta thalassemia. Symptoms are not as severe.
Hemoglobin SB 0 (Beta-zero) thalassemia
Sickle beta-zero thalassemia is the fourth type of sickle cell disease. It also involves the beta globin gene. It has similar symptoms to Hb SS anemia. However, sometimes the symptoms of beta zero thalassemia are more severe. It is associated with a poorer prognosis.
Hemoglobin SD, hemoglobin SE, and hemoglobin SO
These types of sickle cell disease are more rare and usually don�t have severe symptoms.
Sickle cell trait
People who only inherit a mutated gene (hemoglobin S) from one parent are said to have sickle cell trait. They may have no symptoms or reduced symptoms."
sickle cell anemia,"for sickle cell anemia, who is at risk for sickle cell anemia??","Children are only at risk for sickle cell disease if both parents carry sickle cell trait. A blood test called a hemoglobin electrophoresis can also determine which type you might carry.
People from regions that have endemic malaria are more likely to be carriers. This includes people from:
Africa
India
the Mediterranean
Saudi Arabia"
sickle cell anemia,"for sickle cell anemia, what complications can arise from sickle cell anemia??","SCD can cause severe complications, which appear when the sickle cells block vessels in different areas of the body. Painful or damaging blockages are called sickle cell crises. They can be caused by a variety of circumstances, including:
illness
changes in temperature
stress
poor hydration
altitude
The following are types of complications that can result from sickle cell anemia.
Severe anemia
Anemia is a shortage of RBCs. Sickle cells are easily broken. This breaking apart of RBCs is called chronic hemolysis. RBCs generally live for about 120 days. Sickle cells live for a maximum of 10 to 20 days.
Hand-foot syndrome
Hand-foot syndrome occurs when sickle-shaped RBCs block blood vessels in the hands or feet. This causes the hands and feet to swell. It can also cause leg ulcers. Swollen hands and feet are often the first sign of sickle cell anemia in babies.
Splenic sequestration
Splenic sequestration is a blockage of the splenic vessels by sickle cells. It causes a sudden, painful enlargement of the spleen. The spleen may have to be removed due to complications of sickle cell disease in an operation known as a splenectomy. Some sickle cell patients will sustain enough damage to their spleen that it becomes shrunken and ceases to function at all. This is called autosplenectomy. Patients without a spleen are at higher risk for infections from bacteria such as Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and Salmonella species.
Delayed growth
Delayed growth often occurs in people with SCD. Children are generally shorter but regain their height by adulthood. Sexual maturation may also be delayed. This happens because sickle cell RBCs can�t supply enough oxygen and nutrients.
Neurological complications
Seizures, strokes, or even coma can result from sickle cell disease. They are caused by brain blockages. Immediate treatment should be sought.
Eye problems
Blindness is caused by blockages in the vessels supplying the eyes. This can damage the retina.
Skin ulcers
Skin ulcers in the legs can occur if small vessels there are blocked.
Heart disease and chest syndrome
Since SCD interferes with blood oxygen supply, it can also cause heart problems which can lead to heart attacks, heart failure, and abnormal heart rhythms.
Lung disease
Damage to the lungs over time related to decreased blood flow can result in high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension) and scarring of the lungs (pulmonary fibrosis). These problems can occur sooner in patients who have sickle chest syndrome. Lung damage makes it more difficult for the lungs to transfer oxygen into the blood, which can result in more frequent sickle cell crises.
Priapism
Priapism is a lingering, painful erection that can be seen in some men with sickle cell disease. This happens when the blood vessels in the penis are blocked. It can lead to impotence if left untreated.
Gallstones
Gallstones are one complication not caused by a vessel blockage. Instead, they are caused by the breakdown of RBCs. A byproduct of this breakdown is bilirubin. High levels of bilirubin can lead to gallstones. These are also called pigment stones.
Sickle chest syndrome
Sickle chest syndrome is a severe type of sickle cell crisis. It causes severe chest pain and is associated with symptoms such as cough, fever, sputum production, shortness of breath, and low blood oxygen levels. Abnormalities observed on chest X-rays can represent either pneumonia or death of lung tissue (pulmonary infarction). The long-term prognosis for patients who have had sickle chest syndrome is worse than for those who have not had it."
sickle cell anemia,"for sickle cell anemia, how is sickle cell anemia diagnosed??","All newborns in the United States are screened for sickle cell disease. Prebirth testing looks for the sickle cell gene in your amniotic fluid.
In children and adults, one or more of the following procedures may also be used to diagnose sickle cell disease.
Detailed patient history
This condition often first appears as acute pain in the hands and feet. Patients may also have:
severe pain in the bones
anemia
painful enlargement of the spleen
growth problems
respiratory infections
ulcers of the legs
heart problems
Your doctor may want to test you for sickle cell anemia if you have any of the symptoms mentioned above.
Blood tests
Several blood tests can be used to look for SCD:
Blood counts can reveal an abnormal Hb level in the range of 6 to 8 grams per deciliter.
Blood films may show RBCs that appear as irregularly contracted cells.
Sickle solubility tests look for the presence of Hb S.
Hb electrophoresis
Hb electrophoresis is always needed to confirm the diagnosis of sickle cell disease. It measures the different types of hemoglobin in the blood."
sickle cell anemia,"for sickle cell anemia, how is sickle cell anemia treated??","A number of different treatments are available for SCD:
Rehydration with intravenous fluids helps red blood cells return to a normal state. The red blood cells are more likely to deform and assume the sickle shape if you�re dehydration.
Treating underlying or associated infections is an important part of managing the crisis, as the stress of an infection can result in a sickle cell crisis. An infection may also result as a complication of a crisis.
Blood transfusions improve transport of oxygen and nutrients as needed. Packed red cells are removed from donated blood and given to patients.
Supplemental oxygen is given through a mask. It makes breathing easier and improves oxygen levels in the blood.
Pain medication is used to relieve the pain during a sickle crisis. You may need over-the-counter drugs or strong prescription pain medication like morphine.
(Droxia, Hydrea) helps to increase production of fetal hemoglobin. It may reduce the number of blood transfusions.
Immunizations can help prevent infections. Patients tend to have lower immunity.
Bone marrow transplant has been used to treat sickle cell anemia. Children younger than 16 years of age who have severe complications and have a matching donor are the best candidates.
Home care
There are things you can do at home to help your sickle cell symptoms:
Use heating pads for pain relief.
Take folic acid supplements, as recommended by your doctor.
Eat an adequate amount of fruits, vegetables, and whole-wheat grains. Doing so can help your body make more RBCs.
Drink more water to reduce the chances of sickle cell crises.
Exercise regularly and reduce stress to reduce crises, too.
Contact your doctor immediately if you think you have any type of infection. Early treatment of an infection may prevent a full-blown crisis.
Support groups can also help you deal with this condition."
sickle cell anemia,"for sickle cell anemia, what is the long-term outlook for sickle cell disease??","The prognosis of the disease varies. Some patients have frequent and painful sickle cell crises. Others only rarely have attacks.
Sickle cell anemia is an inherited disease. Talk to a genetic counselor if you�re worried that you might be a carrier. This can help you understand possible treatments, preventive measures, and reproductive options.

upper respiratory infection,what is upper respiratory infection? Tell me about upper respiratory infection? What kind of disease is upper respiratory infection? Can you elaborate on upper respiratory infection? What can you tell me about upper respiratory infection? Could you describe what upper respiratory infection is? I�d like to know more about upper respiratory infection. Can you help? What information do you have on upper respiratory infection? Could you provide information on upper respiratory infection?,"What is acute respiratory infection?
Acute respiratory infection is an infection that may interfere with normal breathing. It can affect just your upper respiratory system, which starts at your sinuses and ends at your vocal chords, or just your lower respiratory system, which starts at your vocal chords and ends at your lungs.
This infection is particularly dangerous for children, older adults, and people with immune system disorders."
upper respiratory infection,"for upper respiratory infection, what are the symptoms of acute respiratory infection??","The symptoms you experience will be different if it�s a lower or upper respiratory infection. Symptoms can include:
congestion, either in the nasal sinuses or lungs
runny nose
cough
sore throat
body aches
fatigue
Call your doctor if you experience:
a fever over 103�F (39�C) and chills
difficulty breathing
dizziness
loss of consciousness"
upper respiratory infection,"for upper respiratory infection, what causes acute respiratory infection??","There are several different causes of acute respiratory infection.
Causes of upper respiratory infection:
acute pharyngitis
acute ear infection
common cold
Causes of lower respiratory infection:
bronchitis
pneumonia
bronchiolitis"
upper respiratory infection,"for upper respiratory infection, who is at risk for acute respiratory infection??","It�s almost impossible to avoid viruses and bacteria, but certain risk factors increase your chances of developing acute respiratory infection.
The immune systems of children and older adults are more prone to being affected by viruses.
Children are especially at risk because of their constant contact with other kids who could be virus carriers. Children often don�t wash their hands regularly. They are also more likely to rub their eyes and put their fingers in their mouths, resulting in the spread of viruses.
People with heart disease or other lung problems are more likely to contract an acute respiratory infection. Anyone whose immune system might be weakened by another disease is at risk. Smokers also are at high risk and have more trouble recovering."
upper respiratory infection,"for upper respiratory infection, how is acute respiratory infection diagnosed??","In a respiratory exam, the doctor focuses on your breathing. They will check for fluid and inflammation in the lungs by listening for abnormal sounds in your lungs when you breathe. The doctor may peer into your nose and ears, and check your throat.
If your doctor believes the infection is in the lower respiratory tract, an X-ray or CT scan may be necessary to check the condition of the lungs.
Lung function tests have been useful as diagnostic tools. Pulse oximetry, also known as pulse ox, can check how much oxygen gets into the lungs. A doctor may also take a swab from your nose or mouth, or ask you to cough up a sample of sputum (material coughed up from the lungs) to check for the type of virus or bacteria causing the disease."
upper respiratory infection,"for upper respiratory infection, how is acute respiratory infection treated??","With many viruses, there are no known treatments. Your doctor may prescribe medications to manage your symptoms while monitoring your condition. If your doctor suspects a bacterial infection, they may prescribe antibiotics."
upper respiratory infection,"for upper respiratory infection, what are potential complications of acute respiratory infection??","Complications of acute respiratory infection are extremely serious and can result in permanent damage and even death. They include:
respiratory arrest, which occurs when the lungs stop functioning
respiratory failure, a rise in CO2 in your blood caused by your lungs not functioning correctly
congestive heart failure"
upper respiratory infection,"for upper respiratory infection, preventing acute respiratory infection?","Most causes of an acute respiratory infection aren�t treatable. Therefore, prevention is the best method to ward off harmful respiratory infections.
Getting the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) and pertussis vaccine will substantially lower your risk of getting a respiratory infection. You may also benefit from influenza vaccination and pneumovax. Talk to your doctor about getting these.
Practice good hygiene:
Wash your hands frequently, especially after you�ve been in a public place.
Always sneeze into the arm of your shirt or in a tissue. Although this may not ease your own symptoms, it will prevent you from spreading infectious diseases.
Avoid touching your face, especially your eyes and mouth, to prevent introducing germs into your system.
Was this helpful?
You should also avoid smoking and make sure you include plenty of vitamins in your diet, such as vitamin C, which helps boost your immune system. Vitamin C is maintained in immune cells, and a deficiency has been linked to higher susceptibility to infection. While research is unclear if Vitamin C can prevent an acute respiratory infection, there is evidence that it can shorten the length of time and or severity of some infections."
hepatitis,what is hepatitis? Tell me about hepatitis? What kind of disease is hepatitis? Can you elaborate on hepatitis? What can you tell me about hepatitis? Could you describe what hepatitis is? I�d like to know more about hepatitis. Can you help? What information do you have on hepatitis? Could you provide information on hepatitis?,"Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. It may be caused by viral infection, alcohol consumption, several health conditions, or even some medications. Treatment varies based on the type and underlying cause.
Hepatitis refers to an inflammatory condition of the liver. It is commonly the result of a viral infection, but there are other possible causes of hepatitis.
These include autoimmune hepatitis and hepatitis that occurs as a secondary result of medications, drugs, toxins, and alcohol. Autoimmune hepatitis is a disease that occurs when your body makes antibodies against your liver tissue.
The five main viral classifications of hepatitis are hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. A different virus is responsible for each type of viral hepatitis.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 354 million
people currently live with chronic hepatitis B and C globally."
hepatitis,"for hepatitis, hepatitis a?","Hepatitis A is the result of an infection with the hepatitis A virus (HAV). This type of hepatitis is an acute, short-term disease."
hepatitis,"for hepatitis, hepatitis b?","The hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes hepatitis B. This is often an ongoing, chronic condition. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that around 826,000
people are living with chronic hepatitis B in the United States and around 257 million people worldwide."
hepatitis,"for hepatitis, hepatitis c?","Hepatitis C comes from the hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV is among the most common bloodborne viral infections in the United States and typically presents as a long-term condition.
According to the CDC, approximately 2.4 million Americans
are currently living with a chronic form of this infection."
hepatitis,"for hepatitis, hepatitis d?","This is a rare form of hepatitis that only occurs in conjunction with hepatitis B infection. The hepatitis D virus (HDV) causes liver inflammation like other strains, but a person cannot contract HDV without an existing hepatitis B infection.
Globally, HDV affects almost 5 percent
of people with chronic hepatitis B."
hepatitis,"for hepatitis, hepatitis e?","Hepatitis E is a waterborne disease that results from exposure to the hepatitis E virus (HEV). Hepatitis E is mainly found in areas with poor sanitation and typically results from ingesting fecal matter that contaminates the water supply.
This disease is uncommon
in the United States, according to the CDC.
Hepatitis E is usually acute but can be particularly dangerous in pregnant women."
hepatitis,"for hepatitis, causes of hepatitis?","Type of hepatitis Common route of transmission
hepatitis A exposure to HAV in food or water
hepatitis B contact with HBV in body fluids, such as blood, vaginal secretions, or semen
hepatitis C contact with HCV in body fluids, such as blood, vaginal secretions, or semen
hepatitis D contact with blood containing HDV
hepatitis E exposure to HEV in food or water
Causes of noninfectious hepatitis
Although hepatitis is most commonly the result of an infection, other factors can cause the condition.
Alcohol and other toxins
Excess alcohol consumption can cause liver damage and inflammation. This may also be referred to as alcoholic hepatitis.
The alcohol directly injures the cells of your liver. Over time, it can cause permanent damage and lead to thickening or scarring of liver tissue (cirrhosis) and liver failure.
Other toxic causes of hepatitis include misuse of medications and exposure to toxins.
Autoimmune system response
In some cases, the immune system mistakes the liver as harmful and attacks it. This causes ongoing inflammation that can range from mild to severe, often hindering liver function. It�s three times more common in women than in men.

hepatitis,"for hepatitis, common symptoms of hepatitis?","If you are living with a chronic form of hepatitis, like hepatitis B and C, you may not show symptoms until the damage affects liver function. By contrast, people with acute hepatitis may present with symptoms shortly after contracting a hepatitis virus.
Common symptoms of infectious hepatitis include:
fatigue
flu-like symptoms
dark urine
pale stool
abdominal pain
loss of appetite
unexplained weight loss
yellow skin and eyes, which may be signs of jaundice"
hepatitis,"for hepatitis, how hepatitis is diagnosed?","It is crucial to understand what is causing hepatitis in order to treat it correctly. Doctors will progress through a series of tests to accurately diagnose your condition.
History and physical exam
To diagnose all forms of hepatitis, your doctor will first take your history to determine any risk factors you may have.
During a physical examination, your doctor may press down gently on your abdomen to see if there�s pain or tenderness. Your doctor may also check for any swelling of the liver and any yellow discoloration in your eyes or skin.
If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here.
Liver function tests
Liver function tests use blood samples to determine how efficiently your liver works.
Abnormal results of these tests may be the first indication that there is a problem, especially if you don�t show any signs on a physical exam of liver disease. High liver enzyme levels may indicate that your liver is stressed, damaged, or not functioning correctly.
Other blood tests
If your liver function tests are abnormal, your doctor will likely order other blood tests to detect the source of the problem.
These tests can determine
if you have infectious hepatitis by checking for the presence of hepatitis viruses or antibodies your body produces to combat them.
Doctors may also use blood tests to check for any signs of autoimmune hepatitis.
Liver biopsy
When diagnosing hepatitis, doctors will also assess your liver for potential damage
. A liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a sample of tissue from your liver.
A medical professional may take this sample through your skin with a needle, meaning there is no need for surgery. They will typically use an ultrasound scan for guidance during this procedure.
This test allows your doctor to determine how infection or inflammation has affected your liver.
Ultrasound
An abdominal ultrasound uses ultrasound waves to create an image of the organs within your abdomen. This test allows your doctor to take a close look at your liver and nearby organs. It can reveal:
fluid in your abdomen
liver damage or enlargement
liver tumors
abnormalities of your gallbladder
Sometimes the pancreas shows up on ultrasound images as well. This can be a useful test in determining the cause of your abnormal liver function."
hepatitis,"for hepatitis, how hepatitis is treated?","Treatment options will vary by the type of hepatitis you have and whether the infection is acute or chronic.
Hepatitis A
Hepatitis A is a short-term illness and may not require treatment. However, if symptoms cause a great deal of discomfort, bed rest may be necessary. In addition, if you experience vomiting or diarrhea, your doctor may recommend a dietary program to maintain your hydration and nutrition.
Hepatitis B
There is no specific treatment program for acute hepatitis B.
However, if you have chronic hepatitis B, you will require
antiviral medications. This form of treatment can be costly, as you may have to continue it for several months or years.
Treatment for chronic hepatitis B also requires regular medical evaluations and monitoring to determine if the virus is responding to treatment.
Hepatitis C
Antiviral medications can treat both acute and chronic forms of hepatitis C.
Typically, people who develop chronic hepatitis C will use a combination of antiviral drug therapies. They may also need further testing to determine the best form of treatment.
People who develop cirrhosis or liver disease due to chronic hepatitis C may be candidates for a liver transplant.
Hepatitis D
The WHO
lists pegylated interferon alpha as a treatment for hepatitis D. However, this medication can have severe side effects. As a result, it�s not recommended for people with cirrhosis liver damage, those with psychiatric conditions, and people with autoimmune diseases.
Hepatitis E
Currently, no specific medical therapies are available
to treat hepatitis E. Because the infection is often acute, it typically resolves on its own.
Doctors will typically advise people with this infection to get adequate rest, drink plenty of fluids, get enough nutrients, and avoid alcohol. However, pregnant women who develop this infection require close monitoring and care.
Autoimmune hepatitis
Corticosteroids, like prednisone or budesonide, are extremely important in the early treatment of autoimmune hepatitis. They�re effective in about 80 percent of people with this condition.
Azathioprine (Imuran), a drug that suppresses the immune system, may also be a part of treatment programs. People may use this with or without steroids.
Other immune-suppressing drugs like mycophenolate (CellCept), tacrolimus (Prograf), and cyclosporine (Neoral) can also replace azathioprine in treatment."
hepatitis,"for hepatitis, tips to prevent hepatitis?","There are vaccines that can help protect against many hepatitis viruses. Minimizing your risk of exposure to substances containing these viruses can also be an important preventive measure.
Vaccines
A vaccine for hepatitis A is available and can help prevent the contraction of HAV. The hepatitis A vaccine is a series of two doses and most children begin vaccination at age 12 to 23 months
. This is also available for adults and can also include the hepatitis B vaccine.
The CDC
recommends hepatitis B vaccinations for all newborns. Doctors typically administer the series of three vaccines over the first 6 months of childhood.
The CDC also recommends the vaccine for all healthcare and medical personnel. Vaccination against hepatitis B can also prevent hepatitis D.
There are currently no vaccines for hepatitis C or E.
Reducing exposure
Hepatitis viruses can transmit from person to person through contact with bodily fluids, water, and foods containing infectious agents. Minimizing your risk of contact with these substances can help to prevent contracting hepatitis viruses.
Practicing effective hygiene is one way to avoid contracting hepatitis A and E. The viruses that cause these conditions can be present
in water. If you�re traveling to a country where there is a high prevalence of hepatitis, you should avoid:
local water
ice
raw or undercooked shellfish and oysters
raw fruit and vegetables
The hepatitis B, C, and D viruses can transmit through contact with bodily fluids containing these infectious agents.
You can reduce your risk
of coming into contact with fluids containing these viruses by:
not sharing needles
not sharing razors
not using someone else�s toothbrush
not touching spilled blood
Hepatitis B and C can carry through sexual intercourse and sexual contact. Using barrier methods, such as condoms and dental dams, during sexual activity can help decrease the risk of infection."
hepatitis,"for hepatitis, complications of hepatitis?","Chronic hepatitis B or C can lead to more severe health problems. Because the virus affects the liver, people with chronic hepatitis B or C are at risk of:
chronic liver disease
cirrhosis
liver cancer
When your liver stops functioning normally, liver failure can occur. Complications of liver failure include:
bleeding disorders
a buildup of fluid in your abdomen, known as ascites
increased blood pressure in portal veins that enter your liver, known as portal hypertension
kidney failure
hepatic encephalopathy, which can involve fatigue, memory loss, and diminished mental abilities
hepatocellular carcinoma, which is a form of liver cancer
death
People with chronic hepatitis B and C should avoid alcohol as it can accelerate liver disease and failure. Certain supplements and medications can also affect liver function. If you have chronic hepatitis B or C, check with your doctor before taking any new medications.

gout,what is gout? Tell me about gout? What kind of disease is gout? Can you elaborate on gout? What can you tell me about gout? Could you describe what gout is? I�d like to know more about gout. Can you help? What information do you have on gout? Could you provide information on gout?,"Gout can be treated and managed with medications and healthy lifestyle habits. Your doctor or nutritionist can help you develop the best treatment strategy for you.
Gout is a general term for a variety of conditions caused by a buildup of uric acid. This buildup usually affects the feet.
If you have gout, you�ll probably feel swelling and pain in the joints of your foot, particularly your big toe. Sudden and intense pain, or gout attacks, can make it feel like your foot is on fire."
gout,"for gout, symptoms of gout?","Some people have too much uric acid in their blood but no symptoms. This is called asymptomatic hyperuricemia.
For acute gout, symptoms come on quickly from the buildup of uric acid crystals in your joint and last for 3 to 10 days.
You�ll have intense pain and swelling, and your joint may feel warm. Between gout attacks, you won�t have any symptoms.
If you don�t treat gout, it can become chronic. Hard lumps called tophi can eventually develop in your joints and the skin and soft tissue surrounding them. These deposits can permanently damage your joints.
Prompt treatment is important to prevent gout from turning chronic."
gout,"for gout, gout pictures?","Warning

gout,"for gout, gout home remedies?","Some home remedies may help lower uric acid levels and prevent gout attacks. The following foods and drinks have been suggested for gout:
tart cherries
magnesium
ginger
diluted apple cider vinegar
celery
nettle tea
dandelion
milk thistle seeds
But these alone may not be enough to manage gout."
gout,"for gout, treatment of gout?","If left untreated, gout can eventually lead to gouty arthritis, which is a more severe form of arthritis. This painful condition can leave your joint permanently damaged and swollen.
The treatment plan your doctor recommends will depend on the stage and severity of your gout.
Medications to treat gout work in one of two ways: They relieve pain and bring down inflammation, or they prevent future gout attacks by lowering uric acid levels.
Drugs to relieve gout pain include:
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin (Bufferin), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve)
colchicine (Colcrys, Mitigare)
corticosteroids
Drugs that prevent gout attacks include:
xanthine oxidase inhibitors, such as allopurinol (Lopurin, Zyloprim) and febuxostat (Uloric)
probenecid (Probalan)
Along with medications, your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes to help manage your symptoms and reduce your risk of future gout attacks. For example, your doctor may encourage you to:
reduce your alcohol intake, if you drink
lose weight, if you�re overweight
quit smoking, if you smoke
In addition a few complementary therapies have also shown promise."
gout,"for gout, gout surgery?","Gout can typically be treated without surgery. But after many years, this condition can damage the joints, tear the tendons, and cause infections in the skin over the joints.
Hard deposits, called tophi, can build up on your joints and in other places, like your ear. These lumps may be painful and swollen, and they can permanently damage your joints.
Three surgical procedures treat tophi:
tophi removal surgery
joint fusion surgery
joint replacement surgery
Which one of these surgeries your doctor recommends depends on the extent of the damage, where the tophi are located, and your personal preferences."
gout,"for gout, causes of gout?","The buildup of uric acid in your blood from the breakdown of purines causes gout.
Certain conditions, such as blood and metabolism disorders or dehydration, make your body produce too much uric acid.
A kidney or thyroid problem, or an inherited disorder, can make it harder for your body to remove excess uric acid.
You�re more likely to get gout if you:
are a middle-aged man or postmenopausal woman
have parents, siblings, or other family members with gout
drink alcohol
take medications such as diuretics and cyclosporine
have a condition like high blood pressure, kidney disease, thyroid disease, diabetes, or sleep apnea
For some people, gout is caused by consuming foods that are high in gout-producing purines."
gout,"for gout, foods to avoid?","Certain foods are naturally high in purines, which your body breaks down into uric acid.
Most people can tolerate high-purine foods. But if your body has trouble releasing excess uric acid, you may want to avoid certain foods and drinks, such as:
red meats
organ meats
certain seafood
alcohol
Sugar-sweetened beverages and foods containing the sugar fructose can also be problematic, even though they don�t contain purines.
Some foods help reduce uric acid levels in the body and are good choices if you have gout.
Gout and alcohol
Alcohol, like red meat and seafood, is high in purines. When your body breaks down purines, the process releases uric acid.
More uric acid increases your risk of having gout. Alcohol can also reduce the rate at which your body removes uric acid.
Not everyone who drinks will develop gout. But a high consumption of alcohol (more than 12 drinks per week) can increase the risk � especially in men. Beer is more likely than liquor to influence the risk.
In surveys, people have reported that drinking alcohol triggers their gout flare-ups."
gout,"for gout, gout diagnosis?","Your doctor can diagnose gout based on a review of your medical history, a physical exam, and your symptoms. Your doctor will likely base your diagnosis on:
your description of your joint pain
how often you�ve experienced intense pain in your joint
how red or swollen the area is
Your doctor may also order a test to check for a buildup of uric acid in your joint. A sample of fluid taken from your joint can show whether it contains uric acid. They may also want to take an X-ray of your joint.
If you have symptoms of gout, you can start with a visit to your primary care doctor. If your gout is severe, you may need to see a specialist in joint diseases.
If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here."
gout,"for gout, gout triggers?","Certain foods, medications, and conditions can set off gout symptoms. You may need to avoid or limit foods and drinks like these, which are high in purines:
red meat, such as pork and veal
organ meats
fish, such as cod, scallops, mussels, and salmon
alcohol
sodas
fruit juice
Some medications you take to manage other conditions increase the level of uric acid in your blood. Talk with your doctor if you take any of these drugs:
diuretics, or water pills
aspirin
blood pressure-lowering medications, such as beta-blockers and angiotensin II receptor blockers
Your health may also be a factor in flare-ups. All of these conditions have been linked to gout:
obesity
diabetes or prediabetes
dehydration
joint injury
infections
congestive heart failure
high blood pressure
kidney disease
Sometimes it can be hard to pinpoint which of these factors is behind your gout attacks. Keeping a diary is one way to track your diet, medications, and health to help identify the cause of your symptoms."
gout,"for gout, gout prevention?","Here are a few steps you can take to help prevent gout:
Limit how much alcohol you drink.
Limit how much purine-rich food, such as shellfish, lamb, beef, pork, and organ meat, you eat.
Eat a low-fat, nondairy diet that�s rich in vegetables.
Maintain a healthy weight.
Avoid smoking.
Exercise regularly.
Stay hydrated.
If you have medical conditions or take medications that raise your risk of gout, ask your doctor how you can lower your risk of gout attacks."
gout,"for gout, gout with tophus?","When uric acid crystals build up in joints for a long time, they produce hard deposits called tophi under the skin. Without treatment, these tophi can damage bone and cartilage and leave the joints permanently disfigured.
Tophi are swollen lumps around the joints that look like knots on a tree trunk. They occur in joints like the fingers, feet, and knees, as well as on the ears. Tophi themselves don�t hurt, but the inflammation they cause can be painful.
Sometimes tophi form in connective tissue outside the joints."
gout,"for gout, is gout painful??","Yes, gout can be painful. In fact, pain in the big toe is often one of the first symptoms people report. The pain is accompanied by more typical arthritis symptoms, such as swelling and warmth in the joints.
Gout pain can vary in severity. Pain in the big toe can be very intense at first. After the acute attack, it may subside to a dull ache.
The pain, as well as swelling and other symptoms, are the result of the body launching a defense (by the immune system) against uric acid crystals in the joints. This attack leads to the release of chemicals called cytokines, which promote painful inflammation."
gout,"for gout, gout essential oils?","Essential oils are plant-based substances used in aromatherapy. Some oils are thought to have anti-inflammatory, pain-relieving, and antibacterial effects.
Some of the essential oils used to treat gout include:
lemongrass oil
celery seed oil
yarrow oil extract
olive leaf extract
Chinese cinnamon
Talk with your doctor before you begin using any essential oil. Be aware that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn�t regulate the purity or quality of essential oils, so research the brand.
Be sure to follow these safety precautions when using essential oils:
Don�t put essential oils directly on your skin. It�s important to dilute them first with a carrier oil such as coconut oil or jojoba oil. For example, for a 3 percent dilution, mix 20 drops of the essential oil with 6 teaspoons of the carrier oil.
Don�t put essential oils in your mouth, since they�re not safe to ingest.
Store essential oils and carrier oils in a cool, dark place, away from sunlight and heat."
gout,"for gout, is gout hereditary??","Gout is at least partly due to heredity. Researchers have found dozens of genes that increase people�s susceptibility to gout, including SLC2A9 and ABCG2. Genes associated with gout affect the amount of uric acid the body holds onto and releases.
Because of genetic factors, gout runs in families. People with a parent, sibling, or other close relative who has gout are more likely to get this condition themselves.
It�s likely that genes only set the stage for gout. Environmental factors, such as diet, actually trigger the disease."
gout,"for gout, takeaway?","Gout can often be successfully treated and managed. Your doctor may prescribe medications that help lower your uric acid levels and reduce inflammation and pain.
Your doctor or nutritionist can also recommend changes in your diet to help prevent flare-ups. Balanced eating and healthy lifestyle habits can help you successfully manage gout."
thrombocytopaenia,what is thrombocytopaenia? Tell me about thrombocytopaenia? What kind of disease is thrombocytopaenia? Can you elaborate on thrombocytopaenia? What can you tell me about thrombocytopaenia? Could you describe what thrombocytopaenia is? I�d like to know more about thrombocytopaenia. Can you help? What information do you have on thrombocytopaenia? Could you provide information on thrombocytopaenia?,"Isolated thrombocytopenia is a condition where your platelet levels are low, but other blood cell levels are within a typical range. It�s rare and potentially dangerous.
Thrombocytopenia is also known as low platelet count. It�s a condition that occurs when your blood doesn�t have enough cells called platelets (or thrombocytes).
Platelets are cells that form clots in response to damage in your blood vessels. A low platelet count can lead to an increased risk of bleeding or bruising.
Thrombocytopenia frequently goes together with other blood conditions, like anemia. But isolated thrombocytopenia occurs when your platelet levels are low, but other blood cell levels are within a typical range.
Isolated thrombocytopenia is relatively rare. Although we don�t know exactly how many people in the world are affected by this condition, some doctors estimate that it occurs in around 5%
of the people they treat with thrombocytopenia.
Untreated isolated thrombocytopenia can be dangerous because of the risk of internal bleeding that can be fatal. Read on to learn more about isolated thrombocytopenia, including its causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options."
thrombocytopaenia,"for thrombocytopaenia, what are the symptoms of isolated thrombocytopenia??","The symptoms of isolated thrombocytopenia can vary depending on how low your platelet count is. Some people may not experience any symptoms, while others may have frequent bleeding or bruising.
Symptoms of isolated thrombocytopenia can include
:
easy bruising
nosebleeds
bleeding gums
bleeding from cuts that doesn�t stop for a long time
petechiae, or small red or purple dots on the skin
purpura, or purple or brown bruise-like spots on the skin
heavy menstrual bleeding
In more severe cases you may have internal bleeding. Symptoms of internal bleeding include:
blood in the stool or tarry stools
blood in urine
vomiting blood"
thrombocytopaenia,"for thrombocytopaenia, isolated thrombocytopenia causes?","Isolated thrombocytopenia can be chronic (long-term) and acute (short-term). These conditions can have different causes.
Acute isolated thrombocytopenia can be caused by:
autoimmune thrombocytopenia
certain medications, like quinine or chemotherapy drugs
pregnancy
Chronic isolated thrombocytopenia, on the other hand, can result from:
liver conditions like nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
viral infections like HIV or viral hepatitis
certain autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis
some antibiotics and other drugs"
thrombocytopaenia,"for thrombocytopaenia, potential complications of isolated thrombocytopenia?","Complications of isolated thrombocytopenia include internal bleeding of the brain or the intestines. Left untreated, these complications can be fatal.
Isolated thrombocytopenia in pregnancy
Mild thrombocytopenia can happen in pregnancy, and it�s usually not a cause for concern. But in rare cases, thrombocytopenia can be severe. Very low platelet levels can have serious complications for both mom and baby, like:
dangerously heavy bleeding during and after delivery
inability to get an epidural due to potential complications
premature delivery"
thrombocytopaenia,"for thrombocytopaenia, when to contact a doctor?","It�s important to contact a healthcare professional if you experience any symptoms of thrombocytopenia, like:
frequent nosebleeds
bruising
wounds that don�t stop bleeding
any signs of internal bleeding
In addition, be sure to speak with your doctor if you�ve been diagnosed with isolated thrombocytopenia and your symptoms are getting worse, or you�ve developed new symptoms."
thrombocytopaenia,"for thrombocytopaenia, isolated thrombocytopenia diagnosis?","The diagnosis of isolated thrombocytopenia typically begins with a physical exam. If your doctor suspects a low platelet count, they may check your skin for petechia or purpura. They�ll also ask about your medical history to look for potential causes of this condition.
Your doctor will then run several lab tests. One of the first tests will likely be a blood test called complete blood count (CBC). This test measures the levels of all cells in your blood. It can help your doctor figure out if your platelets are low and if other cells are affected as well.
If only platelets are affected, they�ll likely diagnose you with isolated thrombocytopenia.
Other tests may include:
abdominal ultrasound to look at your spleen
bone marrow biopsy or aspiration
other tests that might help with identifying the cause of your condition"
thrombocytopaenia,"for thrombocytopaenia, isolated thrombocytopenia treatment?","Treatment of isolated thrombocytopenia depends on the severity of your condition and the underlying cause. If your platelet count is only slightly low and there are no symptoms, you may not need any treatment. Instead, your doctor will likely monitor you to ensure your condition doesn�t worsen.
But you might need treatment if your platelet count is significantly low or you have symptoms. Treatment may include medications that suppress your immune system, for example:
corticosteroids
immunoglobulins
other immunosuppressants
In some cases, if your condition is severe or if medications don�t work as expected, a procedure called a splenectomy may be necessary. This procedure involves removing the spleen.
Be sure to discuss the potential benefits and risks of your treatment with your doctor."
thrombocytopaenia,"for thrombocytopaenia, takeaway?","Isolated thrombocytopenia is a blood disorder that occurs when the body doesn�t have enough platelets while other blood cells are at typical levels. It can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term).
Treatment of isolated thrombocytopenia usually involves using immunosuppressive medications. But some people may need to have their spleen surgically removed.
Not everyone with isolated thrombocytopenia has symptoms or needs treatment. But people with very low platelet levels may need treatment to prevent serious complications, like internal bleeding. Severe isolated thrombocytopenia may be especially dangerous in pregnancy.
Speak with your doctor if you have any symptoms of this condition or questions about management."

Could you describe what hypoglycemia is? I�d like to know more about hypoglycemia. Can you help? What information do you have on hypoglycemia? Could you provide information on hypoglycemia?,"You may get low blood sugar due eating too few carbohydrates or taking certain medications. Treatment may include easily digestible carbs, medication, or urgent medical care, depending on severity.
Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) happens when your blood sugar (glucose) drops below the typical range. If your blood sugar drops too low, you may need immediate treatment.
Hypoglycemia is more common
in people with diabetes.
This article will take a closer look at hypoglycemia, as well as the symptoms and treatment and how to prevent your blood sugar from dropping too low."
hypoglycemia,"for hypoglycemia, what is hypoglycemia??","Hypoglycemia occurs when your blood sugar drops below 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Blood sugar is also known as blood glucose. If your cells don�t get glucose, your body can�t perform its typical functions.
If you take insulin for diabetes, you may be more likely to develop hypoglycemia.
Even a short-term decrease in blood glucose can cause problems. In this situation, immediate treatment for low blood sugar levels can help prevent more serious symptoms such as loss of consciousness."
hypoglycemia,"for hypoglycemia, what are the symptoms of hypoglycemia??","Illustration by Sophia Smith
Symptoms of low blood sugar can occur suddenly. They may include:
pale skin
unexplained fatigue
hunger
shaking
sweating
dizziness
rapid heartbeat
mood changes
irritability or anxiety
headache
difficulty sleeping
skin tingling
blurry vision
trouble thinking clearly or concentrating
loss of consciousness, seizure, or coma
Hypoglycemia unawareness
Some people may have low blood sugar without any symptoms. This is called hypoglycemia unawareness.
If you have this condition, your blood sugar can drop without you noticing it. Without immediate treatment, you may faint, experience a seizure, or even go into a coma.
If you have hypoglycemia unawareness, you may need to check your blood sugar levels more regularly. A doctor may recommend a continuous glucose monitor, a device that can alert you to changes in your blood sugar levels.
What to do if you have low blood sugar symptoms
If you have diabetes and are experiencing mild to moderate hypoglycemia symptoms, you need to immediately eat or drink 15 grams (g) of easily digestible carbohydrates.
Examples of easily digestible carbohydrates
1/2 cup of juice or regular (non-diet) soda
1 tablespoon of honey
4 or 5 saltines
3 or 4 pieces of hard candy or glucose tablets
1 tablespoon of sugar

Very low blood sugar is a medical emergency. If you or someone else with diabetes is experiencing severe symptoms, such as loss of consciousness, it�s important to administer a medication called glucagon and contact local emergency services immediately.
If you�re at risk for low blood sugar, a doctor can prescribe glucagon.
Never give an unconscious person anything by mouth, as it could cause choking. If you have diabetes, make sure your family and friends know not to do this if you lose consciousness."
hypoglycemia,"for hypoglycemia, what causes hypoglycemia??","Low blood sugar can occur for a number of reasons. It�s usually a side effect of diabetes treatment.
Possible causes in people with diabetes
If you have diabetes, your blood sugar levels may sometimes become too low as a result of your treatment. Hypoglycemia may also occur if you:
take too much medication, including insulin or medications that increase insulin production
plan to eat a big meal and take your medication accordingly but then do not eat enough
skip meals or fast
eat less than usual
eat later than usual but take your medication at the usual time
engage in unplanned, excessive physical activity without eating enough
drink alcohol, which can affect how your body manages your blood sugar levels
become sick and cannot keep food down
Blood sugar regulation
Blood sugar regulation aims to prevent spikes and drops by keeping your blood sugar levels stable.
If you have untreated diabetes or are unaware that you have diabetes, you may experience low or high blood sugar. You can help manage your blood sugar levels with dietary changes, regular physical activity, and medication if needed.
Hypoglycemia after meals
You may develop low blood sugar levels after eating due to the composition of your meals. Contributing factors can include:
consumption of too few carbohydrates
consumption of too few carbohydrates without a reduction in the amount of insulin you take
consumption of more carbohydrates from liquids than usual, as your body absorbs them more quickly than solids
the amounts of other nutrients, such as fat, protein, and fiber, you are consuming
Possible causes in people without diabetes
Even if you don�t have diabetes, you may experience low blood sugar, though it is less common.
Possible causes of low blood sugar in people who don�t have diabetes include:
certain medications, such as quinine
some medical conditions, such as hepatitis and kidney disorders
a tumor that produces excess insulin
severe illnesses such as cerebral malaria and sepsis
endocrine disorders such as adrenal gland deficiency
anorexia nervosa"
hypoglycemia,"for hypoglycemia, how is hypoglycemia diagnosed??","If you suspect you have low blood sugar, it�s important to check your blood sugar right away. If you don�t have a blood glucose meter and you�re taking diabetes medications that increase insulin, talk with your doctor about getting a meter.
If you experience low blood sugar a few times per week, talk with a doctor right away to find out why. They may begin your visit by requesting your medical history, asking questions about your eating habits, and learning more about your symptoms.
If you don�t have diabetes but suspect you have hypoglycemia, talk with a doctor about your symptoms. A doctor will use three criteria, sometimes referred to as Whipple�s triad, to diagnose low blood sugar:
Signs and symptoms of low blood sugar: A doctor may require you to fast (abstain from drinking and eating for an extended period) so they can observe signs and symptoms.
Documentation of low blood sugar when your signs and symptoms occur: A doctor will order a blood test to analyze your blood sugar levels in a laboratory.
Disappearance of the signs and symptoms of low blood sugar: A doctor will want to know whether the signs and symptoms go away when your blood sugar levels are raised.
The doctor may send you home with a blood glucose meter to track your blood sugar over time at home. They may ask that you check your blood sugar at certain times of the day, such as after waking up and after eating meals.
If you need help finding a primary care doctor, check out our FindCare tool.
How to check your blood sugar at home
To perform a blood sugar test, you will need to prick your finger with a lancet (provided in a blood glucose test kit). You�ll put a small sample of blood from this onto a strip inserted into the blood glucose meter.
Before you check your blood sugar at home, it�s important to find out from a doctor what a healthy blood sugar range is for you. The doctor will determine this range based on factors such as:
the type of diabetes you have
how long you�ve had diabetes
your age
whether you have any other chronic health conditions
If you don�t have a blood glucose meter on hand and are experiencing symptoms of low blood sugar with diabetes, your symptoms may be enough to diagnose low blood sugar."
hypoglycemia,"for hypoglycemia, how is hypoglycemia treated??","You can treat hypoglycemia by raising your blood sugar. It is important to treat low blood sugar as soon as possible.
The American Diabetes Association recommends consuming at least 15 g of carbohydrates to increase your blood sugar. Options include:
hard candies
non-diet soda or juice
honey or table sugar
jelly beans or gumdrops
fresh or dried fruit
You can also take glucose tablets to rapidly raise your blood sugar if it�s low, but it�s important to determine how many grams of carbs are in each tablet before taking them.
Wait 15 minutes after eating or taking a glucose tablet and check your blood sugar again. If your blood sugar is not above 70 mg/dL, eat another 15 g of carbohydrates or take another dose of glucose tablets. Repeat this until your blood sugar level starts to rise.
Be sure not to overeat. This could lead to blood sugar levels that are too high.
If your blood sugar remains unresponsive, contact a doctor or emergency services right away. Symptoms of low blood sugar usually get worse if left untreated and can become life threatening.
If you are at risk for low blood sugar, a doctor may recommend a glucagon kit. This medication raises your blood sugar levels.
You may also want to talk with people you are in frequent contact with about how to care for you if your blood sugar drops too low. This includes:
recognizing low blood sugar symptoms
knowing how to use the glucagon kit
calling 911 or your local emergency services if you lose consciousness
Wearing a medical identification bracelet can help emergency responders care for you properly if you need urgent medical attention.
You may need to make an appointment with a doctor if you have diabetes and experience low blood sugar levels often or if you have symptoms but don�t have diabetes."
hypoglycemia,"for hypoglycemia, complications from spells of hypoglycemia?","Mildly low blood sugar levels are somewhat common for people with diabetes. However, severely low blood sugar levels can be life threatening. Complications may include:
seizures
nervous system damage
loss of consciousness
death
Avoid driving if you are experiencing low blood sugar, as it can increase your risk of having an accident."
hypoglycemia,"for hypoglycemia, how can episodes of hypoglycemia be prevented??","There are several ways you can prevent low blood sugar.
Check your blood sugar often
Regularly checking your blood sugar level can help you keep it in your target range. If you�ve had low blood sugar episodes in the past, you may want to check your blood sugar levels before driving or operating machinery.
A doctor can advise you on how often to check your blood sugar.
Snack wisely
Consider having a snack before you leave your home if you know it will be more than 5 hours until your next full meal or if your blood sugar levels are lower than 100 mg/dL.
It�s a good idea to keep carbohydrate-rich snacks on hand at all times in case your blood sugar dips while you�re out.
Fuel your body during exercise
Exercise uses up energy, so it can quickly cause your blood sugar to drop if you haven�t eaten enough beforehand. Check your blood sugar 1�2 hours before exercising to make sure it�s within your target range.
If it�s too low, eat a small meal or carbohydrate-rich snack.
If you plan to exercise for an hour or longer, consume additional carbohydrates during your workout. Exercise gels, sports drinks, granola bars, and even candy bars can provide your body with a quick burst of glucose during exercise.
Healthcare professionals can come up with the right program for you.
Your blood sugar may drop for up to 24 hours after moderate to intense exercise. Doctors recommend checking your blood sugar level immediately after exercise and then every 2�4 hours until you go to sleep. Avoid intense exercise immediately before bed.
Follow guidance around medications
If you follow a meal plan or take medications that increase your insulin level, it�s important to stick to the plan your doctor has prescribed to help prevent low blood sugar.
Not eating the right foods or taking the right medications at the correct times can cause your blood sugar to drop. Check in often with your doctor so they can adjust your treatment plan if and when necessary.
Q:
I just started a weight loss program, and I keep having a big drop in my blood sugar levels after breakfast. Any advice?
� From our Facebook community
A:
It sounds like you may be experiencing something called reactive hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar after eating a meal, which is most likely due to a change in diet.
To manage this problem, I recommend consistent and frequent meals and snacks every 3�4 hours that are a mix of high fiber carbohydrates, fat, and protein.
Eating high fiber carbohydrates is important because they provide the sugar the body needs, but they are also what causes the body to release insulin.
Make sure to add some protein or fat to all of your meals and snacks. Protein and fat can help slow the digestion of carbohydrates, which helps manage the release of insulin and allows for the slow and steady digestion of carbs.
Be sure to discuss any changes to your diet with your primary care physician.

What can you tell me about pneumonia aspiration? Could you describe what pneumonia aspiration is? I�d like to know more about pneumonia aspiration. Can you help? What information do you have on pneumonia aspiration? Could you provide information on pneumonia aspiration?,"Aspiration pneumonia is a complication of pulmonary aspiration. Pulmonary aspiration is when you inhale food, stomach acid, or saliva into your lungs.
You can also aspirate food that travels back up from your stomach to your esophagus. All of these things may carry bacteria that affect your lungs. Healthy lungs can clear up on their own. If they don�t, pneumonia can develop as a complication."
pneumonia aspiration,"for pneumonia aspiration, what are the symptoms of aspiration pneumonia??","Someone with aspiration pneumonia may show symptoms of poor oral hygiene and throat clearing or wet coughing after eating. Other symptoms of this condition include:
chest pain
shortness of breath
wheezing
fatigue
blue discoloration of the skin
cough, possibly with green sputum, blood, or a foul odor
difficulty swallowing
bad breath
excessive sweating
Anyone exhibiting these symptoms should contact their doctor. Let them know if you�ve recently inhaled any food or liquids. It�s especially critical that children under 2 years of age or adults over the age of 65 get medical attention and a quick diagnosis.
Don�t hesitate to go to the doctor if you�re coughing up colored sputum or have a lingering fever over 102�F (38�C) in addition to the symptoms mentioned above."
pneumonia aspiration,"for pneumonia aspiration, what causes aspiration pneumonia??","Pneumonia from aspiration can occur when your defenses are impaired and the aspirated contents have a large amount of harmful bacteria.
You can aspirate and develop pneumonia if your food or drink �goes down the wrong way.� This may happen even if you can swallow normally and have a regular gag reflex. In that case, most of the time you�ll be able to prevent this by coughing. Those who have impaired coughing ability, however, may not be able to. This impairment may be due to:
neurological disorders
throat cancer
medical conditions like myasthenia gravis or Parkinson�s disease
excessive use of alcohol or prescription or illegal drugs
use of sedatives or anesthesia
a weakened immune system
esophageal disorders
dental problems that interfere with chewing or swallowing"
pneumonia aspiration,"for pneumonia aspiration, who is at risk for aspiration pneumonia??","Risk factors for aspiration pneumonia include people with:
impaired consciousness
lung disease
seizure
stroke
dental problems
dementia
swallowing dysfunction
impaired mental status
certain neurologic diseases
radiation therapy to the head and neck
heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux)
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)"
pneumonia aspiration,"for pneumonia aspiration, how is aspiration pneumonia diagnosed??","Your doctor will look for signs of pneumonia during a physical exam, such as a decreased flow of air, rapid heart rate, and a crackling sound in your lungs. Your doctor may also run a series of tests to confirm pneumonia. These may include:
chest X-ray
sputum culture
complete blood count (CBC)
arterial blood gas
bronchoscopy
computed tomography (CT) scan of your chest area
blood culture
Because pneumonia is a serious condition, it requires treatment. You should have some of your test results within 24 hours. Blood and sputum cultures will take three to five days."
pneumonia aspiration,"for pneumonia aspiration, how is aspiration pneumonia treated??","Treatment depends on the severity of your pneumonia. Outcomes and duration of treatment depend on your general health, preexisting conditions, and hospital policies. Treating severe pneumonia may require hospitalization. People with trouble swallowing may need to stop taking food by mouth.
Your doctor will prescribe antibiotics for your condition. Things your doctor will ask before prescribing antibiotics:
Were you recently hospitalized?
What is your overall health?
Have you used antibiotics recently?
Where do you live?
Make sure to take the antibiotics for the entire length of the prescription period. This period can vary from one to two weeks.
You may also need supportive care if aspiration pneumonia causes breathing problems. Treatment includes supplemental oxygen, steroids, or help from a breathing machine. Depending on the cause of chronic aspiration, you may require surgery. For example, you may get surgery for a feeding tube if you have swallowing problems that don�t respond to treatment."
pneumonia aspiration,"for pneumonia aspiration, how can aspiration pneumonia be prevented??","Prevention tips
Avoid behaviors that can lead to aspiration, such as excessive drinking.
Be careful when taking medications that can make you feel drowsy.
Receive proper dental care on a regular basis.

Your doctor may recommend a swallow evaluation by a licensed speech pathologist or swallow therapist. They can work with you on swallowing strategies and throat muscle strengthening. You may also need to change your diet.
Surgery risk: Follow your doctor�s orders about fasting to lower the chance of vomiting under anesthesia."
pneumonia aspiration,"for pneumonia aspiration, what can be expected in the long term??","Many people who have aspiration pneumonia also have other diseases that affect swallowing. This can result in a longer recovery period. Your outlook depends on:
how much of your lungs have been affected
the severity of the pneumonia
the type of bacteria causing the infection
any underlying medical condition that compromises your immune system or your ability to swallow
Pneumonia can cause long-term problems like a lung abscess or permanent scarring. Some people will develop acute respiratory failure, which can be fatal.
Aspiration pneumonia has been shown to increase mortality
in people who are hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia if they aren�t in an intensive care unit (ICU)."
pneumonia aspiration,"for pneumonia aspiration, takeaway?","Aspiration pneumonia is a lung infection caused by inhaled oral or gastric contents. It can become serious if left untreated. Treatment involves antibiotics and supportive care for breathing.
Your outlook depends on your state of health prior to the event, the type of foreign material that is aspirated into your lungs, and any other conditions you might have. Most people (79 percent) will survive aspiration pneumonia. Of the 21 percent of people who won�t survive, mortality is often due to a preexisting condition that led them to choose to have a DNR (do not resuscitate) or DNI (do not intubate) document.
Contact a doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of pneumonia, especially in an older adult or infant. To diagnose aspiration pneumonia, your doctor will order tests to look at lung health and ability to swallow."

I�d like to know more about colitis. Can you help? What information do you have on colitis? Could you provide information on colitis?,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Symptoms can range from mild to severe. In some cases, you may not have any symptoms. Treatment focuses on managing or reducing symptoms.
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD comprises a group of diseases that affect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
UC occurs when the lining of your large intestine (also called the colon), rectum, or both become inflamed.
This inflammation produces tiny sores called ulcers on the lining of your colon. Inflammation usually begins in the rectum and spreads upward. It can involve your entire colon.
The inflammation causes your bowel to move its contents rapidly and empty frequently. As cells on the surface of the lining of your bowel die, ulcers form. The ulcers may cause bleeding and discharge of mucus and pus.
While this condition affects people of all ages, most people develop UC between ages 15 and 30 years old, according to the American Gastroenterological Association. After 50 years old, there�s another small increase in diagnosis of IBD, usually in men."
colitis,"for colitis, ulcerative colitis symptoms?","The seriousness of UC symptoms varies among people who have the condition. The symptoms can also change over time.
People diagnosed with UC may experience periods of mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. This is called remission. However, symptoms can return and become severe. This is called a flare-up.
Common symptoms of UC include:
abdominal pain
increased abdominal sounds
bloody stools
diarrhea
fever
rectal pain
weight loss
malnutrition
UC may cause additional symptoms, such as:
joint pain
joint swelling
nausea and decreased appetite
skin problems
mouth sores
eye inflammation"
colitis,"for colitis, ulcerative colitis causes?","Researchers believe that UC may be the result of an overactive immune system. However, it�s unclear why some immune systems respond by attacking the large intestines, and others don�t.
Factors that may play a role in who develops UC include:
Genes. You may inherit a gene from a parent that increases your chance of having UC.
Other immune disorders. If you have one type of immune disorder, your chance of developing a second is higher.
Environmental factors. Bacteria, viruses, and antigens may trigger your immune system."
colitis,"for colitis, types of ulcerative colitis?","UC can be categorized according to the parts of the GI tract that it affects.
Ulcerative proctitis. In ulcerative proctitis, only the rectum is inflamed. It�s considered a mild form of UC.
Left-sided colitis. Left-sided colitis causes inflammation in the area between the splenic flexure (near the upper part of the colon, where it bends) and the last section of the colon. The last section of the colon, known as the distal colon, includes the descending colon and sigmoid colon. Left-sided colitis is also known as distal ulcerative colitis.
Proctosigmoiditis. Proctosigmoiditis is a form of left-sided colitis. It causes inflammation in the rectum and sigmoid colon.
Extensive colitis. Extensive colitis, also known as pancolitis, causes inflammation throughout the entire colon. It�s considered a severe form of UC."
colitis,"for colitis, ulcerative colitis diagnosis?","Different tests can help a doctor diagnose UC. UC mimics other bowel diseases such as Crohn�s disease. A doctor will order multiple tests to rule out other conditions.
Tests to diagnose UC often include:
Blood tests. Blood tests are often useful in the diagnosis of UC. A complete blood count looks for signs of anemia (a low red blood cell count). Other tests indicate inflammation, such as a high level of C-reactive protein and a high sedimentation rate. A doctor may also order specialized antibody tests.
Stool test. A doctor examines your stool for certain inflammatory markers, blood, bacteria, and parasites.
CT scan. This is a specialized X-ray of your abdomen and pelvis.
Endoscopy. A doctor uses a flexible tube to examine your stomach, esophagus, and small intestine.
Biopsy. A surgeon removes a tissue sample from your colon for analysis.
Flexible sigmoidoscopy. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is a type of endoscopy. During this test, a doctor inserts a long, flexible tube into your rectum so that they can examine it, the sigmoid colon, and part of the descending colon. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is also known as sigmoidoscopy.
Colonoscopy. During a colonoscopy, a doctor inserts a lighted scope called a colonoscope into your rectum to examine the inside of your colon. It�s also a type of endoscopy.
Were you recently diagnosed? Here�s what you need to know about treating and living with UC."
colitis,"for colitis, ulcerative colitis and colonoscopy?","Doctors can use a colonoscopy to diagnose UC or determine the severity of the condition.
Before the procedure, a doctor will likely instruct you to reduce solid foods and switch to a liquid-only diet. Then you�ll fast for a period of time before the procedure.
Typical colonoscopy prep involves taking a laxative the evening before the procedure, too. This helps eliminate any waste still in the colon and rectum. Doctors can examine a clean colon more easily.
During the procedure, you�ll lie on your side. Your doctor will give you a sedative to help you relax and prevent any discomfort.
Once the medication takes effect, the doctor will insert a colonoscope into your anus. This device is long and flexible so it can move easily through your GI tract. The colonoscope also has a camera attached so your doctor can see inside the colon.
During the exam, the doctor will look for signs of inflammation and check for precancerous growth called polyps. The doctor may also perform a biopsy. The tissue can be sent to a laboratory for further examination.
If you�ve been diagnosed with UC, a doctor may conduct periodic colonoscopies to monitor inflammation, damage to your intestines, and healing progress.
A colonoscopy is an important tool in detecting colorectal cancer as well. Find out why that�s so important for people who�ve been diagnosed with UC."
colitis,"for colitis, when to see a doctor?","If you�ve been diagnosed with UC, see a doctor if you experience symptoms such as:
severe abdominal pain or cramping
severe rectal bleeding
chronic diarrhea that�s difficult to treat
high fever
swelling of areas such as the skin or joints
dehydration
These symptoms are sometimes associated with UC complications.
If you haven�t been diagnosed with UC, see a doctor if you experience multiple symptoms of the condition. They can help determine whether you may have UC or another bowel disease."
colitis,"for colitis, ulcerative colitis treatment?","UC is a chronic condition. The goal of treatment is to reduce the inflammation that causes your symptoms to prevent flare-ups and have longer periods of remission.
Medication
Which medication you�ll take will depend on your specific situation, including how severe your symptoms are.
For mild symptoms, your doctor may prescribe a medication to reduce inflammation and swelling. This will help alleviate many symptoms.
These types of medications include 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA drugs) such as:
mesalamine (Asacol HD, Lialda)
sulfasalazine (Azulfidine)
balsalazide (Colazal)
olsalazine (Dipentum)
Some people may need corticosteroids to help reduce inflammation, but these can have adverse effects, so doctors try to limit their use. If an infection is present, you may need antibiotics.
If you have moderate to severe symptoms, a doctor may prescribe a type of medication known as a biologic. Biologics are made from antibodies and help block inflammation. Taking these can help prevent a symptom flare-up.
Effective options for most people include:
adalimumab (Humira)
golimumab (Simponi)
infliximab (Remicade)
tofacitinib (Xeljanz)
ustekinumab (Stelara)
vedolizumab (Entyvio)
A doctor may also prescribe an immunomodulator. These change the way the immune system works. Examples include methotrexate, 5-ASA drugs, and thiopurine drugs. However, current guidelines don�t recommend these as standalone treatments.
In 2018, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved the use of tofacitinib (Xeljanz) as a treatment for UC. Initially used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, this medication targets cells responsible for inflammation. It�s the first oral medication approved for the long-term treatment of UC.
Hospitalization
If your symptoms are severe, you�ll need to be hospitalized to correct the effects of dehydration and loss of electrolytes that diarrhea causes. You may also need to replace blood and to treat any other complications.
Researchers continue to look for new treatments each year. Learn more about the newest UC treatments.
Ulcerative colitis surgery
Surgery is necessary if you experience:
substantial blood loss
chronic and debilitating symptoms
perforation of your colon
a severe blockage
A CT scan or colonoscopy can detect these serious problems.
Surgery typically involves removing your entire colon and rectum as well as creating a new pathway for waste. This pathway can be out through a small opening in your abdominal wall.
To redirect waste through your abdominal wall, the surgeon will make a small opening in the wall. The tip of your lower small intestine, or the ileum, is then brought to the skin�s surface. Waste will drain through the opening into a bag.
In other types of surgery, the surgeon removes the diseased part of your colon and rectum but retains the outer muscles of your rectum. The surgeon then attaches your small intestine to the rectum to form a small pouch. After this surgery, you�re able to pass stool through your rectum. Bowel movements will be more frequent and watery than normal.
In certain procedures, the anus is also removed. Read more about each of the surgical options and their long-term effects."
colitis,"for colitis, natural remedies for ulcerative colitis?","Some of the medications prescribed to treat UC can have serious side effects. When traditional treatments are not well tolerated, some people turn to natural remedies to manage UC.
Natural remedies that may help relieve UC symptoms include:
Boswellia. This herb is found in the resin underneath Boswellia serrata tree bark. Research suggests it stops some of the chemical reactions in the body that can cause inflammation.
Bromelain. This enzyme mixture is found naturally in pineapples, but it�s also sold as a supplement. It may help ease symptoms of UC and reduce flares.
Probiotics. Your intestines and stomach are home to billions of bacteria. When the bacteria are healthy, your body is better able to ward off inflammation and symptoms of UC. Eating foods with probiotics or taking probiotic supplements can help boost the health of the microbial flora in your gut.
Psyllium. This fiber supplement can help keep bowel movements regular. This may alleviate symptoms, prevent constipation, and make eliminating waste easier. However, many people with IBD can experience worsening abdominal cramping, gas, and bloating when they consume fiber during a flare-up.
Turmeric. This golden yellow spice is chock-full of curcumin, an antioxidant that�s been shown to reduce inflammation.
Keep in mind that these natural remedies have not undergone clinical trials and are not necessarily endorsed by professional organizations or their clinical guidelines.
Many of these natural remedies can be used in conjunction with other UC treatments. Discover which ones might be safe for you and what questions you should ask your doctor."
colitis,"for colitis, ulcerative colitis diet?","There�s no specific diet for UC. Each person reacts to food and drink differently. However, a few general rules may be useful for people trying to avoid a flare-up:
Eat a low fat diet. It�s not clear why a low fat diet is beneficial, but it�s known that foods high in fat commonly cause diarrhea, especially in people with IBD. Eating more low fat foods may delay flare-ups. When you do eat fat, pick healthier options like olive oil and omega-3 fatty acids.
Take in more vitamin C. This vitamin may have a protective effect on your intestines and help them heal or recover faster after a flare-up. People who eat diets rich in vitamin C have prolonged periods of UC remission. Vitamin C-rich foods include parsley, bell peppers, spinach, and berries.
Eat more fiber. During a flare-up, bulky, slow-moving fiber is the last thing you want in your intestines. During remission, however, fiber can help you stay regular. It may also improve how easily you can eliminate waste products during bowel movements.
Making a food diary
Creating a food diary is a smart way to begin to understand which foods affect you. For several weeks, closely track what you eat and how you feel in the hours after. Record details of bowel movements or any symptoms you might experience.
In that span of time, you can likely detect trends between discomfort or stomach pain and certain problematic foods. Try removing those foods from your diet to see if your symptoms improve.
You may be able to manage mild symptoms of UC by avoiding foods that upset your GI tract. Discover the foods that are most likely to cause issues if you have UC."
colitis,"for colitis, frequently asked questions about ulcerative colitis?","Below are some frequently asked questions people have about UC.
What�s the difference between ulcerative colitis and Crohn�s disease?
UC and Crohn�s disease are the most common forms of IBD. Both conditions are thought to be the result of an overactive immune system.
They also share many symptoms, including:
cramps
abdominal pain
diarrhea
fatigue
However, UC and Crohn�s disease do have distinct differences. Understanding the key differences between them can help you obtain a proper diagnosis.
Location
These two conditions affect different portions of the GI tract.
Crohn�s disease may affect any part of the GI tract, from the mouth to the anus. It�s most often found in the small intestine. UC only affects the large intestine (colon) and rectum.
Response to treatment
Similar medications are prescribed to treat both conditions. Surgery is also a treatment option. It�s a last resort for both conditions, but it can be a cure for UC, whereas it�s only a temporary therapy for Crohn�s.
What�s the difference between ulcerative colitis and colitis?
Colitis refers to inflammation of the inner lining of the colon. Colitis causes symptoms such as abdominal pain and cramping, bloating, and diarrhea.
An inflamed colon can be caused by several conditions. UC is one possible cause. Other possible causes of colitis include:
infection
reaction to certain medications
Crohn�s disease
an allergic reaction
To diagnose the cause of colitis, a doctor will order a series of tests. These tests will help them understand what other symptoms you�re experience and rule out conditions based on what you�re not experiencing.
Treatment for colitis will depend on the underlying cause and other symptoms you have.
Is ulcerative colitis curable?
Currently, there�s no nonsurgical cure for UC. Treatments for the inflammatory disease aim to extend periods of remission and make flare-ups less severe.
For people with severe UC, curative surgery is a treatment option. Removing the entire large intestine (as in a total colectomy) will end the symptoms of UC.
This procedure requires your doctor to create a pouch on the outside of your body where waste can empty. This pouch can become inflamed and cause side effects.
For that reason, some people choose to have only a partial colectomy. In this surgery, your doctor only removes the parts of the colon that are affected by UC.
While these surgeries can help ease or end symptoms of UC, they can have adverse effects and possible long-term complications. Read more about these issues to determine if surgery is an option for you.
Is ulcerative colitis contagious?
UC is not contagious.
Some causes of colitis or inflammation in the colon can be contagious, though. That includes inflammation caused by bacteria and viruses.
However, UC is not caused by anything that can be transmitted to another person."
colitis,"for colitis, ulcerative colitis in children?","According to one study of IBD in the United States, 1 in 1,299 children between ages 2 and 17 years old were affected by the condition in 2016. Crohn�s disease was twice as common as UC, and boys were more likely to have IBD than girls.
For children with IBD, a diagnosis is more likely after 10 years old.
UC symptoms in children are similar to symptoms in older individuals. Children may experience bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramping, and fatigue.
In addition, they may experience issues compounded by the condition, such as:
anemia due to blood loss
malnutrition from poor eating
unexplained weight loss
UC can have a significant effect on a child�s life, especially if the condition isn�t treated and managed properly. Treatments for children are more limited because of possible complications. For example, medicated enemas are rarely used as a treatment method in children.
However, children with UC may be prescribed medications that reduce inflammation and prevent immune system attacks on the colon. For some children, surgery may be necessary to manage symptoms.
If your child has been diagnosed with UC, it�s important that you work closely with their doctor to find treatments and lifestyle changes that can help. Check out these tips for parents and children dealing with UC."
colitis,"for colitis, complications of ulcerative colitis?","UC increases your risk of developing colon cancer. The longer you have the disease, the higher your risk of this cancer.
Because of this increased risk, your doctor will perform a colonoscopy and check for cancer when you receive your diagnosis.
Repeat screenings every 1 to 3 years
are recommended thereafter, according to the American Cancer Society. Regular screenings help lower your risk of colon cancer. Follow-up screenings can detect precancerous cells early.
Other complications of UC include:
thickening of the intestinal wall
intestinal bleeding
sepsis, or blood infection
severe dehydration
toxic megacolon, or a rapidly swelling colon
rupture of your colon
inflammation of your skin, joints, and eyes
ankylosing spondylitis, which involves inflammation of joints between your spinal bones
kidney stones
liver disease, which is rare
Complications of UC are worse if the condition isn�t properly treated. Learn more about the complications of unmanaged UC."
colitis,"for colitis, ulcerative colitis risk factors?","Most people with UC don�t have a family history of the condition. However, about 12 percent of people with UC do have a family member with IBD, according to research from 2014.
UC can develop in a person of any race, but it�s more common in white people. If you�re of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, you have a greater chance of developing the condition than most other groups.
Young people with IBD may also be dealing with acne at the same time. Some older studies have suggested a possible link between the use of the cystic acne medication isotretinoin (Absorbica, Amnesteem, Claravis) and UC. However, newer research has yet to find a definitive causal relationship."
colitis,"for colitis, ulcerative colitis prevention?","There�s no solid evidence indicating that your diet affects whether you develop UC. You may find that certain foods and drinks aggravate your symptoms when you have a flare-up, though.
Practices that may help include:
drinking small amounts of water throughout the day
eating smaller meals throughout the day
limiting your intake of high fiber foods
avoiding fatty foods
lowering your intake of milk if you�re lactose intolerant
Also, ask a doctor if you should take a multivitamin."
colitis,"for colitis, outlook for people with ulcerative colitis?","If you have UC, a doctor will need to monitor your condition, and you�ll need to carefully follow your treatment plan throughout your life.
The only true cure for UC is removal of the entire colon and rectum. Your doctor will usually begin with medical therapy unless you have a severe complication that requires surgery. Some people will eventually require surgery, but most do well with nonsurgical therapy and care.

Could you describe what diverticulosis is? I�d like to know more about diverticulosis. Can you help? What information do you have on diverticulosis? Could you provide information on diverticulosis?,Diverticulitis can cause digestive symptoms and abdominal pain. Some people may develop complications that require urgent medical care.
diverticulosis,"for diverticulosis, what is diverticulitis??","Although it was rare before the 20th century, diverticular disease is a very common health problem in the Western world. It�s a group of conditions that can affect your digestive tract.
The most serious type of diverticular disease is diverticulitis. It can cause uncomfortable symptoms and, in some cases, serious complications. If left untreated, these complications can cause long-term health problems.
Read on to learn more about diverticulitis, including its causes, symptoms, treatment options, and how your diet might affect your risk of developing it."
diverticulosis,"for diverticulosis, symptoms of diverticulitis?","Diverticulitis can cause symptoms ranging from mild to severe. These symptoms can appear suddenly, or they can develop gradually over several days.
Potential symptoms of diverticular disease include
:
pain in your abdomen
bloating
diarrhea
constipation
If you develop diverticulitis, you might experience:
constant or severe pain in your abdomen
nausea and vomiting
fever and chills
blood in your stool
bleeding from your rectum
Abdominal pain is the most common
symptom of diverticulitis. It will most likely occur in the lower left side of your abdomen. It can also develop in the right side of your abdomen.
If you develop any of the above symptoms, it may be a sign of a serious complication from diverticulitis or another condition. Call your doctor right away."
diverticulosis,"for diverticulosis, causes of diverticulitis?","Diverticular disease develops when pouches form along your digestive tract, typically in your colon (large intestine). These pouches (diverticula) can become inflamed and infected, which may occur when feces or partially digested food blocks the opening of the diverticula.
Although there�s no single known cause of diverticular disease, several factors can increase the risk of developing diverticulitis, including
:
genetics
diet
decreased immune function
having obesity
physical inactivity
smoking
changes in the gut microbiome
certain medications, such as steroids"
diverticulosis,"for diverticulosis, what are the complications of diverticulitis??","More than 75 percent
of diverticulitis cases are uncomplicated, leaving about 25 percent to develop complications.
These complications can include:
abscess, an infected pocket that�s filled with pus
phlegmon, an infected area that�s less well-confined than an abscess
fistula, an abnormal connection that can develop between two organs or between an organ and the skin
intestinal perforation, a tear or hole in the intestinal wall that can allow the contents of your colon to leak into your abdominal cavity, causing inflammation and infection
intestinal obstruction, a blockage in your intestine that can stop stool from passing"
diverticulosis,"for diverticulosis, diagnosis of diverticulitis?","To diagnose diverticulitis, your doctor will likely ask about your symptoms, health history, and any medications you take. They�ll likely perform a physical exam to check your abdomen for tenderness.
If they need more information, they may perform a digital rectal exam to check for:
rectal bleeding
pain
masses
other problems
Several other conditions can cause symptoms that are similar to diverticulitis. To rule out other conditions and check for signs of diverticulitis, your doctor might order one or more tests.
Tests can include:
abdominal ultrasound, abdominal MRI scan, abdominal CT scan, or abdominal X-ray to create pictures of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract
colonoscopy to examine the inside of your GI tract; although this takes place after a bout of diverticulosis
stool test to check for infections, such as Clostridium difficile (C. diff)
urine test to check for infections
blood tests to check for signs of inflammation, anemia, or kidney or liver problems
pelvic exam to rule out gynecological problems in people assigned female at birth
pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy in people assigned female at birth
If you have diverticulitis, these exams and tests can help your doctor learn if it�s uncomplicated or complicated.
Using a colonoscopy to diagnose diverticulitis
If you have symptoms of diverticulitis, your doctor might
encourage you to have a colonoscopy once the acute episode resolves. This procedure can help confirm a diagnosis of diverticulitis or another condition that causes similar symptoms, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn�s disease.
During a colonoscopy, your doctor will thread a flexible scope into your rectum and colon. They can use this scope to examine the inside of your colon. They can also use it to collect tissue samples for testing.
To help you feel more comfortable during this procedure, you will be sedated beforehand.
In some cases, your doctor might learn that you have diverticula during a routine colonoscopy. If the diverticula aren�t inflamed, infected, or causing symptoms, you probably won�t need treatment."
diverticulosis,"for diverticulosis, treatment for diverticulitis?","The treatment that your doctor prescribes for diverticulitis will depend on how severe your condition is.
Uncomplicated diverticulitis can typically be treated at home. Your doctor might
encourage you to make changes to your diet. In some cases, they might prescribe medications, including antibiotics.
If you develop complications from diverticulitis, you may need
to visit a hospital for treatment. You may be given fluids and antibiotics through an intravenous (IV) line. Depending on the type of complication, you might need to undergo surgery or another procedure."
diverticulosis,"for diverticulosis, diet and diverticulitis?","There are no particular foods
that everyone with diverticulitis has to avoid. However, you might find that certain foods make your condition better or worse.
As your symptoms improve, your doctor might encourage you to eat more high fiber foods. Some studies
have linked high fiber diets to reduced risk of diverticulitis. Other studies
have examined possible benefits of dietary or supplemental fiber for diverticular disease but are still unsure of the role fiber should play.
Your doctor might also encourage you to limit your consumption of red meat, high-fat dairy products, and refined grain products. A large cohort study
found that people who follow a diet that�s rich in these foods are more likely to develop diverticulitis than people who eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
Diet can play a role in managing diverticulitis and your overall digestive health. Take a moment to learn about some of the foods that might affect your symptoms.
Dietary changes
To give your digestive system a chance to rest and recover, your doctor might suggest
avoiding solid foods and following a clear-liquid diet for a few days.
If your symptoms are mild or have started to improve, you may be able to try eating low-fiber foods until your condition gets better. As your condition improves, your doctor will likely encourage you to add more high-fiber foods to your snacks and meals.
Medication
To reduce pain or discomfort from diverticulitis, your doctor might recommend over-the-counter pain medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol).
If they suspect you have an infection, they�ll likely prescribe
antibiotics to treat it. These can include:
metronidazole (Flagyl, Flagyl ER)
amoxicillin
moxifloxacin
It�s important to take your full course of prescribed antibiotics, even if your symptoms improve after the first few doses.
Other procedures
If you develop a complicated case of diverticulitis that can�t be treated through diet and medication alone, your doctor might recommend
one of the following procedures:
Needle drainage. In this procedure, a needle is inserted into your abdomen to drain an abscess of pus.
Surgery. Surgeries may involve draining an abscess of pus, repairing a fistula, or removing infected segments of the colon."
diverticulosis,"for diverticulosis, surgery for diverticulitis?","If you experience multiple episodes of diverticulitis that can�t be effectively managed with dietary changes and medications, your doctor might recommend
surgery. Surgery may also be used to treat complications from diverticulitis.
There are two main types
of surgery used to treat diverticulitis.
Bowel resection with anastomosis
During a bowel resection with anastomosis, a surgeon removes infected segments of your colon and reattaches the healthy segments to each other.
Bowel resection with colostomy
In a bowel resection with colostomy, the surgeon removes infected sections of your colon and attaches the end of the healthy section to an opening in your abdomen, known as a stoma.
Both procedures can be performed as open surgery or laparoscopic surgery. Learn more about the types of surgery that can be used to treat diverticulitis."
diverticulosis,"for diverticulosis, home remedies for diverticulitis?","Home remedies for diverticulitis mostly consist of making dietary changes, but there are a few other options that may be helpful for symptoms and digestive health.
Some home remedies for diverticulitis include:
Probiotics. Although more research is needed, some studies
have found that certain strains of probiotics might help relieve or prevent symptoms of diverticulitis.
Aromatherapy. Certain essential oils have been shown
to reduce pain, which could be beneficial for managing your symptoms.
Acupuncture. Not only can acupuncture improve
digestive issues like constipation, but some research
also suggests that it could help treat chronic pain.
Herbs. Several herbs possess
powerful anti-inflammatory properties, including ginger, turmeric, and rosemary. However, more research is needed to evaluate the effects of these herbs on diverticulitis specifically.
Read more about the home remedies that might help you manage this condition."
diverticulosis,"for diverticulosis, meckel�s diverticulitis?","Diverticular disease usually affects
adults. In rare cases, babies are born with diverticula. When this happens, it�s known as Meckel�s diverticulum. If the diverticula become inflamed, it�s called Meckel�s diverticulitis.
In some cases, Meckel�s diverticulum doesn�t cause noticeable effects. In other cases, it can cause symptoms such as
:
abdominal pain
nausea
vomiting
bloody stool
bleeding from the rectum
If you suspect your child might have diverticulitis, make an appointment with their doctor. Learn about some of the strategies pediatricians can use to diagnose and manage Meckel�s diverticulum.

diverticulosis,"for diverticulosis, preventing diverticulitis?","More research is needed to learn what causes diverticular disease, including diverticulitis. Currently, experts believe multiple factors play a part. Some potential risk factors may be modified through lifestyle changes.
For example, it might help
to:
try to maintain a moderate body weight
eat a diet that�s high in fiber to help bulk up stools (however, in acute diverticulitis, you may want to avoid fiber)
limit your consumption of saturated fat
get enough vitamin D
get regular exercise if possible
try to avoid cigarette smoke
These prevention strategies can also help promote good overall health."
diverticulosis,"for diverticulosis, risk factors for diverticulitis?","One of the main risk factors for diverticulitis is age. Older people are more likely than younger people to develop diverticulitis. It commonly occurs
in men under 50 and women ages 50 to 70.
People who develop diverticula at a younger age
may be more likely to experience diverticulitis. Younger people are also more likely
to be admitted to a hospital if they have diverticulitis than older people.
According to a review of research
published in 2018, other potential risk factors for diverticulitis include:
Family history
Studies have found that genetics play a role in diverticular disease, with some reports estimating that roughly 40 to 50 percent
of the potential risk of diverticular disease is hereditary.
Low levels of vitamin D
Some studies
suggest that people with higher levels of vitamin D might have a lower risk of getting diverticulitis. More research is needed to understand the potential link between vitamin D and diverticula.
Obesity
Several studies
have found that people with higher body mass index (BMI) and larger waists are at increased risk of diverticulitis.
It�s possible that obesity raises the risk of diverticulitis by changing the balance of bacteria in your gut, but more research is needed to understand the role this plays.
Physical inactivity
Some studies
have found that physically active people are less likely than inactive people to develop diverticulitis. However, this link still needs more research.
Using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or smoking
Regular use of aspirin, ibuprofen, or other NSAIDs may raise your risk of diverticulitis.
People who smoke are also more likely than nonsmokers to develop diverticular disease, including diverticulitis.
According to a 2017 review of research
, there�s no strong evidence that drinking alcohol raises your risk of this disease.
If you drink alcohol, your doctor will likely encourage you to drink in moderation only. Although alcohol consumption might not cause diverticulitis, drinking too much can raise your risk of many other health problems."
diverticulosis,"for diverticulosis, diverticulitis vs. diverticulosis?","If you have diverticula that aren�t infected or inflamed, it�s known as diverticulosis.
In some cases, diverticulosis can cause symptoms such as pain in the abdomen and bloating. When that happens, it�s known as symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD)."
diverticulosis,"for diverticulosis, other forms of diverticulitis?","Diverticula can also develop in your bladder. This happens when the lining of your bladder forms pouches, poking through weak spots in your bladder�s wall.
Sometimes bladder diverticula are present at birth. In other cases, they develop later in life. They can form when your bladder outlet is blocked, or your bladder isn�t working properly due to illness or injury.
If you have bladder diverticula that becomes inflamed, it�s known as bladder diverticulitis. To treat bladder diverticulitis, your doctor might prescribe antibiotics and pain medications. They might also recommend surgery to repair the diverticula.
It�s also possible for diverticulitis in your colon to affect your bladder. In severe cases, you might develop a fistula between your colon and bladder. This is known as a colovesical fistula. Find out what this condition involves.
Diverticula can potentially form in your esophagus, too. This occurs when
pouches develop in your esophageal lining.
Esophageal diverticula are rare. When they do develop, it�s usually slowly and over many years. As they grow, they can cause symptoms or complications such as:
trouble swallowing
pain when swallowing
halitosis, or bad breath
regurgitation of food and saliva
pulmonary aspiration: breathing regurgitated food or saliva into your lungs
aspiration pneumonia: developing a lung infection after breathing in food or saliva
If the diverticula become inflamed, it�s known as esophageal diverticulitis.
To treat esophageal diverticulitis, your doctor might prescribe antibiotics and pain medications. To repair the diverticula, they might recommend surgery. Get more information about your treatment options."
diverticulosis,"for diverticulosis, takeaway?","Diverticulitis is relatively common
in the Western world. In most cases, it can be treated through short-term dietary changes and medication.

a difficult struggle or challenge
depression
Seeking help early can help you reduce your risk for suicidal ideation and suicide.
Your risk of suicide might increase if you have:

suicide attempt,"for suicide attempt, passive suicidal ideation?","Passive suicidal ideation is when a person desires death but has no specific plan to commit suicide.
If you�re experiencing passive suicidal ideation, your fantasies may involve dying in your sleep or having a fatal accident. You may believe that the world would be better off without you.
Passive doesn�t mean harmless. This train of thought has the potential to make you more likely to put yourself in harm�s way.
Even if passive suicidal ideation appears to be fleeting, the risk of a suicide attempt is very real. The line between passive and active suicidal ideation is blurry. The transition from one to the other can happen slowly or suddenly, and it�s not always obvious to the casual observer.
While someone might admit to wishing to die, they may deny making plans to do so. Warning signs that suicidal ideation has become active include giving away possessions, getting affairs in order, and saying goodbye to loved ones.
No one could ever predict with 100 percent certainty if someone will or will not take their own life. Even trained medical professionals can�t predict who will commit suicide. This is why you need to take threats or thoughts of suicide seriously.
An underlying condition such as substance abuse, major depression, or other mood disorders may lead to a preoccupation with dying. Added stressors such as the death of a loved one, divorce, or a job loss can trigger thoughts of hopelessness or worthlessness.
You shouldn�t take passive suicidal ideation lightly. It�s impossible to predict who�s likely to act on these thoughts. That�s why anyone who expresses passive suicidal ideation should be considered at risk for suicide.
See your doctor or psychiatrist for a careful evaluation and to get appropriate treatment."
suicide attempt,"for suicide attempt, medications and suicidal ideation?","Researchers have linked some medications with an increase in suicidal thoughts.

lymphoma,what is lymphoma? Tell me about lymphoma? What kind of disease is lymphoma? Can you elaborate on lymphoma? What can you tell me about lymphoma? Could you describe what lymphoma is? I�d like to know more about lymphoma. Can you help? What information do you have on lymphoma? Could you provide information on lymphoma?,Lymphoma refers to cancer that starts in the lymphatic system and affects white blood cells called lymphocytes.
lymphoma,"for lymphoma, what is lymphoma??","The lymph system is a series of lymph nodes and vessels that move lymph fluid through the body. Lymph fluids contain infection-fighting white blood cells. Lymph nodes act as filters, capturing and destroying bacteria and viruses to prevent infection from spreading.
While the lymph system typically protects your body, lymph cells called lymphocytes can become cancerous.
Lymphoma definition
Lymphoma is a general term for cancer that starts in the lymph system. There are two categories of lymphoma: Hodgkin�s lymphoma and non-Hodgkin�s lymphoma.
Under these two categories, researchers have classified more than 70 types of lymphoma. Lymphomas can affect any portion of the lymphatic system, including:
bone marrow
thymus
spleen
tonsils
lymph nodes"
lymphoma,"for lymphoma, what are the symptoms of lymphoma??","Lymphoma may not always cause symptoms in its early stages. Instead, a doctor may discover enlarged lymph nodes during a physical examination. These may feel like small, soft nodules under the skin. A person may feel the lymph nodes in the:
neck
upper chest
armpit
stomach
groin
Likewise, many of the symptoms of early lymphoma are not specific. That makes them easy to overlook. These common early symptoms of lymphoma include:
chills
cough
fatigue
enlarged spleen
fever
night sweats
itchy rash
shortness of breath
skin itching
stomach pain
loss of appetite
unexplained weight loss
Because the symptoms of lymphoma are often easily overlooked, it can be difficult to detect and then diagnose it in an early stage. It�s important to know how the symptoms may begin to change as the cancer worsens."
lymphoma,"for lymphoma, what are the types of lymphoma??","The two major lymphoma types are Hodgkin�s lymphoma and non-Hodgkin�s lymphoma, or NHL. A pathologist in the 1800s named Dr. Thomas Hodgkin identified the cells in what is now called Hodgkin�s lymphoma.
Those with Hodgkin�s lymphoma have large cancerous cells called Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells. People with NHL don�t have these cells."
lymphoma,"for lymphoma, non-hodgkin�s lymphoma?","According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), NHL is more common than Hodgkin�s lymphoma
, accounting for 4 percent of all cancers.
Many lymphoma types fall under each category. Doctors call NHL types by the cells they affect, and if the cells are fast- or slow-growing. NHL forms in either the B cells or T cells of the immune system.
According to the ACS, most NHL types affect B cells
. Types include:
B-cell lymphoma
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most aggressive type of NHL. This fast-growing lymphoma comes from abnormal B cells in the blood. It can be cured if treated, but if left untreated, it can lead to death. The stage of DLBCL helps determine your prognosis.
T-cell lymphoma
T-cell lymphoma is not as common as B-cell lymphoma; only 15 percent
of all NHL cases are this type. Several types of T-cell lymphoma exist.
Burkitt�s lymphoma
Burkitt�s lymphoma is a rare type of NHL that is aggressive and most common in people with compromised immune systems. This type of lymphoma is most common in children in sub-Saharan Africa, but it does occur in other parts of the world.
Follicular lymphoma
About 1 in 5
lymphomas diagnosed in the United States are follicular lymphoma. This type of NHL, which starts in the white blood cells, is most common in older individuals. The average age of diagnosis is 60. This lymphoma is also slow-growing, so treatments begin with watchful waiting.
Mantle cell lymphoma
This aggressive form of lymphoma is rare � only about 6 percent of NHL cases are this type. Mantle cell lymphoma is also more commonly diagnosed at a later stage, and it usually occurs in or involves the gastrointestinal tract or bone marrow.
Primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma
This subtype of B-cell lymphoma accounts for almost 10 percent of DLBCL cases. It predominantly affects women in their 20s and 30s.
Small lymphocytic lymphoma
Small lymphatic lymphoma (SLL) is a type of slow-growing lymphoma. The cancer cells of SLL are found mostly in the lymph nodes. SLL is identical to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but with CLL, the majority of cancer cells are found in the blood and bone marrow.
Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma)
Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) is a rare type of cancer that accounts for just about 2 percent
of all lymphomas. It mostly affects older adults. Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is a subtype of LPL. It causes the abnormal production of antibodies."
lymphoma,"for lymphoma, hodgkin�s lymphoma?","Hodgkin�s lymphomas typically start in RS cells. While the main cause of Hodgkin�s lymphoma isn�t known, certain risk factors can increase your risk of developing this type of cancer. Hodgkin�s lymphoma types include:
Lymphocyte-depleted Hodgkin�s disease
This rare, aggressive type of lymphoma occurs in about 1 percent
of lymphoma cases, and it�s most commonly diagnosed in individuals in their 30s. In diagnostic tests, doctors will see normal lymphocytes with an abundance of RS cells.
Patients with a compromised immune system, such as those with HIV, are more likely to be diagnosed with this type of lymphoma.
Lymphocyte-rich Hodgkin�s disease
This type of lymphoma is more common in men, and it accounts for about 5 percent of Hodgkin�s lymphoma cases. Lymphocyte-rich Hodgkin�s disease is typically diagnosed at an early stage, and both lymphocytes and RS cells are present in diagnostic tests.
Mixed cellularity Hodgkin�s lymphoma
Like with lymphocyte-rich Hodgkin�s disease, mixed cellularity Hodgkin�s lymphoma contains both lymphocytes and RS cells. It�s more common � almost a quarter of Hodgkin�s lymphoma cases are this type � and it�s more prevalent in older adult men.
Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin�s disease
Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin�s disease (NLPHL) type of Hodgkin�s lymphoma occurs in about 5 percent of people with lymphoma, and it�s characterized by an absence of RS cells.
NLPHL is most common in people between the ages of 30 and 50, and it�s more common in males. Rarely, NLPHL can progress or transform into a type of aggressive NHL.
Nodular sclerosis Hodgkin�s lymphoma
This common type of lymphoma occurs in 70 percent of Hodgkin�s cases, and it�s more common in young adults than in any other group. This type of lymphoma occurs in lymph nodes that contain scar tissue, or sclerosis.
Fortunately, this type of lymphoma is highly treatable with a high cure rate."
lymphoma,"for lymphoma, what are the causes of lymphoma??","Lymphoma occurs when white blood cells called lymphocytes grow out of control. The average life span of a lymphocytes cell is brief, and then the cell dies. In people with lymphoma, however, DNA changes inside the lymphocytes cells cause them to thrive and spread instead of dying.
It�s unclear what exactly causes this DNA change, and even though there are some risk factors connected with lymphoma, people without the risk factors can still develop these cancers."
lymphoma,"for lymphoma, what are risk factors for lymphoma??","Most diagnosed lymphoma cases have no known cause. However, some people are considered to be at higher risk.
Non-Hodgkin�s lymphoma risk factors
Risk factors for NHL include:
Immunodeficiency. This could be due to a weak immune system from HIV or taking an immune system-suppressing drug after an organ transplant.
Autoimmune disease. People with certain autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and celiac disease, have an increased risk of lymphoma.
Age. Lymphoma is most common in older individuals. However, some types are more common in children and infants.
Sex. The overall risk of NHL is higher in men than women, but there are some types of NHL that are more likely to develop in women.
Ethnicity. White people in the United States are more likely to develop some types of lymphoma than African Americans or Asian Americans.
Infection. People who have had infections such as the human T-cell leukemia/lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1), Heliobacter pylori, hepatitis C, or the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are associated with an increased risk.
Chemical and radiation exposure. Those exposed to chemicals in pesticides, fertilizers, and herbicides are also at increased risk. Nuclear radiation can also increase risks for developing NHL.
Body size. Individuals living with obesity may be at a higher risk of developing lymphoma, but more research is needed to understand this possible risk factor.
Hodgkin�s lymphoma risk factors
Risk factors for Hodgkin�s lymphoma include:
Age. More cases are diagnosed in people between the ages of 20 and 30 and in people over 55.
Sex. Men are more likely than women to develop this type of lymphoma.
Family history. If a sibling is diagnosed with this type of cancer, your risk of also developing it is higher.
Infectious mononucleosis. An EBV infection can cause mononucleosis. This infection can increase the risk of lymphoma.
Immunodeficiency. Individuals with HIV have a greater risk of developing lymphoma."
lymphoma,"for lymphoma, how is lymphoma diagnosed??","Typically, a doctor will do a biopsy if they suspect lymphoma. This involves removing cells from an enlarged lymph node. A specialist known as a hematopathologist will examine the cells to determine if lymphoma cells are present and what cell type they are.
If the hematopathologist detects lymphoma cells, further testing can identify how far the cancer has spread. These tests can include
a chest X-ray
blood testing to check on white and red blood cell count
testing nearby lymph nodes or tissues
a bone marrow aspiration, where a small amount of liquid is taken from bone marrow and tested
a lumbar puncture (spinal tap), where a small amount of fluid from the spine is removed and tested
an abdominal ultrasound
Imaging scans, such as CT or MRI scans may also identify additional tumors or enlarged lymph nodes."
lymphoma,"for lymphoma, treating lymphoma?","Typically, a number of medical specialists will collaborate to treat lymphoma:
Hematologists are doctors who specialize in blood, bone marrow, and immune cell disorders.
Oncologists treat cancerous tumors.
Pathologists may work with these doctors to assist in treatment planning and identify if a particular treatment is working.
Treatment plans depend on a few conditions, including the individual�s age and overall health, the type of lymphoma an individual has, and the cancer�s stage.
Doctors will stage a tumor to signify how far the cancerous cells may have spread. A stage 1 tumor is limited to a few lymph nodes, while a stage 4 tumor has spread to other organs, such as the lungs or bone marrow.
Doctors also grade NHL tumors by how fast they�re growing. These terms include:
low grade or indolent
intermediate grade or aggressive
high grade or highly aggressive
Treating Hodgkin�s lymphoma
Treatment for Hodgkin�s lymphoma usually includes radiation therapy to shrink and kill cancerous cells. Doctors may also prescribe chemotherapy medications to destroy cancerous cells.
Newer treatments also include immunotherapy therapy drugs like nivolumab (Opdivo) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda), which help the body�s T cells attack the cancer.
Treating Non-Hodgkin�s lymphoma
Chemotherapy and radiation are also used to treat NHL. Biological therapies that target cancerous B cells also can be effective. An example of this drug type includes nivolumab (Opdivo).
For some individuals, such as those with large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), CAR T cell therapy is part of the treatment. CAR T cell therapy uses the body�s own cells to treat the cancer: Immune cells are taken from the body, given with new proteins in a lab, and then infused back into the body.
In some instances of both Hodgkin�s lymphoma and NHL, a bone marrow or stem cell transplant may be used to build up healthy immune system cells. Doctors may harvest these cells or tissues before beginning chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Relatives may be able to donate bone marrow too."
lymphoma,"for lymphoma, stages of lymphoma?","Both NHL and Hodgkin�s lymphoma can be classified into four stages. The state of lymphoma is determined by where the cancer is and how far it has or has not spread.
Stage 1. Cancer is in one lymph node or one organ site.
Stage 2. Cancer is in two lymph nodes near to one another and on the same side of the body, or the cancer is in one organ and nearby lymph nodes.
Stage 3. At this point, cancer is in lymph nodes on both sides of the diaphragm.
Stage 4. The cancer can be in an organ and spread beyond nearby lymph nodes. As NHL progresses, it may begin to spread. The most common sites for advanced NHL include the liver, bone marrow, and lungs.
While stage 4 lymphoma is advanced, it�s still treatable."
lymphoma,"for lymphoma, lymphoma prognosis?","An individual�s prognosis after a lymphoma diagnosis depends on the stage and type of lymphoma. Many types of lymphoma are treatable and highly curable.
Some types of lymphoma are also slow-growing, or indolent. In this case, doctors may choose not to treat because the prognosis, even with the lymphoma, is still good in the long term.
According to the ACS
, the 5-year survival rate for stage 1 Hodgkin�s lymphoma is 91 percent; for stage 4, it�s 81 percent.
For NHL, the ACS
states the 5-year survival rate is 73 percent; the 10-year survival rate is 57 percent."
lymphoma,"for lymphoma, lymphoma in children?","Many of the same risk factors for lymphoma in children are risk factors for adults, but certain types of lymphoma are more common in children.
For example, Hodgkin�s lymphoma is more common in children ages 15 and younger,
but the type of NHL that occurs in children is typically aggressive and fast-growing.
Children who have immune system deficiencies, such as HIV, or those who take immune-suppressing drugs are at an increased risk for lymphoma. Likewise, children who�ve undergone radiation therapy or chemotherapy have a higher risk of developing this type of cancer."
lymphoma,"for lymphoma, lymphoma vs. leukemia?","Both leukemia and lymphoma are types of blood cancer, and they share some common symptoms. However, their origins, treatments, and specific symptoms set the two types of cancer apart.
Symptoms
People with both lymphoma and leukemia experience fever and night sweats. However, leukemia is more likely to cause excessive bleeding, easy bruising, headaches, and increased infections. People with lymphoma are more likely to experience itchy skin, loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss, and swollen lymph nodes.
Origins
Leukemia typically begins in the bone marrow. It causes the marrow to produce too many white blood cells. Lymphoma begins in the lymph nodes, and it progresses as the abnormal white blood cells spread.
Treatment
Doctors may choose to practice watchful waiting for both lymphoma and leukemia. That�s because some types of these cancers are slow-growing and not aggressive.
If your doctor decides to treat either cancer, chemotherapy and radiation are used to treat both, but leukemia has two other common treatments. These are stem cell transplants and targeted drug therapy."
lymphoma,"for lymphoma, outlook?","Lymphoma is a term for cancer that starts in the lymph system.
There are two overarching categories of lymphoma: Hodgkin�s lymphoma and non-Hodgkin�s lymphoma, or NHL. Within these categories, there are more than 70 different types. Depending on the stage the cancer is discovered, the age and health of the individual, and a few other factors, many types of lymphoma are treatable and curable.
According to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Hodgkin�s lymphoma is highly curable � depending on some outside factors.
According to the ACS
, NHL is also treatable, with the overall 5-year survival rate for NHL patients coming in at 70 percent. The 10-year survival rate at 60 percent
.
Individuals diagnosed with lymphoma often have a team of doctors behind them and a treatment plan designed for their journey."
encephalopathy,what is encephalopathy? Tell me about encephalopathy? What kind of disease is encephalopathy? Can you elaborate on encephalopathy? What can you tell me about encephalopathy? Could you describe what encephalopathy is? I�d like to know more about encephalopathy. Can you help? What information do you have on encephalopathy? Could you provide information on encephalopathy?,"What is encephalopathy?
Encephalopathy is a general term describing a disease that affects the function or structure of your brain. There are many types of encephalopathy and brain disease. Some types are permanent and some are temporary. Some types are present from birth and never change, while others are acquired after birth and may get progressively worse."
encephalopathy,"for encephalopathy, what are the types and causes of encephalopathy??","The following are some major types of encephalopathy, along with their causes.
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy
This type of encephalopathy occurs when there are multiple traumas or injuries to the brain. These blows to the head lead to nerve damage in the brain. It�s usually found in boxers, football players, or members of the military who have been injured in explosions.
Glycine encephalopathy
Glycine encephalopathy is a genetic, or inherited, condition in which there are abnormally high levels of glycine (an amino acid) in the brain. Symptoms of glycine encephalopathy usually appear in infants soon after birth.
Hashimoto�s encephalopathy
This is a rare type of encephalopathy that�s linked to an autoimmune condition known as Hashimoto�s thyroiditis. In Hashimoto�s thyroiditis, your immune system mistakenly attacks your thyroid gland. Your thyroid gland is responsible for producing many of your body�s regulating hormones. Scientists don�t yet know exactly how the two conditions are linked.
Hepatic encephalopathy
Hepatic encephalopathy is a result of liver disease. When your liver isn�t functioning properly, the toxins that your liver usually removes from your body are instead allowed to build up in your blood, and can eventually reach your brain.
Hypertensive encephalopathy
Hypertensive encephalopathy is a result of severely high blood pressure that goes untreated for too long. This can cause your brain to swell, leading to brain damage and hypertensive encephalopathy.
Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy
This condition is a type of brain damage that is caused when the brain doesn�t get enough oxygen. This can result in permanent brain damage or dysfunction. It can be caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain, such as when a developing baby is exposed to alcohol in the womb.
Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy
Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy is a result of infections, toxins, or organ failure. When the electrolytes, hormones, or other chemicals in the body are off their normal balance, they can impact the brain�s function. This can also include the presence of an infection in the body or presence of toxic chemicals. The encephalopathy usually resolves when the underlying chemical imbalance is restored or offending infection/toxin removed.
Infectious encephalopathies
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are also known as prion diseases. Prions are proteins that occur naturally in the body, but they can mutate and cause diseases that gradually damage and deteriorate your brain (neurodegenerative diseases). Prion diseases include:
chronic wasting disease
fatal familial insomnia
kuru
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
Uremic encephalopathy
Uremic encephalopathy is a result of kidney failure. It is believed to be caused by the buildup of uremic toxins in the blood. This condition can cause mild confusion to deep coma.
Wernicke encephalopathy
Also known as Wernicke�s disease, this condition is a result of vitamin B-1 deficiency. Long-term alcoholism, poor nutritional intake, and poor food absorption can cause a vitamin B-1 deficiency. If Wernicke encephalopathy isn�t treated quickly, it can lead to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome."
encephalopathy,"for encephalopathy, what are the symptoms of encephalopathy??","Your symptoms will depend on the cause and severity of your encephalopathy.
Mental changes
You may have difficulty with memory or focusing. You may also have trouble with problem-solving skills.
Other people may notice symptoms in you before you do. A changing personality is one such symptom. For example, you may be more outgoing than you were before the encephalopathy. You may be more or less calm than you were before the disease.
You could also be lethargic and drowsy.
Neurological symptoms
Possible neurological symptoms include:
muscle weakness in one area
poor decision-making or concentration
involuntary twitching
trembling
difficulty speaking or swallowing
seizures"
encephalopathy,"for encephalopathy, when should i seek medical help??","You should see a doctor right away if you experience symptoms of encephalopathy. If you are already receiving treatment for brain disease, be aware of the following signs:
severe confusion
severe disorientation
coma
These can be signs of a medical urgency. They may mean that your condition is getting worse."
encephalopathy,"for encephalopathy, how is encephalopathy diagnosed??","To diagnose encephalopathy, your doctor will ask you questions about your medical history and your symptoms. They will also perform a medical exam to check for mental and neurological symptoms.
If your doctor suspects that you have brain disease, they may conduct tests to determine the causes and severity of your disease. Tests may include:
blood tests to detect diseases, bacteria, viruses, toxins, hormonal or chemical imbalance, or prions
spinal tap (your doctor will take a sample of your spinal fluid to look for diseases, bacteria, viruses, toxins, or prion)
CT or MRI scan of your brain to detect abnormalities or damage
electroencephalogram (EEG) test to measure the electrical activity in your brain"
encephalopathy,"for encephalopathy, how is encephalopathy treated??","The treatment for encephalopathy varies depending on what caused it. Treatment may include medications to treat your symptoms and medications or surgery to treat the underlying cause.
Your doctor may recommend nutritional supplements to slow the damage to your brain, or a special diet to treat underlying causes. In some cases of the disease, such as when the brain does not receive enough oxygen, you may slip into a coma. In severe cases like this, your doctor may put you on life support to keep you alive."
encephalopathy,"for encephalopathy, is encephalopathy preventable??","Some types of encephalopathy � such as hereditary types � are not preventable. However, other types are preventable.
Making the following changes can reduce your risk of developing many of the underlying causes of encephalopathy:
avoiding excess alcohol
reducing exposure to toxic substances like drugs
eating a healthy diet
seeing your doctor regularly
Living a healthy lifestyle can help reduce your risk factors for brain disease."
encephalopathy,"for encephalopathy, long-term outlook?","Your long-term outlook depends on the cause and severity of your encephalopathy. Many forms of encephalopathy are reversible if the cause can be identified and treated. All types can be fatal if severe enough. Some types are always fatal.
According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy usually results in death within three months to a few years from the onset of the disease.
Treatment for the cause of your brain disease may improve your symptoms or may get rid of the encephalopathy. Depending on the type of encephalopathy, you may or may not have permanent damage to your brain. Your healthcare team can work with you and your loved ones regarding ongoing treatment and plans for therapy to support your day-to-day life in the case of brain damage."

Can you elaborate on tricuspid valve insufficiency? What can you tell me about tricuspid valve insufficiency? Could you describe what tricuspid valve insufficiency is? I�d like to know more about tricuspid valve insufficiency. Can you help? What information do you have on tricuspid valve insufficiency? Could you provide information on tricuspid valve insufficiency?,"What is tricuspid regurgitation?
In order to understand tricuspid regurgitation, it helps to understand the basic anatomy of your heart.
Your heart is divided into four sections called chambers. The upper chambers are the left atrium and right atrium, and the lower chambers are the left ventricle and right ventricle. The left and right sides of the heart are separated by a wall of muscle called the septum.
The upper (atria) and lower (ventricles) chambers are connected. Openings called valves regulate blood flow in and out of the heart and between the chambers. The valves can be thought of like water faucets. They either open up and allow blood to flow freely, or close and stop the flow entirely.
Your tricuspid valve is the valve that separates your right atrium and right ventricle. Tricuspid regurgitation occurs when this valve doesn�t properly close. This can cause blood to flow back up into the right atrium when the right ventricle contracts. Over time, this condition can weaken your heart.
Tricuspid regurgitation is also known as tricuspid valve insufficiency."
tricuspid valve insufficiency,"for tricuspid valve insufficiency, recognizing the signs and symptoms of tricuspid regurgitation?","Tricuspid regurgitation may not cause any recognizable symptoms at first. You�re more likely to experience symptoms if you also have pulmonary hypertension or high blood pressure.
Symptoms of tricuspid regurgitation include:
abdominal swelling
decreased urine output
foot and ankle swelling
general weakness
an irregular heart rhythm
swelling in the body
pulsing in your neck vein
unexplained fatigue"
tricuspid valve insufficiency,"for tricuspid valve insufficiency, what causes tricuspid regurgitation??","There are three main causes of tricuspid regurgitation:
Right ventricle dilation
The most common cause of tricuspid regurgitation is right ventricle dilation. The right ventricle is responsible for pumping blood from your heart to your lungs. When the right ventricle is forced to work extra hard at this task, it can dilate (or become larger) to compensate. This can cause the ring of tissue that support�s the tricuspid valve�s ability to open and close to dilate as well.
The enlargement can be a complication of many different disorders, including:
emphysema
pulmonary hypertension
left-side heart disorders
pulmonic stenosis
Infection
Infections can directly injure the tricuspid valve, eventually leading to tricuspid regurgitation. The most common of these infections is infective endocarditis.
Diet medications
The diet medications phentermine and fenfluramine � also known as �Fen-Phen� � have been linked to tricuspid regurgitation. These drugs, however, are now off the market and are no longer a common cause of tricuspid regurgitation.
Other causes
There are other possible causes of tricuspid regurgitation, although they are all fairly rare. They include:
certain injuries
carcinoid tumors
systemic lupus
birth defects of the valve
Ebstein�s anomaly (a congenital heart disease)
tricuspid valve prolapse
myxomatous degeneration
Marfan�s syndrome
rheumatic fever
rheumatoid arthritis"
tricuspid valve insufficiency,"for tricuspid valve insufficiency, how is tricuspid regurgitation diagnosed??","Your doctor may suspect you have tricuspid regurgitation if you�re experiencing symptoms or if you have other diseases known to lead to the disorder.
During your appointment, your doctor will begin with a physical examination. Your doctor will also listen to your heart for the presence of a heart murmur. This abnormal heart sound can indicate that blood is flowing backward from the heart valve.
After listening to your heart, your doctor may order diagnostic tests. These can help your doctor visualize your heart�s valves. These tests may include:
electrocardiogram
chest X-ray
echocardiogram
transesophageal echocardiogram
cardiac catheterization
radionuclide scan
MRI"
tricuspid valve insufficiency,"for tricuspid valve insufficiency, treatment options for tricuspid regurgitation?","Tricuspid regurgitation does not always need treatment. If your condition is not severe, your doctor may only recommend that you monitor your heart health at regular intervals to make sure the condition doesn�t progress.
Your doctor may prescribe a medication if you have an irregular heartbeat. Tricuspid regurgitation due to heart failure may be treated with medications that strengthen your heartbeat. Swelling can be treated with diuretics to promote the loss of fluids.
It may help to treat any underlying medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, to reduce the symptoms associated with tricuspid regurgitation.
In some instances, tricuspid regurgitation will require surgical repair. Surgeons also can replace the tricuspid valve."
tricuspid valve insufficiency,"for tricuspid valve insufficiency, potential long-term complications?","If left untreated, tricuspid regurgitation can increase your risk of heart failure. It may also lead to weight loss, appetite loss, and cirrhosis of the liver.
Those with tricuspid regurgitation are at a greater risk for endocarditis, an infection of the heart."
tricuspid valve insufficiency,"for tricuspid valve insufficiency, preventing tricuspid regurgitation?","If you have a problem with your tricuspid valve, it�s important to take steps to reduce your risk of endocarditis.
Take good care of your teeth and gums.
Tell all your doctors and dentists that you have a valve disease.
Take antibiotics to prevent infection before any invasive medical procedure or dental work.
Alert your doctor if you experience symptoms of an infection, such as fever, sore throat, and body aches.
Talk to your doctor if you�re experiencing the symptoms of tricuspid regurgitation so you can help keep your heart healthy."

What information do you have on Alzheimer's disease? Could you provide information on Alzheimer's disease?,"What is Alzheimer�s disease?
Alzheimer�s disease is a progressive form of dementia. Dementia is a broader term for conditions that negatively affect memory, thinking, and behavior. The changes interfere with daily living. Dementia can have a range of causes, such as brain injuries or diseases. Sometimes the cause is unknown.
According to the Alzheimer�s Association, Alzheimer�s disease accounts for 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases. Most people with the disease get a diagnosis after age 65. If it�s diagnosed before then, it�s generally referred to as �younger onset� or �early onset� Alzheimer�s disease.
There�s no cure for Alzheimer�s, but there are treatments that can slow the progression of the disease."
Alzheimer's disease,"for Alzheimer's disease, alzheimer�s facts?","Although many people have heard of Alzheimer�s disease, it�s helpful to know the facts. Here are some key details about this condition:
Alzheimer�s disease is a chronic (long-term), ongoing condition. It is not a typical sign of aging.
Alzheimer�s and dementia aren�t the same thing. Alzheimer�s disease is a type of dementia.
Its symptoms come on gradually, and the effects on the brain are degenerative, meaning they cause slow decline.
Anyone can get Alzheimer�s disease, but certain people are at higher risk for it. This includes people over age 65 and those with a family history of the condition.
There�s no single expected outcome for people with Alzheimer�s. Some people live a long time with mild cognitive damage, while others experience a more rapid onset of symptoms and quicker disease progression.
There�s no cure for Alzheimer�s yet, but treatment can help slow the progression of the disease and may improve quality of life.
Each person�s journey with Alzheimer�s disease is different."
Alzheimer's disease,"for Alzheimer's disease, symptoms of alzheimer�s disease?","Everyone has episodes of forgetfulness from time to time. But people with Alzheimer�s disease display certain ongoing behaviors and symptoms that worsen over time. These can include:
memory loss affecting daily activities, such as keeping appointments
trouble with familiar tasks, such as using a microwave
difficulties with problem-solving
trouble with speech or writing
becoming disoriented about times or places
decreased judgment
decreased personal hygiene
mood and personality changes
withdrawal from friends, family, and community
These signs don�t always mean that a person has Alzheimer�s. It�s important to see a doctor to determine the cause.
Symptoms change according to the stage of the disease. In later stages, people with Alzheimer�s often have significant trouble with talking, moving, or responding to what�s happening around them."
Alzheimer's disease,"for Alzheimer's disease, diagnosing alzheimer�s disease?","The only definitive way to diagnose someone with Alzheimer�s disease is to examine their brain tissue after death. But a doctor can use other examinations and tests to assess your mental abilities, diagnose dementia, and rule out other conditions.
The doctor will likely start by taking a medical history. They may ask about your:
symptoms
family medical history
other current or past health conditions
current or past medications
diet, alcohol intake, and other lifestyle habits
From there, your doctor will likely request several tests to help determine if you have Alzheimer�s disease."
Alzheimer's disease,"for Alzheimer's disease, alzheimer�s tests?","There�s no definitive test for Alzheimer�s disease. However, mental, physical, neurological, and imaging tests can help your doctor reach a diagnosis.
Your doctor may start with a mental status test. This can help them assess your:
short-term memory
long-term memory
orientation to place and time
For example, they may ask you:
what day it is
who the president is
to remember and recall a short list of words
Next, they�ll likely conduct a physical exam. For example, they may:
check your blood pressure
assess your heart rate
take your temperature
request urine or blood tests, in some cases
Your doctor may also conduct a neurological exam to rule out other possible diagnoses, such as acute medical issues like infection or stroke. During this exam, they will check your:
reflexes
muscle tone
speech
Your doctor may also order brain imaging studies. These studies, which will create pictures of your brain, can include:
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. MRIs can help pick up key markers, such as inflammation, bleeding, and structural issues.
Computed tomography (CT) scan. CT scans take X-ray images, which can help your doctor look for abnormal characteristics in your brain.
Other tests your doctor may do include blood tests to check for genes that may indicate you have a higher risk of Alzheimer�s disease."
Alzheimer's disease,"for Alzheimer's disease, alzheimer�s medication?","There�s no known cure for Alzheimer�s disease. However, your doctor can recommend medications and other treatments to help ease your symptoms and delay the progression of the disease for as long as possible.
For early to moderate Alzheimer�s, your doctor may prescribe medications such as donepezil (Aricept) or rivastigmine (Exelon). These drugs can help maintain high levels of acetylcholine in your brain. This can help the nerve cells in your brain send and receive signals better. In turn, this may ease some symptoms of Alzheimer�s.
A newer medication called aducanumab (Aduhelm) is recommended only for those with early Alzheimer�s. It is thought to reduce the protein plaques that build up in the brain with Alzheimer�s. However, there are some concerns about whether the drug�s potential benefits outweigh its risks.
To treat moderate to late stage Alzheimer�s, your doctor may prescribe donepezil (Aricept) or memantine (Namenda). Memantine can help block the effects of excess glutamate. Glutamate is a brain chemical that�s released in higher amounts in Alzheimer�s disease and damages brain cells.
Your doctor may also recommend antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, or antipsychotics to help treat symptoms related to Alzheimer�s. These symptoms vary based on the progression of the disease, and can include:
depression
difficulty sleeping at night
agitation
hallucinations
Although the care needs of a person with Alzheimer�s will increase over time, the exact symptoms will be different from person to person."
Alzheimer's disease,"for Alzheimer's disease, other alzheimer�s treatments?","In addition to medication, lifestyle changes can help you manage your condition. For example, your doctor might develop strategies to help you or your loved one:
simplify tasks
limit confusion
get enough rest every day
use relaxation techniques
create a calming environment
Along with your doctor, a team of healthcare professionals can help you maintain your quality of life at all stages along the Alzheimer�s journey. A care team for Alzheimer�s may include a:
physical therapist, to help with staying active
dietician, to maintain a balanced, nutritious diet
pharmacist, to help with monitoring medications
mental health professional, who may work with the person with Alzheimer�s as well as their caregivers
social worker, to help with accessing resources and support
respite care center, to provide short-term care for someone with Alzheimer�s when their caregivers are temporarily unavailable
hospice care center, to manage symptoms in a comfortable and supportive setting at the end of life
Some studies
have suggested that vitamin E could help slow the loss of functioning in Alzheimer�s, especially when taken with medications like donepezil that increase acetylcholine in the brain. But other research found no benefits when taking vitamin E for Alzheimer�s disease. Overall, more evidence is needed.
Be sure to ask your doctor before taking vitamin E or any other supplements. It can interfere with some of the medications used to treat Alzheimer�s disease.
In addition to lifestyle changes, there are several alternative and complementary therapies you can ask your doctor about.
Dementia vs. Alzheimer�s
The terms �dementia� and �Alzheimer�s� are sometimes used interchangeably. However, these two conditions aren�t the same. Alzheimer�s is a type of dementia.
Dementia is a broader term for conditions with symptoms relating to memory loss, such as forgetfulness and confusion. Dementia includes more specific conditions, such as Alzheimer�s disease, Parkinson�s disease, traumatic brain injury, and others, which can cause these symptoms.
Causes, symptoms, and treatments can be different for these conditions.

Alzheimer's disease,"for Alzheimer's disease, alzheimer�s disease causes and risk factors?","Experts haven�t determined a single cause of Alzheimer�s disease, but they have identified certain risk factors, including:
Age. Most people who develop Alzheimer�s disease are 65 years of age or older.
Family history. If you have an immediate family member who has developed the condition, you�re more likely to get it.
Genetics. Certain genes have been linked to Alzheimer�s disease.
Having one or more of these risk factors doesn�t mean that you�ll develop Alzheimer�s disease. It simply raises your risk level.
Other possible risk factors include a history of:
depression
smoking
cardiovascular disease
previous traumatic brain injury
To learn more about your personal risk of developing Alzheimer�s, talk with your doctor."
Alzheimer's disease,"for Alzheimer's disease, alzheimer�s and genetics?","While there�s no one identifiable cause of Alzheimer�s, genetics may play a key role. One gene in particular is of interest to researchers. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a gene that�s been linked to the onset of Alzheimer�s symptoms in older adults.
Blood tests can determine if you have a particular version of this gene, which increases your risk of developing Alzheimer�s. Keep in mind that even if someone has this gene, they may not get Alzheimer�s.
The opposite is also true: Someone may still get Alzheimer�s even if they don�t have the gene. There�s no way to tell for sure whether someone will develop Alzheimer�s.
Other genes could also increase the risk of Alzheimer�s. Several rare genes are linked to certain younger onset cases of the condition."
Alzheimer's disease,"for Alzheimer's disease, alzheimer�s stages?","Alzheimer�s is a progressive disease, which means the symptoms will gradually increase over time. There are seven main stages:
Stages 1�3: Pre-dementia and mild cognitive impairment
Stage 1. There are no symptoms at this stage. If you have a family history of Alzheimer�s and no symptoms, you may wish to talk to a doctor about strategies for healthy aging.
Stage 2. The earliest symptoms appear, such as forgetfulness.
Stage 3. Mild physical and cognitive impairments appear, such as reduced memory and concentration. Learning new skills may become harder. These changes may only be noticeable by someone very close to the person.
Stages 4�7: Dementia
Stage 4. Alzheimer�s is often diagnosed at this stage, but it�s still considered mild. It�s common to notice memory loss and to have difficulty managing everyday tasks.
Stage 5. Moderate to severe symptoms will require help from loved ones or caregivers. This is necessary to ensure that daily needs are being met, such as eating meals and managing the home.
Stage 6. At this stage, a person with Alzheimer�s will need help with basic tasks, such as eating, dressing, and toileting.
Stage 7. This is the most severe and final stage of Alzheimer�s. There is usually a progressive loss of speech and facial expressions. Movement is likely to become limited.
As a person progresses through these stages, they�ll need increasing support from their caregivers.
Talk with your doctor about strategies to help you manage these changes. Appropriate care can help you maintain comfort and quality of life for as long as possible.
It�s also important to discuss your care plan with your loved ones. People with Alzheimer�s will need more assistance with medical decisions as the disease progresses.
People with Alzheimer�s typically live for 4 to 8 years
after diagnosis, though some live for up to 20 years."
Alzheimer's disease,"for Alzheimer's disease, younger onset alzheimer�s?","Alzheimer�s typically affects people ages 65 and older. However, it can occur in people as early as in their 30s, 40s, or 50s. This is called younger onset, or early onset Alzheimer�s. This type of Alzheimer�s affects fewer than 10 percent
of all people with the condition.
Because doctors aren�t always looking for signs of Alzheimer�s in younger adults, getting a diagnosis can take a long time. Symptoms of early onset Alzheimer�s depend on the stage of the disease. Early signs can include mild memory loss and trouble concentrating or finishing everyday tasks. It can be hard to find the right words, and you may lose track of time.
Some studies
have found that certain vision and eye changes could indicate early stage Alzheimer�s disease for people in their 50s and older.
People with a family history of younger onset Alzheimer�s are at greater risk of developing this condition. There are several rare genes that, together, cause groups of cases in some families. People with a family history of Alzheimer�s should talk with their doctor."
Alzheimer's disease,"for Alzheimer's disease, preventing alzheimer�s?","Just as there�s no known cure for Alzheimer�s, there are no foolproof preventive measures. For now, health-promoting lifestyle habits are the best tools we have to prevent cognitive decline.
The following steps may help:
Try to quit smoking. If you smoke, quitting benefits your health both immediately and in the long term.
Exercise regularly. Getting active reduces the risk of many conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
Keep your brain active. Try some cognitive training exercises.
Eat well. Eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables.
Maintain an active social life. Friendships, volunteering, and hobbies are likely to benefit your overall health.
Be sure to talk with your doctor before making any big changes in your lifestyle."
Alzheimer's disease,"for Alzheimer's disease, alzheimer�s care?","As Alzheimer�s progresses, the tasks of daily living require more support. If you have a loved one with Alzheimer�s, it�s important to start learning about what to expect and what your role may be in your loved one�s future care. Caregiving is a role that�s typically not easy, but it can also be very rewarding.
If your loved one has Alzheimer�s, here are some ways to plan and prepare for caregiving:
Educate yourself about Alzheimer�s, its stages, and its typical symptoms. By reading this article, you�re already on the right track.
Connect with family members who can step in to help.
Consider joining a support group for dementia caregivers.
Look up professional home care, respite care, and adult day care programs in your area.
Remember that you�ll need support too. Reach out to the people you�re close to, and be open to accepting help.
As a caregiver, it�s important to take care of yourself as well as your loved one. Caregiving has its difficult moments, and the strain of ongoing responsibilities can start to negatively affect your health. As much as possible, a robust care plan should include support for you, too.
Alzheimer�s statistics
Alzheimer�s disease has a large impact in the United States.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
, Alzheimer�s is the fifth most common cause of death for people 65 years and older in the United States.
As of 2021, it�s estimated that 6.2 million
Americans over the age of 65 have Alzheimer�s. By the year 2060, that number could reach 13.8 million.
Alzheimer�s is an expensive disease. According to the CDC, about $355 billion
was spent on Alzheimer�s and dementia care costs in the United States in 2021.

What are the symptoms of oral thrush in babies?
Oral thrush most often affects infants and toddlers. About 65%
of infants have Candida albicans (C. albicans). fungus in their mouths. About 5-7% of babies under one month old will develop the infection.
Babies can contract the fungus from their birthing parent during pregnancy, delivery, or nursing or just from yeast that is naturally present in their environment.
If your baby has oral thrush, it may develop the same signs and symptoms that can affect adults with the condition. It may also cause difficulty feeding and irritability or fussiness.
Read more about thrush in babies, as well as thrush and breastfeeding or chestfeeding."
candidiasis or oral candidiasis,"for candidiasis or oral candidiasis, what causes oral thrush??","Oral thrush and other yeast infections are caused by an overgrowth of C. albicans. It exists naturally in the microbiomes of 50%
of the population.
It�s typical for a small amount of C. albicans to live in your mouth without causing harm. When your immune system is working properly, beneficial bacteria in your body help keep C. albicans under control.
But if your immune system is compromised or the balance of microorganisms in your body is disrupted, the fungus can grow out of control."
candidiasis or oral candidiasis,"for candidiasis or oral candidiasis, what are the risk factors for oral thrush??","Oral thrush is the most common opportunistic infection in people living with HIV. It can also develop with other conditions or medications that weaken your immune system, such as:
cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy
cancer like leukemia
uncontrolled diabetes
Other risk factors include:
being a baby or older adult
having a condition that causes dry mouth
taking corticosteroids, or immunosuppressant drugs
smoking
wearing dentures
taking antibiotics"
candidiasis or oral candidiasis,"for candidiasis or oral candidiasis, what are the complications of oral thrush??","If your immune system is weakened, you�re more likely to develop complications from thrush.
Without proper treatment, the fungus that causes thrush may enter your bloodstream and spread to your heart, brain, eyes, or other body parts. This is known as invasive or systemic candidiasis.
Systemic candidiasis can cause problems in the organs it affects. It can also cause
a potentially life threatening condition known as septic shock."
candidiasis or oral candidiasis,"for candidiasis or oral candidiasis, how do you treat oral thrush??","To treat oral thrush, your doctor may prescribe medications. These include:
fluconazole (Diflucan)
generic nystatin

Learn more about antifungal medications.
Once you begin treatment, oral thrush usually goes away within a couple of weeks. But in some cases, it can return.
For adults who have recurring cases of oral thrush with no known cause, their healthcare professional will evaluate them for underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to thrush.
Infants may have several episodes of oral thrush in their first year of life.
In addition, your doctor may also recommend some home remedies for oral thrush.
Treatment for babies and nursing parents
If your baby develops oral thrush or you develop a breast or nipple yeast infection, your healthcare professional may advise you to do the following:
Treat your baby with antifungal medications and apply an antifungal cream to your breasts. Make sure to wipe the cream off your breasts before nursing.
Sterilize your baby�s pacifiers, teething rings, bottle nipples, breast pump pieces, and any other items they put in their mouth.
Keep your nipples clean and dry between feedings. If you use nursing pads, avoid those that have a plastic liner, which may trap moisture and create favorable conditions for fungus to grow."
candidiasis or oral candidiasis,"for candidiasis or oral candidiasis, how do doctors diagnose oral thrush??","Your doctor may be able to diagnose oral thrush simply by taking a history of your symptoms

Could you describe what neuropathy is? I�d like to know more about neuropathy. Can you help? What information do you have on neuropathy? Could you provide information on neuropathy?,"Peripheral neuropathy occurs when these nerves don�t work properly because they�re damaged or destroyed. They might send pain signals for no reason, or not send a signal when you�re experiencing harm.
Read on to learn about the types of peripheral neuropathy, its symptoms, causes, treatment, and more."
neuropathy,"for neuropathy, what are the types of peripheral neuropathy??","Your peripheral nervous system connects the nerves from your brain and spinal cord, or central nervous system, to the rest of your body. This includes your:
arms and hands
legs and feet
face and mouth
internal organs
The job of these nerves is to deliver signals about physical sensations back to your brain. They also make sure your body�s internal functions, like blood circulation and food digestion, work as they should.
Peripheral neuropathy can be caused by:
injury
systemic illness
infection
hormonal imbalance
certain medications
vitamin deficiency
an inherited disorder
The causes are therefore vast, as are the types of the condition. More than 100
different types of peripheral neuropathy exist. Each type has unique symptoms and specific treatment options.
Medical researchers also classify peripheral neuropathies further classified by the type of nerve damage involved. Mononeuropathy occurs when only one nerve is damaged. Polyneuropathies, which are more common, happen when multiple nerves are damaged.
The disorder is uncomfortable, but treatments can be very helpful. The most important thing to determine is whether the neuropathy is the result of a serious underlying condition."
neuropathy,"for neuropathy, what are the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy??","There are three types of nerves in the body. Since there are so many types of peripheral neuropathy, doctors will diagnose your type by the group of nerves it affects. The three groups are:
Motor. These nerves are responsible for muscle movement, like walking, talking, or using your hands or arms.
Sensory. These are responsible for sensory information, like hot or cold, pain, or touch.
Autonomic. These are responsible for body processes you don�t see, like breathing, heartbeat, and digestion.
Peripheral neuropathy can affect one nerve group, two groups, or all three. Sometimes it will affect one nerve only, and that�s called mononeuropathy.
The symptoms of peripheral neuropathy depend on the kind of neuropathy.
Motor neuropathy symptoms include:
muscle cramps
twitching
muscle weakness
foot drop
muscle wasting
paralysis
Sensory neuropathy symptoms include:
prickling and tingling sensation, or �pins and needles�
numbness
reduced sensations of pain or hot and cold
increased pain from things that shouldn�t cause pain, like light touch
burning or sharp pain
loss of balance or coordination
Autonomic neuropathy symptoms include:
constipation or diarrhea
bloating, belching, or feeling of sickness
faint or dizziness upon standing from low blood pressure
rapid heart rate
sweating too much or too little
problems with sexual function
loss of bowel control
difficulty emptying bladder completely
Symptoms can cause challenges in daily life, like trouble walking or sleeping because of pain in the feet and legs.
These symptoms can also indicate other conditions. Make sure you tell your doctor about all of your symptoms so they can find the right diagnosis and the best treatment."
neuropathy,"for neuropathy, what are the causes of peripheral neuropathy??","A variety of factors and underlying conditions can cause
this condition. In rare cases, peripheral neuropathy is genetic, but most cases are acquired.
An acquired case of peripheral neuropathy is often idiopathic, which means doctors don�t know why it�s happening. In most cases, doctors can connect the condition to one or more causes.
Generalized diseases
Nerve damage caused by diabetes is one of the most common forms of neuropathy. This leads to numbness, pain, and a loss of sensation in the extremities.
The American Diabetes Association recommends taking these steps to delay or prevent nerve damage:
Monitor your blood sugar level to keep it in target range and to assess whether your diabetes care plan is on track.
Inspect your feet for signs of injury, infection, or hot spots.
Report signs of neuropathy to your doctor and get early treatment.
Protect your feet with special shoes and take care when washing and exercising.
According to the National Institutes of Health, 60 to 70 percent
of people with diabetes have some sort of nerve damage.
Other chronic diseases that may cause nerve damage include:
autoimmune diseases like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis
kidney or liver disorders
vascular and blood disorders
Injury
Physical trauma is a common cause of injury to the nerves. This can include car accidents, falls, or fractures. Inactivity, or holding still too long in one position, can also cause neuropathy.
Increased pressure on the median nerve, a nerve in the wrist that supplies feeling and movement to the hand, causes carpal tunnel syndrome. This is a common type
of peripheral neuropathy.
Alcohol and toxins
Alcohol can have a toxic effect on nerve tissue, putting people with severe alcohol use disorder at a higher risk of peripheral neuropathy.
Exposure to toxic chemicals like glue, solvents, or insecticides, either through chemical abuse or in the workplace, can also cause nerve damage. Additionally, exposure to heavy metals such as lead and mercury can also cause this condition.
Infections and autoimmune disorders
Certain viruses and bacteria directly attack nerve tissue.
Viruses such as herpes simplex, varicella-zoster virus (which causes chickenpox and shingles), and Epstein-Barr virus damage sensory nerves and cause intense episodes of shooting pain.
Bacterial infections such as Lyme disease can also cause nerve damage and pain if they aren�t treated. People with HIV or AIDS can also develop peripheral neuropathy.
Autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus affect the peripheral nervous system in various ways. Chronic inflammation and damage to tissues throughout the body, as well as pressure caused by inflammation, can all lead to severe nerve pain in the extremities.
Medications
Certain medications may also cause nerve damage. These include:
anticonvulsants, which people take to treat seizures
drugs to fight bacterial infections
some blood pressure medications
medications used to treat cancer
A 2020 study found that although there�s no direct evidence that statins, a class of drugs used to lower cholesterol and prevent cardiovascular disease, cause neuropathy, statins may increase the risk of neuropathy from other causes."
neuropathy,"for neuropathy, how is peripheral neuropathy diagnosed??","First, your doctor will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history. They might perform
other tests, which include:
Electromyography
Electromyography can show problems with how your body�s nerve signals move to your muscles.
For this test, your doctor will place a small needle into your muscle. Your doctor will then ask you to move your muscle gently. Probes in the needle will measure the amount of electricity moving through your muscle.
This test may feel like you�re receiving a shot. Sometimes the area becomes sore for a few days afterward.
Nerve conduction study
In a nerve conduction study, your doctor places electrodes on your skin. They then pulse tiny amounts of electricity through your nerves to see if the nerves are transmitting signals properly.
This procedure is slightly uncomfortable while it�s happening, but it shouldn�t hurt afterward.
If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here."
neuropathy,"for neuropathy, what are the treatment options for peripheral neuropathy??","Treatment for the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy focuses on treating
the underlying disorder. If diabetes is the cause, the focus is on blood sugar control. If a vitamin deficiency is causing the problem, then correcting the deficiency is the treatment.
Many treatments can bring relief and help you return to your regular activities. Sometimes a combination of treatments works best.
Pain medications
Over-the-counter (OTC) oral pain medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, can be very helpful in controlling moderate pain.
If you take them in excess, these drugs can affect your liver or stomach function. It�s important to avoid using them for an extended period, especially if you drink alcohol regularly.
The Foundation for Peripheral Neuropathy includes a list of additional topical OTC medications you may consider trying. They include:
Absorbine Jr. This is a blend of menthol and other herbal ingredients that can soothe muscle pain. Other menthol-based creams may also help. They include Flex-All, Flexgen, Tiger Balm, or Vicks VapoRub.
Capsaicin cream. This cream contains chili pepper oils, which create a heating effect that helps relieve pain for some people. There are brands and formulations.
Neuragen PN. Made from botanical oils, this cream is meant specifically for nerve pain on hands and feet.
Sore No More. This is another botanical anesthetic that may provide some relieve for neuropathic discomfort.
Prescription medication
Many prescription pain medications can also help to control the pain of this condition. These include narcotics, some antiepileptic medications, and some antidepressants. Other helpful prescription medications include:
lidocaine in a patch on the affected area
pregabalin (an anti-epileptic medication)
duloxetine (an antidepressant)
steroids
anesthetics
Prescription drugs for sexual dysfunction in men due to nerve damage include phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5Is) like:
sildenafil
vardenafil
tadalafil
avanafil
Medical treatments
Your doctor can use several medical treatments to control the symptoms of this condition. Plasmapheresis is a blood transfusion that removes potentially irritating antibodies from your bloodstream.
If you get a nerve block, your doctor will inject an anesthetic directly into your nerves.
Transcutaneous electronic nerve stimulation (TENS)
Transcutaneous electronic nerve stimulation (TENS) doesn�t work for everyone, but many people like it because it�s a drug-free therapy.
During TENS, electrodes placed on the skin send small amounts of electricity into the skin. The goal of this treatment is to disrupt nerves from transmitting pain signals to the brain.
Ergonomic casts or splints
Ergonomic casts or splints can help you if your neuropathy affects your muscles. Splints can help with:
muscle weakness
stability
These casts provide support for the part of your body that�s uncomfortable. This can relieve pain. For example, a cast or splint that holds your wrists in a proper position while you sleep can relieve the discomfort of carpal tunnel syndrome.
Self-care
In addition to OTC pain relievers, many people have found relief for peripheral neuropathy through:
having a foot bath with chamomile or nettle leaves for at least 30 minutes
using a heating pad or electric socks
applying an ice pack to affected areas for 10 minutes twice daily in the morning and the evening
trying acupuncture
undergoing biofeedback
trying different types of holistic therapy such as reflexology, tai chi, or reiki
massaging affected areas to promote circulation
avoiding pressure on the affected area, like not crossing legs or leaning on elbows
seeking social support and activities with others
setting priorities daily and not doing more than you feel you are capable of
avoiding caffeine and developing a regular bedtime routine to promote sleep
Moderate, regular exercise can also help lessen discomfort.
If you drink alcohol or smoke, consider cutting back or stopping. Both alcohol and tobacco aggravate nerve pain and can cause nerve damage when used for long periods.
Take precautions at home
If you have peripheral neuropathy, you�re potentially at greater risk for accidents in the home. You can do the following to improve your safety:
Use safety guards and other tools for sharp objects like scissors and knives.
Use thermometers to measure the temperature of bath or tap water.
Use potholders and gloves when handling hot items.
Use a walker or cane for added stability.
Install nightlights to avoid tripping in the dark.
Carefully wrap your hands and feet when it�s cold out."
neuropathy,"for neuropathy, what is the long-term outlook??","If your neuropathy is due to an underlying, treatable condition, you may be able to stop your peripheral neuropathy by treating the larger problem.
However, if this isn�t the case for you, you can successfully manage the symptoms of your peripheral neuropathy. Speak with your doctor to determine the best medical treatment for you, and explore complementary and self-care options that can supplement your medical care."
neuropathy,"for neuropathy, how can i prevent peripheral neuropathy??","You can take steps to prevent
peripheral neuropathy and lower your risk by:
talking with your doctor about genetic risk and steps to prevent onset of hereditary neuropathy
asking about medications that have lower neuropathy risk
getting vaccinated for conditions like shingles that can cause neuropathy
treating the underlying cause of neuropathy, like managing blood sugar if you have diabetes
quitting smoking to promote healthy circulation
avoiding caffeine to improve sleep
Eating healthy to prevent vitamin deficiency and support vascular health is of particular importance. Keeping a balanced diet that includes all the food groups is your best course of action.
However, the Foundation for Peripheral Neuropathy has a list of some specific nutrients and vitamins to look out for in your food that may play a role in improving some symptoms
If you have diabetes, take special care of your feet. Wash and inspect your feet daily, and keep the skin moist with lotion."
neuropathy,"for neuropathy, the takeaway?","Peripheral neuropathy is the result of damage to one or more groups of nerves. The effect on your body depends on which nerve groups aren�t working the way they should.
An injury, systemic illness, and medications are all potential causes. By treating the underlying reason for neuropathy, you can delay its onset or stop it from getting worse. Self-care strategies like daily planning can help you manage the condition and improve daily life."

Could you provide information on kidney disease?,"Kidney failure occurs when your kidneys lose the ability to filter waste from your blood sufficiently. It may not cause symptoms in the early stages.
Your kidneys filter your blood and remove toxins from your body. These toxins go to your bladder and are eliminated when you urinate. When this doesn�t work properly, you can get kidney failure.
If your kidneys aren�t able to function properly, toxins can overwhelm your body. This can lead to kidney failure, which can be life threatening if left untreated.
Keep reading as we break down everything you need to know about kidney failure, including symptoms, stages, treatment, and the typical outlook."
kidney disease,"for kidney disease, types of kidney failure?","Acute kidney failure occurs when your kidneys suddenly stop working properly while chronic kidney failure occurs over time. Doctors typically divide kidney failure into five types.
The types of kidney failure include:
Acute prerenal kidney failure: Insufficient blood flow to the kidneys can cause acute prerenal kidney failure. Doctors can usually cure this type once they determine the cause of the decreased blood flow.
Acute intrinsic kidney failure: Acute intrinsic kidney failure can result from direct trauma to the kidneys, such as physical impact or an accident, toxin overload, and ischemia, which is a lack of oxygen to the kidneys.
Chronic prerenal kidney failure: When there isn�t enough blood flowing to your kidneys for an extended period of time, the kidneys can shrink and lose the ability to function.
Chronic intrinsic kidney failure: This happens when there�s long-term damage to the kidneys due to intrinsic kidney disease. Intrinsic kidney disease develops from direct trauma to the kidneys, such as severe bleeding or a lack of oxygen.
Chronic post-renal kidney failure: A long-term blockage of the urinary tract prevents urination. This causes pressure and eventual kidney damage.
Acute post-renal kidney failure: This type of kidney failure can occur due to stones or another blockage in the urinary tract."
kidney disease,"for kidney disease, symptoms of kidney failure?","Early-stage kidney failure often doesn�t cause noticeable symptoms. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
, about 90% of people with chronic kidney disease don�t know they have it.
As kidney disease progresses, symptoms may include:
reduced amount of urine
swelling of your legs, ankles, and feet from fluid retention
shortness of breath
trouble sleeping
muscle cramping at night
excessive drowsiness or fatigue
persistent nausea
confusion
chest pain or pressure
seizures
coma
Early signs of kidney failure
Symptoms of early-stage kidney disease may be subtle and hard to identify. They may include:
decreased urine output
swelling in limbs
shortness of breath
Kidney failure urine color
The color of your urine doesn�t tell you much about the state of your kidney function until damage to the kidneys has progressed.
Still, urine color changes may be an early indicator of some issues.
Urine color Indication
clear or pale yellow well-hydrated
dark yellow or amber dehydrated
orange dehydration or bile in the bloodstream
pink or red blood in the urine or having eaten certain foods, like beets
foamy contains a lot of protein; potentially an indicator of kidney disease"
kidney disease,"for kidney disease, causes of kidney failure?","Kidney failure can result from various causes. According to the National Kidney Foundation, the two most common include high blood pressure and diabetes.
People who are most at risk usually have one or more of the following:
Loss of blood flow to the kidneys
A sudden loss of blood flow to your kidneys can prompt kidney failure. Some causes include:
heart attack
heart disease
scarring of the liver or liver failure
dehydration
severe burns
allergic reactions
severe infection, such as sepsis
High blood pressure and anti-inflammatory medications can also limit blood flow.
Urine elimination problems
When your body can�t eliminate urine, toxins build up and overload the kidneys. Some cancers can block the urine passageways, such as:
prostate
colon
cervical
bladder
Other conditions can interfere with urination and possibly lead to kidney failure, including:
kidney stones
enlarged prostate
blood clots within your urinary tract
damage to the nerves that control your bladder
Other causes
Other factors that may lead to kidney failure include:
a blood clot in or around your kidneys
heavy metal poisoning
drugs and alcohol use
vasculitis, an inflammation of the blood vessels
lupus, an autoimmune disease that can cause inflammation of many body organs
glomerulonephritis, an inflammation of the small blood vessels of the kidneys
hemolytic uremic syndrome, which involves the breakdown of red blood cells following a bacterial infection, usually of the intestines
multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cells in your bone marrow
scleroderma, an autoimmune condition that affects your skin
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a disorder that causes blood clots in small vessels
chemotherapy drugs that treat cancer and some autoimmune diseases
dyes used in some imaging tests
certain antibiotics
unmanaged diabetes"
kidney disease,"for kidney disease, who gets kidney failure??","People of all ages develop kidney failure, but the risk increases
with age. According to the CDC, 14%
of U.S. adults have chronic kidney failure.
You may have a higher risk if you have:
diabetes
high blood pressure
heart disease
a family history of kidney failure
The longer you�ve had these conditions, the greater your risk
of chronic kidney failure."
kidney disease,"for kidney disease, diagnostic tests?","Doctors use several tests to diagnose kidney failure. Common tests include:
Urinalysis: A urine sample can show how much protein or sugar is in your urine. A urinary sediment examination looks for red and white blood cells, high levels of bacteria, and high numbers of cellular casts.
Urine volume measurements: Measuring urine output can help diagnose kidney failure. Low output may suggest that kidney disease is due to a urinary blockage.
Blood samples: Blood tests can measure substances filtered by your kidneys, such as blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. A rapid rise in these levels may indicate acute kidney failure.
Imaging: Tests like ultrasounds, MRIs, and CT scans provide images of your kidneys and urinary tract to identify issues.
Kidney tissue sample: Doctors use a kidney biopsy to collect and examine tissue samples."
kidney disease,"for kidney disease, chronic kidney disease stages?","Kidney disease is classified into five stages. These range from very mild (stage 1) to complete kidney failure (stage 5). Symptoms and complications increase as the stages progress.
Stage 1
You may experience no symptoms and have no visible complications. But some kidney damage is present.
Stage 2
Stage 2 kidney disease is still considered mild, but detectable issues like protein in the urine or physical damage to the kidneys may be more obvious.
It�s also a good idea to talk with a doctor about risk factors that could make the disease progress more rapidly, such as:
heart disease
inflammation
blood disorders
Stage 3
At this stage, your kidneys aren�t working as well as they should.
Stage 3 kidney disease is sometimes divided into stages 3a and 3b. A blood test that measures the amount of waste products in your body helps doctors differentiate between the two.
Symptoms may become more apparent. Swelling in hands and feet, back pain, and changes to urination frequency are likely.
A doctor may consider medications to treat underlying conditions that could speed kidney failure.
Stage 4
Stage 4 kidney disease is considered moderate to severe. The kidneys aren�t working well, but you�re not in complete kidney failure yet. Symptoms can include complications like:
anemia
high blood pressure
bone disease
A doctor will likely develop a treatment plan to slow kidney damage.
Stage 5
In stage 5, your kidneys are nearing or in complete failure. Symptoms of the loss of kidney function will be evident, such as vomiting and nausea, trouble breathing, and itchy skin.
You�ll need regular dialysis or a kidney transplant.
The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
estimates that approximately 1 in 500 Americans has stage 5 kidney failure."
kidney disease,"for kidney disease, treatment?","The type of treatment you need depends on the cause and stage of your kidney failure.
Dialysis
Dialysis filters and purifies the blood using a machine to performs the function of the kidneys. Depending on the type of dialysis, you may be connected to a large machine or a portable catheter bag.
Along with dialysis, you may need to follow a low potassium, low salt diet.
Dialysis doesn�t cure kidney failure, but going to regularly scheduled treatments can extend your life.
Kidney transplant
A transplanted kidney can work fully, so you no longer need dialysis.
There�s usually a long wait to receive a donor kidney that�s compatible with your body. If you have a living donor, the process may go more quickly.
Transplant surgery might not be the right treatment option for everyone. It is not always successful.
You must take immunosuppressant drugs after the surgery to prevent your body from rejecting the new kidney. These drugs have their own side effects, some of which can be serious.
You can talk with a doctor about whether you�re a good candidate for a kidney transplant.
Lifestyle modifications
Minimizing your intake of alcohol and making dietary changes may help prevent kidney failure from progressing.
At the early stages and beyond, it�s possible to manage and slow progression with lifestyle factors such as:
Dietary changes
The guidelines for what you eat will often depend on the stage of kidney disease you have and your overall health. Some recommendations might include:
Limiting sodium and potassium: Aim to eat less than 2,000 milligrams per day of both sodium (salt) and potassium.
Limiting phosphorus: Try to stay below 1,000 milligrams
of phosphorus.
Following protein guidelines: In early and moderate kidney disease, you might want to cut back on protein consumption. But you may eat more protein in end-stage kidney failure, depending on your doctor�s recommendations.
Beyond these general guidelines, a doctor may also ask you to avoid certain foods.
Lowering alcohol intake
If you have kidney failure and drink alcohol, your kidneys must work harder than they already do. Alcohol doesn�t metabolize out of your system, so if you have complete kidney failure, you�ll feel its effects until you receive dialysis to filter it from your blood.
Beer, ale, and wine also contain large amounts of phosphorous. Severe heart issues and death are possible if your kidneys cannot filter it out.
If you have kidney failure or late-stage kidney disease, a doctor may recommend you limit alcohol. Eliminating alcohol from your diet, if possible, may be best."
kidney disease,"for kidney disease, diabetes and kidney failure?","Diabetes is the most common cause of kidney failure. About one-third of adults
with diabetes have kidney disease.
Without management, high blood sugar can damage your kidneys. The damage can worsen over time.
Diabetic nephropathy, or kidney damage caused by type 1 or type 2 diabetes, can�t be reversed. Steps to prevent or limit kidney damage can include:
managing your blood sugar
managing blood pressure
taking medications as prescribed
If you have diabetes, a doctor will likely perform regular screenings to monitor for kidney failure. Your risk for diabetic nephropathy increases the longer you live with diabetes."
kidney disease,"for kidney disease, complications?","Kidney failure can lead to various complications. These can include:
anemia
bone weakness, due to an imbalance of phosphorus and calcium
fluid retention (edema)
heart disease
high potassium levels (hyperkalemia)
metabolic acidosis, when the blood becomes too acidic
Many people with kidney failure develop secondary complications. These can include:
depression
liver failure
fluid buildup in the lungs
gout
nerve damage
skin infections"
kidney disease,"for kidney disease, kidney failure outlook?","It�s not possible to know precisely how long a person with kidney failure will live, as it can depend on many factors.
These include:
the underlying cause
how well that underlying cause is managed
any complicating factors, like high blood pressure or diabetes
stage of kidney disease at diagnosis
age
The National Kidney Foundation says that a person on dialysis can expect to live for an average of 5 to 10 years as long as they follow their treatment. Some people live for more than 20 or 30 years.
Once you reach end-stage kidney failure, you will need dialysis or a kidney transplant to live. Missing even one dialysis treatment can decrease your life expectancy.
Proper treatment and healthy lifestyle changes may improve your outlook, such as avoiding certain foods."
kidney disease,"for kidney disease, kidney failure prevention?","You can take steps to lower the risk of kidney failure.
Follow directions when taking over-the-counter medications. Taking doses that are too high, even of common drugs like aspirin, can create high toxin levels quickly. This can overload your kidneys.
Many kidney or urinary tract conditions lead to kidney failure without prompt treatment.
You can help lower your risk of kidney failure by:
eating a balanced diet
maintaining a moderate weight
taking prescribed and over-the-counter medications as directed and not taking more medication than is safe
keeping conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, well managed and following a doctor�s advice"
kidney disease,"for kidney disease, the bottom line?","Kidney failure can develop suddenly or from long-term damage. Possible causes of kidney failure can include diabetes, high blood pressure, and kidney trauma.
Kidney disease is classified into five stages, ranging from mild to complete kidney failure. Symptoms and complications increase as the stages progress.
If you have kidney failure, you can work with a doctor to determine the best treatment options."
glaucoma,what is glaucoma? Tell me about glaucoma? What kind of disease is glaucoma? Can you elaborate on glaucoma? What can you tell me about glaucoma? Could you describe what glaucoma is? I�d like to know more about glaucoma. Can you help? What information do you have on glaucoma? Could you provide information on glaucoma?,"What Is Glaucoma?
Glaucoma is an eye disease that can damage your optic nerve. The optic nerve supplies visual information to your brain from your eyes.
Glaucoma is usually, but not always, the result of abnormally high pressure inside your eye. Over time, the increased pressure can erode your optic nerve tissue, which may lead to vision loss or even blindness. If it�s caught early, you may be able to prevent additional vision loss."
glaucoma,"for glaucoma, what are the symptoms of glaucoma??","The most common type of glaucoma is primary open-angle glaucoma. It has no signs or symptoms except gradual vision loss. For that reason, it�s important that you go to yearly comprehensive eye exams so your ophthalmologist, or eye specialist, can monitor any changes in your vision.
Acute-angle closure glaucoma, which is also known as narrow-angle glaucoma, is a medical emergency. See your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms:
severe eye pain
nausea
vomiting
redness in your eye
sudden vision disturbances
seeing colored rings around lights
sudden blurred vision"
glaucoma,"for glaucoma, what causes glaucoma??","The back of your eye continuously makes a clear fluid called aqueous humor. As this fluid is made, it fills the front part of your eye. Then, it leaves your eye through channels in your cornea and iris. If these channels are blocked or partially obstructed, the natural pressure in your eye, which is called the intraocular pressure (IOP), may increase. As your IOP increases, your optic nerve may become damaged. As damage to your nerve progresses, you may begin losing sight in your eye.
What causes the pressure in your eye to increase isn�t always known. However, doctors believe one or more of these factors may play a role:
dilating eye drops
blocked or restricted drainage in your eye
medications, such as corticosteroids
poor or reduced blood flow to your optic nerve
high or elevated blood pressure"
glaucoma,"for glaucoma, what are the types of glaucoma??","Five major types of glaucoma exist. These are:
Open-Angle (Chronic) Glaucoma
Open-angle, or chronic, glaucoma has no signs or symptoms except gradual vision loss. This loss may be so slow that your vision can suffer irreparable damage before any other signs become apparent. According the National Eye Institute (NEI)
, this is the most common type of glaucoma.
Angle-Closure (Acute) Glaucoma
If the flow of your aqueous humor fluid is suddenly blocked, the rapid buildup of fluid may cause a severe, quick, and painful increase in pressure. Angle-closure glaucoma is an emergency situation. You should call your doctor immediately if you begin experiencing symptoms, such as severe pain, nausea, and blurred vision.
Congenital Glaucoma
Children born with congenital glaucoma have a defect in the angle of their eye, which slows or prevents normal fluid drainage. Congenital glaucoma usually presents with symptoms, such as cloudy eyes, excessive tearing, or sensitivity to light. Congenital glaucoma can run in families.
Secondary Glaucoma
Secondary glaucoma is often a side effect of injury or another eye condition, such as cataracts or eye tumors. Medicines, such as corticosteroids, may also cause this type of glaucoma. Rarely, eye surgery can cause secondary glaucoma.
Normal Tension Glaucoma
In some cases, people without increased eye pressure develop damage to their optic nerve. The cause of this isn�t known. However, extreme sensitivity or a lack of blood flow to your optic nerve may be a factor in this type of glaucoma."
glaucoma,"for glaucoma, who is at risk of glaucoma??","According to the World Health Organization
(WHO), glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness around the world. The risk factors for glaucoma include:
Age
People over 60 are at increased risk of glaucoma, warns the NEI
, and the risk of glaucoma increases slightly with each year of age. If you�re African-American, your increase in risk begins at age 40.
Ethnicity
African-Americans or people of African descent are significantly more likely to develop glaucoma than Caucasians. People of Asian descent are at a higher risk of angle-closure glaucoma, and people of Japanese descent have a higher risk of developing low-tension glaucoma.
Eye Problems
Chronic eye inflammation and thin corneas can lead to increased pressure in your eyes. Physical injury or trauma to your eye, such as being hit in your eye, can also cause your eye pressure to increase.
Family History
Some types of glaucoma may run in families. If your parent or grandparent had open-angle glaucoma, you�re at an increased risk of developing the condition.
Medical History
People with diabetes and those with high blood pressure and heart disease have an increased risk of developing glaucoma.
Use of Certain Medicine
Using corticosteroids for extended periods may increase your risk of developing secondary glaucoma."
glaucoma,"for glaucoma, how is glaucoma diagnosed??","To diagnose glaucoma, your ophthalmologist will want to perform a comprehensive eye examination. They�ll check for signs of deterioration, including loss of nerve tissue. They may also use one or more of the following tests and procedures:
Detailed Medical History
Your doctor will want to know what symptoms you�ve been experiencing and if you have any personal or family history of glaucoma. They�ll also ask for a general health assessment to determine if any other health conditions may be impacting your eye health, such as diabetes or high blood pressure.
Tonometry Test
This class of tests measures your eye�s internal pressure.
Pachymetry Test
People with thin corneas have an increased risk of developing glaucoma. A pachymetry test can tell your doctor if your corneas are thinner than average.
Perimetry Test
This test, also known as a visual field test, can tell your doctor if glaucoma is affecting your vision by measuring your peripheral, or side, vision and your central vision.
Monitoring Your Optic Nerve
If your doctor wants to monitor for gradual changes to your optic nerve, they may take photographs of your optic nerve to conduct a side-by-side comparison over time."
glaucoma,"for glaucoma, how is glaucoma treated??","The goal of glaucoma treatment is to reduce IOP to stop any additional eyesight loss. Typically, your doctor will begin treatment with prescription eye drops. If these don�t work or more advanced treatment is needed, your doctor may suggest one of the following treatments:
Medications
Several medicines designed to reduce IOP are available. These medicines are available in the form of eye drops or pills, but the drops are more common. Your doctor may prescribe one or a combination of these.
Surgery
If a blocked or slow channel is causing increased IOP, your doctor may suggest surgery to make a drainage path for fluid or destroy tissues that are responsible for the increased fluid.
Treatment for angle-closure glaucoma is different. This type of glaucoma is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment to reduce eye pressure as quickly as possible. Medicines are usually attempted first, to reverse the angle closure, but this may be unsuccessful. A laser procedure called laser peripheral iridotomy may also be performed. This procedure creates small holes in your iris to allow for increased fluid movement."
glaucoma,"for glaucoma, will a person with glaucoma go blind??","If your increased IOP can be stopped and the pressure returned to normal, vision loss can be slowed or even stopped. However, because there�s no cure for glaucoma, you�ll likely need treatment for the rest of your life to regulate your IOP. Unfortunately, vision lost as a result of glaucoma cannot be restored."
glaucoma,"for glaucoma, can glaucoma be prevented??","Glaucoma can�t be prevented, but it�s still important to catch it early so you can begin treatment that will help prevent it from getting worse. The best way to catch any type of glaucoma early is to have an annual preventive eye care appointment. Make an appointment with an ophthalmologist. Simple tests performed during these routine eye checks may be able to detect damage from glaucoma before it advances and begins causing vision loss."

What can you tell me about neoplasm metastasis? Could you describe what neoplasm metastasis is? I�d like to know more about neoplasm metastasis. Can you help? What information do you have on neoplasm metastasis? Could you provide information on neoplasm metastasis?,"Metastatic cancer is cancer that has spread from its original location to a distant part of the body. Most metastatic cancers are not curable, although people with well-controlled metastatic cancer can live for many years.
Metastatic cancers are serious and difficult to treat. While most are incurable, they can be managed for months or even years with the right treatment. And certain kinds of metastatic cancer, such as testicular cancer, can be curable.
This article takes a closer look at metastatic cancers, where they�re likely to spread, and why the outlook for people with metastatic cancers can vary so much."
neoplasm metastasis,"for neoplasm metastasis, what is metastatic cancer??","The first cancerous tumor that develops is the primary tumor. This tumor can grow big enough to push into nearby tissue and organs. Also, cells can break away from the tumor and spread through tissue to form new tumors in nearby tissues, organs, or lymph nodes.
Cancer cells can also enter your bloodstream or lymphatic system. From there, they can travel just about anywhere in your body. When tumors form in a distant part of your body, you have metastatic cancer. For many types of cancer, metastatic cancer is also known as stage 4 cancer.
Most of the time, metastatic cancer is not curable, though many cases are treatable. People with well-controlled metastatic cancer can live for many years.
Advanced vs. metastatic cancer
Advanced cancer is typically cancer that cannot be cured. Advanced cancer can be locally advanced or metastatic. For example, some large brain tumors may be advanced even though they have not spread beyond the brain.
Metastatic cancer is cancer that has spread from the original tumor to a distant part of the body. But some metastatic cancers are not advanced. For example, some instances of metastatic testicular cancer are curable, according to the American Cancer Society
.
Some doctors may use these words interchangeably, so it�s important to ask what they mean by �advanced� or �metastatic� cancer.

neoplasm metastasis,"for neoplasm metastasis, what types of cancer are more likely to metastasize??","All cancers can metastasize, and metastasis is a key cause
of death from cancer. Together, these cancers are responsible for almost 50%
of all cancer deaths:
lung and bronchus
colon and rectal
pancreatic
breast"
neoplasm metastasis,"for neoplasm metastasis, where do metastatic cancers commonly spread to, and what are the symptoms??","Cancer can spread almost anywhere, but different types of cancer tend to spread to certain places. The following are the most common
sites of metastasis, according to the National Cancer Institute:
Metastatic cancer type Main sites of metastasis
bladder bone, liver, lung
breast bone, brain, liver, lung
colon liver, lung, peritoneum (the membrane that lines your abdominal cavity)
kidney adrenal gland, bone, brain, liver, lung
lung adrenal gland, bone, brain, liver, the other lung
melanoma bone, brain, liver, lung, skin, muscle
ovarian liver, lung, peritoneum
pancreatic liver, lung, peritoneum
prostate adrenal gland, bone, liver, lung
rectal liver, lung, peritoneum
stomach liver, lung, peritoneum
thyroid bone, liver, lung
uterine bone, liver, lung, peritoneum, vagina
General symptoms of metastasis
Fatigue and weight loss are among the general symptoms of metastatic cancer. Other symptoms depend on the site of metastasis, such as:
Bone: pain, easily fractured bones
Brain: headache, dizziness, vision problems, seizures
Lung: shortness of breath, cough, chest pain
Liver: jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), bloating, abdominal pain
The number and size of tumors can also affect the symptoms."
neoplasm metastasis,"for neoplasm metastasis, how are metastatic cancers diagnosed??","Diagnosing metastatic cancer may involve imaging tests such as:
X-ray
ultrasound
CT scan
MRI scan
PET scan
bone scan
A biopsy of a tumor can help identify the type of cancer."
neoplasm metastasis,"for neoplasm metastasis, how are metastatic cancers treated??","Cancer is harder to treat once it spreads beyond the original site. Because every type of metastatic cancer is different, treatment options vary.
The main treatments are based on the specific type of cancer, which refers to where the cancer started, not where it has spread to. For example, colon cancer that spreads to the liver is treated as colon cancer, not liver cancer.
Other factors that affect treatment options are:
site or sites of metastasis
previous cancer treatments, if any
age and overall health
Treatment may include one or more of the following:
surgery
chemotherapy
radiation therapy
targeted therapies
immunotherapy
hormonal therapy
palliative care
In some cases, the goal of treatment may be to cure the cancer or slow it down. In others, you may want to focus on symptom relief and quality of life. You can always receive palliative care along with other treatments.
Doctors will help determine the best treatment plan based on the specifics of your situation and your preferences."
neoplasm metastasis,"for neoplasm metastasis, what�s the outlook for people with metastatic cancer??","The outlook depends on many things, including the specific type of cancer. For example, research from 2017 looked at survival after bone metastasis by primary cancer type.
Follow-ups at 1 and 5 years suggest that people with bone metastasis from breast cancer have a better outlook than people with bone metastasis from lung cancer.
Other factors that can influence survival rates are:
site or sites of metastasis
your body�s response to specific treatments
your age and general health
Survival rates vary for different types of cancer. The following are the 5-year relative survival rates for several types of cancer that were metastatic at diagnosis:
Metastatic cancer type 5-year relative survival rate
prostate 32.3%
breast 30.0%
colorectal 15.1%
lung and bronchus 7.0%
pancreatic 3.1%
These statistics represent people who received a diagnosis from 2012 to 2018. They don�t include people who received a diagnosis or treatment after 2018 and may not reflect the latest treatments.
Keep in mind that these are general statistics and your doctor will be able to offer a more personal outlook."
neoplasm metastasis,"for neoplasm metastasis, takeaway?","Metastatic cancer is cancer that has spread from its primary site to a distant part of the body. For many types of cancer, �metastatic� refers to stage 4 cancer. Metastatic cancer is often treatable, though it�s challenging.
Most metastatic cancers are not curable, but it�s possible to live for many years with metastatic cancer if the disease is well managed.
Survival rates are general statistics based on people who received a diagnosis at least 5 years ago. Because there are so many variables, your outlook may be quite different. That�s why it�s best to discuss your outlook with your doctor."

Could you provide information on malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon?,"Colon cancer occurs when cells in your large intestine and rectum grow out of control. Treatment can vary by the stage and type of colon cancer.
Colon cancer is a type of cancer that starts in your colon (large intestine) or rectum. Your colon and rectum are the organs that make up the lower portion of your digestive system.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
, colon cancer � also known as colorectal cancer � is the third most common type of cancer in the United States when certain common skin cancers are excluded. In fact, the American Cancer Society (ACS)
estimates that about 1 in 23 men and 1 in 25 women will develop colorectal cancer during their lifetime.
The symptoms, treatment, and outlook for colon cancer will generally depend on the stage your cancer is in when you�re first diagnosed.

malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon,"for malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon, stages of colon cancer?","Doctors use staging as a general guideline to figure out how far along the cancer is. It�s important for a doctor to know the stage of the cancer because it helps determine the best treatment plan for you. It�s also a good way to estimate your long-term outlook.
Stage 0 colon cancer is the earliest stage, and stage 4 is the most advanced stage. Here�s how the stages are defined:
Stage 0. Also known as carcinoma in situ, in this stage abnormal cells are only in the inner lining of the colon or rectum.
Stage 1. The cancer has penetrated the lining, or mucosa, of the colon or rectum and may have grown into the muscle layer. It hasn�t spread to nearby lymph nodes or to other parts of the body.
Stage 2. The cancer has spread to the walls of the colon or rectum, or through the walls to nearby tissues, but hasn�t affected the lymph nodes.
Stage 3. The cancer has moved to the lymph nodes but not to other parts of the body.
Stage 4. The cancer has spread to other distant organs, such as the liver or lungs."
malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon,"for malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon, what are the symptoms of colon cancer??","You might not experience colon cancer symptoms at all, especially in the early stages. If you do experience symptoms in stages 0 through 2, they�ll often include:
constipation
diarrhea
changes in stool color
changes in stool shape, such as narrowed stool
blood in the stool
bleeding from the rectum
excessive gas
abdominal cramps
abdominal pain
Many of these symptoms can also be caused by other, less serious, conditions. However, it�s a good idea to see a doctor if you�ve had any of these symptoms for longer than a week or two. You and your doctor can talk about your symptoms and decide if colon cancer screening is appropriate.
Stage 3 or 4 symptoms (late-stage symptoms)
Colon cancer symptoms are more noticeable in stages 3 and 4. In addition to the above symptoms, you might also experience:
excessive fatigue
unexplained weakness
unintentional weight loss
changes in your stool that last longer than a month
a feeling that your bowels won�t completely empty

malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon,"for malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon, are there different types of colon cancer??","It might surprise you to learn that there is more than one type of colon cancer. There are different types of cells that turn cancerous and there are cells in different parts of the digestive tract that can lead to colon cancer.
The most common type of colon cancer starts from adenocarcinomas. Adenocarcinomas form within the cells that make mucus in either the colon or rectum. According to the ACS
, adenocarcinomas make up most colon cancer cases.
Less commonly, colon cancers are caused by other types of tumors, such as:
lymphomas, which can form in lymph nodes or in the colon first
carcinoids, which start in hormone-making cells within your intestines
sarcomas, which form in soft tissues such as muscles in the colon
gastrointestinal stromal tumors, which can start off as benign and then become cancerous (They usually form in the digestive tract, but rarely in the colon.)"
malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon,"for malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon, what causes colon cancer??","Researchers are still studying the causes of colon cancer.
Cancer may be caused by genetic mutations that can either be inherited or acquired. These mutations don�t guarantee you�ll develop colon cancer, but they do increase your chances.
Some mutations may cause abnormal cells to accumulate in the lining of the colon, forming polyps. These are small, benign growths. However, untreated polyps can become cancerous. Removing these growths through surgery can be a preventive measure."
malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon,"for malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon, what are the risk factors for colon cancer??","There are some risk factors that can increase your chances of developing colon cancer. Having one of these risk factors doesn�t automatically mean you�ll get colon cancer, but it does make it more likely than if you had no risk factors.
Risk factors you can�t change
Some factors that increase your risk of developing colon cancer can�t be changed. For instance, your age, ethnicity, and family health history can all impact your risk of colon cancer.
Risk factors you can�t control include:
being over 50
a prior history of colon polyps
a prior history of bowel diseases
a family history of colorectal cancer
having certain genetic syndromes, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)
being of African or Ashkenazi Jewish descent
Risk factors you can avoid
Other risk factors are avoidable. This means you can change them to decrease your risk of developing colon cancer. Avoidable risk factors include:
being overweight or having obesity
being a smoker
being a heavy drinker
having type 2 diabetes
having a sedentary lifestyle
consuming a diet high in processed meats"
malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon,"for malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon, how is colon cancer diagnosed??","An early diagnosis of colon cancer gives you the best chance of curing it. Since colon cancer often has no symptoms during the early stages, it is often caught during routine screenings.
The US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) and the ACS
now recommend colon cancer screening starting at 45, in light of younger people getting diagnosed with colon cancer.
The American College of Gastroenterology recommends that people start colon cancer screening at 40 years old.
Your doctor will start by getting information about your medical and family history. They�ll also perform a physical exam. They may press on your abdomen or perform a rectal exam to determine whether lumps or polyps are present.
Fecal testing
The ACS
recommends yearly fecal testing. Fecal tests are used to detect hidden blood in your stool. There are two main types, the guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) and the fecal immunochemical test (FIT).
Guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT)
Guaiac is a plant-based substance used to coat a special card that your stool sample is placed upon. If any blood is present in your stool, the card will change color.
You�ll have to avoid certain foods and medications, such as red meat and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), before this test. They may interfere with your test results.
Fecal immunochemical test (FIT)
The FIT detects hemoglobin, a protein found in the blood. It�s considered more precise than the guaiac-based test.
That�s because the FIT is unlikely to detect bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract (a type of bleeding that is rarely caused by colorectal cancer). Additionally, the results of this test aren�t affected by foods and medications.
At-home tests
Because multiple stool samples are needed for these tests, your doctor will likely provide you with test kits to use at home.
You can also buy at-home test kits from companies such as LetsGetChecked and Everlywell.
These kits often require you to send a stool sample off to a lab for evaluation. Your test results should be available online within 5 business days. Afterward, you�ll have the option to consult with a medical care team about your test results.
The Second Generation FIT can also be purchased online, but the stool sample doesn�t have to be sent to a lab. Test results are available within 5 minutes. This test is accurate, FDA-approved, and able to detect additional conditions such as colitis. However, there�s no medical care team to consult with if you have questions about your results.
Blood tests
Your doctor may run blood tests to get a better idea of what�s causing your symptoms. Liver function tests and complete blood counts can rule out other diseases and disorders.
Sigmoidoscopy
Minimally invasive, sigmoidoscopy allows your doctor to examine your sigmoid colon, the last section of your colon, for abnormalities. The procedure, also known as flexible sigmoidoscopy, involves a flexible tube with a light on it.
The USPSTF recommends a flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, or every 10 years along with a yearly FIT test.
The ACS
recommends a flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years.
Colonoscopy
A colonoscopy involves the use of a long tube with a small camera attached. This procedure allows your doctor to see inside your colon and rectum to check for anything unusual. It�s usually performed after less invasive screening tests indicate that you might have colon cancer.
During a colonoscopy, your doctor can also remove tissue from abnormal areas. These tissue samples can then be sent to a laboratory for analysis.
Out of the existing diagnostic methods, sigmoidoscopies and colonoscopies are the most effective at detecting benign growths that may develop into colon cancer.
The USPSTF and the ACS
recommend a colonoscopy every 10 years.
X-ray
Your doctor may order an X-ray using a contrast solution that contains the chemical element barium.
Your doctor inserts this liquid into your bowels through the use of a barium enema. Once in place, the barium solution coats the lining of the colon. This helps improve the quality of the X-ray images.
CT scan
CT scans provide your doctor with a detailed image of your colon. A CT scan that�s used to diagnose colon cancer is sometimes called a virtual colonoscopy.

malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon,"for malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon, what are the treatment options for colon cancer??","Treatment of colon cancer depends on a variety of factors. A doctor will determine the best treatment plan for you based on your overall health and the stage of your colon cancer.
Surgery
In the earliest stages of colon cancer, it�s often possible for your surgeon to remove cancerous polyps through surgery. If the polyp hasn�t attached to the wall of the bowels, you�ll likely have an excellent outlook.
Your surgeon may need to remove a portion of the colon or rectum and the neighboring lymph nodes If your cancer has spread into your bowel walls. Your surgeon might be able to reattach the remaining healthy portion of the colon to the rectum. If this isn�t possible, they may perform a colostomy. This involves creating an opening in the abdominal wall for the removal of waste. A colostomy may be temporary or permanent.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy involves the use of drugs to kill cancer cells. For people with colon cancer, chemotherapy commonly takes place after surgery and is used to destroy lingering cancerous cells. Chemotherapy also controls the growth of tumors.
Chemotherapy drugs used to treat colon cancer include:
capecitabine (Xeloda)
fluorouracil
oxaliplatin (Eloxatin)
irinotecan (Camptosar)
Chemotherapy often comes with side effects that need to be controlled with additional medication.
Radiation
Radiation uses a powerful beam of energy, similar to that used in X-rays, to target and destroy cancerous cells before and after surgery. Radiation therapy commonly occurs alongside chemotherapy.
Other medications
Targeted therapies and immunotherapies may also be recommended. Drugs that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat colon cancer include:
bevacizumab (Avastin)
ramucirumab (Cyramza)
ziv-aflibercept (Zaltrap)
cetuximab (Erbitux)
panitumumab (Vectibix)
regorafenib (Stivarga)
pembrolizumab (Keytruda)
nivolumab (Opdivo)
ipilimumab (Yervoy)
They can treat metastatic, or late-stage, colon cancer that doesn�t respond to other types of treatment and has spread to other parts of the body."

ketoacidosis diabetic,what is ketoacidosis diabetic? Tell me about ketoacidosis diabetic? What kind of disease is ketoacidosis diabetic? Can you elaborate on ketoacidosis diabetic? What can you tell me about ketoacidosis diabetic? Could you describe what ketoacidosis diabetic is? I�d like to know more about ketoacidosis diabetic. Can you help? What information do you have on ketoacidosis diabetic? Could you provide information on ketoacidosis diabetic?,Diabetic ketoacidosis occurs when a person with diabetes type 1 or 2 has dangerously high levels of ketones in the body. It can be a medical emergency.
ketoacidosis diabetic,"for ketoacidosis diabetic, what is diabetic ketoacidosis??","Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of type 1 diabetes and, much less commonly, of type 2 diabetes. DKA happens when your blood sugar is very high and acidic substances called ketones build up to dangerous levels in your body.
Ketoacidosis shouldn�t be confused with ketosis, which is harmless. Ketosis can occur as a result of an extremely low carbohydrate diet, known as a ketogenic diet, or from fasting.
DKA only happens when you don�t have enough insulin in your body to process blood sugar into energy. If this happens, your liver starts to process fat into energy, which releases ketones into the blood. High levels of ketones in the blood are dangerous.
It�s less common in people with type 2 diabetes because insulin levels don�t usually drop so low, but it can happen. DKA may be the first sign of type 1 diabetes, as people with this disease can�t make their own insulin."
ketoacidosis diabetic,"for ketoacidosis diabetic, what are the symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis??","Symptoms of DKA can appear quickly.
Early symptoms of DKA can include:
frequent urination
extreme thirst or dry mouth
high blood sugar levels, also known as hyperglycemia
high levels of ketones in the urine
As DKA progresses, more symptoms may appear:
nausea or vomiting
abdominal pain
confusion
fruity-smelling breath
flushed face
fatigue or weakness
rapid breathing
dry skin
loss of consciousness, also known as fainting or syncope
DKA is a medical emergency. Call your local emergency services immediately if you think you may be experiencing DKA.
If left untreated, DKA can lead to a coma or death. If you use insulin, make sure you discuss the risk of DKA with your healthcare team and have a plan in place.
If you have type 1 diabetes and have a blood sugar reading of over 240 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), you should test yourself for ketones using a urine or blood test.
You should also test if you are sick or planning on exercising and your blood sugar is 240 mg/dL or higher.
Call your doctor if moderate or high levels of ketones are present. Always seek medical help if you suspect you are progressing to DKA.
People with type 2 diabetes are usually at lower risk of DKA. But the risk can increase when your body is under strain due to injury, infection, or surgery.
When to get emergency help
If you have any of the following symptoms, and you can�t reach your doctor, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
recommends getting emergency help right away:
a blood sugar level that stays at 300 mg/dL or higher
breath that smells fruity
severe vomiting, where you can�t keep food or drinks down
difficulty breathing
multiple symptoms of DKA
Get help by calling local emergency services or having someone take you to the nearest emergency room.
Was this helpful?"
ketoacidosis diabetic,"for ketoacidosis diabetic, how is diabetic ketoacidosis treated??","The treatment for DKA usually involves a combination of approaches to normalize blood sugar and insulin levels.
If you receive a diagnosis of DKA but haven�t yet received a diagnosis of diabetes, your doctor will create a diabetes treatment plan to keep ketoacidosis from recurring.
Infection can increase the risk of DKA. If your DKA is a result of an infection or illness, your doctor will treat that as well, usually with antibiotics.
Fluid replacement
At the hospital, your physician will likely give you intravenous (IV) fluids to help your body rehydrate. During a DKA event, you usually lose a lot of fluids, which can reduce the amount of blood flowing through your body.
Fluid replacement helps restore typical blood flow. It also helps treat dehydration, which can cause even higher blood sugar levels.
Electrolyte replacement
When your insulin levels are too low, your body�s electrolytes can also become atypically low.
Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that help your body, including the heart and nerves, function properly. Electrolyte replacement is also commonly done through an IV.
Insulin therapy
Insulin will likely be administered to you through an IV until your blood sugar level falls below 200 to 250 mg/dL
. The emergency care team will also monitor several other blood test results that indicate when insulin therapy is no longer needed.
When your blood sugar and other test readings are within an acceptable range, your doctor will work with you to help you avoid DKA in the future."
ketoacidosis diabetic,"for ketoacidosis diabetic, what causes diabetic ketoacidosis??","DKA occurs when insulin levels are low. Our bodies need insulin to use the available glucose in the blood. In DKA, glucose can�t get into the cells, so it builds up, resulting in high blood sugar levels.
In response, the body starts breaking down fat into a useable fuel that doesn�t require insulin. Turning fat into energy produces ketones. When too many ketones build up, your blood becomes acidic. This is diabetic ketoacidosis.
The most common causes of DKA are:
missing an insulin injection or not injecting enough insulin
illness or infection
a clog in your insulin pump, if you use one"
ketoacidosis diabetic,"for ketoacidosis diabetic, who is at risk for developing diabetic ketoacidosis??","Risk factors for DKA include:
having type 1 diabetes
being a younger age, as research suggests 63 percent of DKA cases happen in people below the age of 51
physiologic shock, a life threatening condition caused by interrupted blood flow
emotional or psychological stress
acute cardiovascular disease, such as heart attack or stroke
acute gastrointestical illness, such as pancreatitis
having an alcohol use or drug use disorder
having an eating disorder
certain endocrine conditions, such as Cushing syndrome and hyperthyroidism
recent surgery
pregnancy
Medications
Certain medications can increase the risk of DKA. These include:
some antipsychotic medications, such as clozapine (Clozaril), olanzapine (Zyprexa), and risperidone (Risperdal)
corticosteroids
thiazide diuretics
Ketosis-prone diabetes
Although DKA is less common in people who have type 2 diabetes, it does occur. Some people with type 2 diabetes are considered �ketosis-prone� and are at a higher risk of DKA. A diagnosis of ketosis-prone diabetes is more likely
for:
Black (African American, Afro Caribbean, and sub-Saharan African), Asian (Chinese, Indian, and Japanese), and Hispanic people
people who have overweight or obesity
people who are middle-aged
males
It�s best to talk with your doctor about your risk factors to make sure you have the right treatment plan in place."
ketoacidosis diabetic,"for ketoacidosis diabetic, testing for ketones?","Testing for ketones is one of the first steps for diagnosing DKA. If you have type 1 diabetes, you should have a supply of home ketone tests. These test either your urine or your blood for the presence of ketones.
You can buy these in drug stores or online.
When to test
According to the American Diabetes Association, you should test for ketones:
if your blood glucose level is 240 mg/dL or higher
if you are sick
if you have any symptoms of DKA
Test your urine or blood every 4 to 6 hours.
How to test
Urine test strips change color to signal the presence of ketones in your urine. You�ll need to pee on the strip or dip the strip into the pee you�ve collected in a container. The indicator on the strip will change color. Compare the test strip to the results chart.
Blood ketone testers are also available. These are usually combination devices that can measure both glucose levels and ketone levels.
Similar to blood glucose testing, you�ll need to apply a small sample of blood to a test strip. The test strip is inserted into a monitor device to test for the presence of ketones in your blood.
A doctor or pharmacist can advise you on when and how to use your home ketone tests."
ketoacidosis diabetic,"for ketoacidosis diabetic, how is diabetic ketoacidosis diagnosed??","A doctor will likely do a test to confirm the presence of ketones in your urine. They will usually also test your blood sugar level. Other tests your doctor may order include:
basic bloodwork, including potassium and sodium, to assess metabolic function
arterial blood gas, where blood is drawn from an artery to determine its acidity
blood pressure
electrocardiogram (ECG)
chest X-ray or other tests to look for signs of an infection, such as pneumonia"
ketoacidosis diabetic,"for ketoacidosis diabetic, preventing diabetic ketoacidosis?","There are many ways to prevent DKA. Prevention means following your diabetes treatment plan carefully and taking some extra care when you�re sick.
Follow your treatment plan
You can lower your risk of DKA with proper management of your diabetes:
Take your medications as directed, even if you�re feeling fine.
Follow your meal plan.
Test your blood sugar consistently, as recommended by your doctor. This will help you get in the habit of making sure your numbers are in range. If you notice a problem, you can talk with your doctor about adjusting your treatment plan.
Talk with your doctor about adjusting your insulin dosage levels based on your activity level, illnesses, or other factors, such as what you�re eating.
If you have high blood sugar and your blood or urine test detects ketones, do not exercise. Exercising with high blood sugar can be dangerous when you have diabetes. It�s best to talk with your doctor about how to manage this situation.
Sometimes the cost of insulin can make it more difficult
to follow a diabetes treatment plan. Read more about how to access insulin at a reduced cost.
When you�re sick
Although you can�t completely avoid illness or infection, you can take steps to help you remember to take your insulin and to help prevent and plan for a DKA emergency.
A �sick day plan� can reduce the risk of DKA:
Test for ketone levels when you�re sick. This can help you catch mild to moderate ketone levels before they threaten your health.
Set an alarm if you take your medication at the same time every day, or use a reminder tool like a phone app.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist if it�s okay to prefill your syringe or syringes in the morning. That will help you easily see if you missed a dose.
Take the medications advised by your healthcare team to treat fever or infection.
Have soft or liquid foods available that are easier to eat if you become nauseous.
If there�s someone helping to care for you when you�re sick at home, make sure they have information about your diabetes treatment plan, including your medication and testing schedules.
Call your doctor if you detect moderate or high ketones in a home test. If you can�t reach your doctor and you suspect you may be progressing to DKA, get emergency help. Early detection is essential."

Could you provide information on tonic-clonic epilepsy or tonic-clonic seizures?,"Tonic seizures cause sudden stiffness and rigidity in your muscles. They typically last less than 1 minute.
Seizures are rapid bursts of electrical activity in your brain that can cause involuntary movement and a loss of awareness or consciousness. There are different classifications of seizures. These depend on factors like the part of your brain that�s affected and the symptoms the seizure causes.
Tonic seizures are characterized by sudden muscle stiffness in your limbs or torso. They can occur when you�re awake or asleep and usually last less than a minute
.
Anyone can have a seizure, but most people with recurrent seizures have a neurological condition known as epilepsy. Epilepsy exists on a spectrum. This means the type, frequency, and severity of seizures varies considerably between individuals.
About 11%
of people in the United States experience a seizure in their lifetime.
Read on to learn more about tonic seizures, including what causes them and how they differ from other types of seizures."
tonic-clonic epilepsy or tonic-clonic seizures,"for tonic-clonic epilepsy or tonic-clonic seizures, what are tonic seizures??","Your nervous system (which includes your brain) uses electrical impulses to send and receive messages throughout your body. Seizures are abnormal bursts of electrical activity that interfere with this system, causing disruptions that can lead to many different symptoms.
Tonic seizures cause sudden, temporary stiffness in your limbs and trunk. The name �tonic� comes from �muscle tone.� Your muscle tone is the stiffness of your muscles at rest.
During a tonic seizure, your muscles become stiff and rigid. If you�re standing, you may fall to the floor. These seizures are often brief and tend to occur during sleep.
Tonic seizures can be focal or generalized.
Focal seizures: These are caused by abnormal electrical activity that starts in one region of your brain.
Generalized seizures: These are caused by abnormal electrical activity in both sides of your brain.
Focal tonic seizures: These cause symptoms in one part of your body.
Generalized tonic seizures: These cause symptoms throughout your body.
Focal tonic seizures can spread and become generalized. When this happens, they�re called focal to bilateral tonic seizures."
tonic-clonic epilepsy or tonic-clonic seizures,"for tonic-clonic epilepsy or tonic-clonic seizures, tonic vs. tonic-clonic seizure?","Tonic-clonic seizures used to be called grand mal seizures. They�re the type of seizure many people think of when they think of epilepsy. A tonic-clonic seizure shares features of both tonic and clonic seizures.
Tonic-clonic seizures start with the tonic phase, where your muscles suddenly stiffen and twitch. It then enters the clonic stage, where you might lose consciousness or awareness of your surroundings.
Symptoms of seizures Tonic Clonic Tonic-clonic
Muscle stiffness yes no yes
Muscle twitching and jerking no yes yes
Awareness normal or slightly altered consciousness normal or slightly altered consciousness loss of consciousness"
tonic-clonic epilepsy or tonic-clonic seizures,"for tonic-clonic epilepsy or tonic-clonic seizures, what does a tonic seizure look like??","If you witness someone having a tonic seizure, you may notice their arms or legs become stiff as a board. Their upper body may also straighten and become rigid. If they�re standing, they may fall to the floor and continue to appear stiff in one or more areas of their body.
Tonic seizures are generally brief. In a 2023 study
, researchers found that 95% of generalized tonic seizures lasted 3 to 36 seconds. They also found that 95% of focal tonic seizures lasted 2 to 148 seconds.
Half of generalized tonic seizures lasted less than 8.5 seconds and half of focal tonic seizures lasted less than 16.5 seconds.
How to help someone having a tonic seizure
Most seizures don�t require emergency medical attention. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
, the best way to help somebody having any type of seizure is:
Stay with them until they�re fully awake.
Comfort them and speak calmly.
Check to see if they have a medical bracelet with emergency information.
Keep yourself and other people around you calm.
Help them sit in a safe place when the seizure is over and explain what happened.
Offer to help the person get home.

tonic-clonic epilepsy or tonic-clonic seizures,"for tonic-clonic epilepsy or tonic-clonic seizures, what causes tonic seizures??","Like other types of seizures, tonic seizures are caused by abnormal surges of electrical information in your brain. There are many potential causes of seizures. Focal tonic seizures are associated with the activation of a part of your brain called Brodmann area 6
.
Tonic seizures are often seen
in people who experienced hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy around birth. Hypoxic ischemic brain injuries happen because of a lack of oxygen in your brain.
It can also happen in people with intraventricular hemorrhage. Intraventricular hemorrhage is bleeding in the spaces that allow fluid to flow out of your brain.
According to the Epilepsy Foundation, tonic seizures are common among people who have Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and other types of epilepsy.
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a severe type of epilepsy that usually develops before 4 years of age
. It can be caused by:
brain malfunctions
tuberous sclerosis
lack of oxygen around birth (perinatal asphyxia)

tonic-clonic epilepsy or tonic-clonic seizures,"for tonic-clonic epilepsy or tonic-clonic seizures, how are seizure disorders diagnosed??","Seizure disorders are usually diagnosed by a type of specialist called a neurologist.
Bring a written description of what happens during your seizures. Or have someone take a video and bring that along for the doctor to review. This is an important part of the diagnosis process. A neurologist can use this information to narrow down which type of seizure you�re having.
A neurologist can run various tests to help find the underlying cause of your seizures. They�ll likely give you a test called an electroencephalogram (EEG). This test uses special sensors placed on your head to detect any unusual electrical activity in your brain.
A doctor may also recommend a brain scan to look for brain tumors or structural abnormalities in your brain.
Blood tests can help a doctor rule out genetic conditions or signs of infection."

respiratory failure,what is respiratory failure? Tell me about respiratory failure? What kind of disease is respiratory failure? Can you elaborate on respiratory failure? What can you tell me about respiratory failure? Could you describe what respiratory failure is? I�d like to know more about respiratory failure. Can you help? What information do you have on respiratory failure? Could you provide information on respiratory failure?,"Signs of acute respiratory failure include dizziness, shortness of breath, and a bluish discoloration of your extremities. It can be life threatening and requires immediate medical care."
respiratory failure,"for respiratory failure, what is acute respiratory failure??","Acute respiratory failure occurs
when your lungs cannot release enough oxygen into your blood, which prevents your organs from properly functioning. It also occurs if your lungs cannot remove carbon dioxide from your blood.
Respiratory failure happens when the capillaries, or tiny blood vessels surrounding your air sacs, cannot properly exchange carbon dioxide and/or oxygen.
There are two types of respiratory failure: acute and chronic.
Acute respiratory failure happens suddenly. It occurs due to a disease or injury that interferes with the ability of the lungs to deliver oxygen or remove carbon dioxide. In most cases, acute respiratory failure can be fatal
if not treated quickly.
Chronic respiratory failure has multiple causes. It can occur when the airways narrow or become damaged over time. It can also occur with conditions that cause the respiratory muscles to weaken over time. Some causes of chronic respiratory failure include:
damaged and/or narrow airways, which can occur in conditions like:
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
bronchiectasis
asthma
cystic fibrosis
lung fibrosis, which can occur in conditions like:
pneumonia
interstitial lung disease
respiratory muscle weakness, which can occur with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)"
respiratory failure,"for respiratory failure, types of acute respiratory failure?","There are two types of acute and chronic respiratory failure: hypoxemic and hypercapnic. Both conditions can trigger serious complications, and they often occur together.
Hypoxemic respiratory failure, or hypoxemia, occurs when you do not have enough oxygen in your blood.
Hypercapnic respiratory failure, or hypercapnia, happens when there is too much carbon dioxide in your blood."
respiratory failure,"for respiratory failure, what are the symptoms of acute respiratory failure??","The symptoms of acute respiratory failure depend on its underlying cause. Symptoms can also differ by the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood.
People with low oxygen may experience
:
shortness of breath
a bluish coloration on lips, fingertips, or toes
drowsiness
difficulty performing routine activities, such as dressing or climbing stairs, due to extreme tiredness
People with high carbon dioxide levels may experience:
rapid breathing
confusion
blurred vision
headaches"
respiratory failure,"for respiratory failure, what causes acute respiratory failure??","Acute respiratory failure has several causes:
Obstruction
When something lodges in your throat, you may have trouble getting enough oxygen into your lungs. Obstruction can also occur in people with COPD or asthma when an exacerbation causes the airways to narrow.
Injury
An injury that impairs or compromises your respiratory system can negatively affect the amount of oxygen or carbon dioxide in your blood.
For instance, a spinal cord or brain injury can immediately affect your breathing. If the brain cannot relay messages to the lungs, the lungs may not function properly.
Rib or chest injuries can also affect your breathing.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a serious condition that causes fluid to build up in your lungs. It results in low oxygen in the blood. People who develop ARDS typically have an underlying health condition, such as:
pneumonia
pancreatitis
sepsis
trauma to the head or chest
blood transfusions
near drowning
lung injuries related to inhaling smoke or chemical products
Drug or alcohol use
Experiencing a drug overdose or drinking too much alcohol can also impair brain function and hinder breathing.
Chemical inhalation
Inhaling toxic chemicals, smoke, or fumes can cause acute respiratory failure. These chemicals may injure or damage lung tissue, including the air sacs and capillaries.
Stroke
A stroke happens when something disrupts blood flow to the brain. Strokes often affect only one side of the brain.
Although strokes present with some warning signs, such as slurred speech or confusion, they typically occur suddenly. If you have a stroke, you can lose the ability to breathe.
Infection
Infections can cause respiratory distress. Pneumonia, in particular, may cause respiratory failure, even without ARDS."
respiratory failure,"for respiratory failure, who is at risk for acute respiratory failure??","You may be at risk for acute respiratory failure if you:
smoke tobacco products
drink alcohol excessively
have a family history of respiratory disease or conditions
have an injury to the spine, brain, or chest
have a compromised immune system
have chronic respiratory conditions, such as lung cancer, COPD, or asthma"
respiratory failure,"for respiratory failure, diagnosing acute respiratory failure?","Acute respiratory failure requires immediate medical attention. You may require supplemental oxygen to help you breathe and prevent organ damage.
When you�re in stable condition, a doctor may diagnose you by:
performing a physical exam
asking questions about your personal or family health history
checking your body�s oxygen and carbon dioxide levels with a pulse oximetry device and an arterial blood gas test
ordering a chest X-ray of your lungs"
respiratory failure,"for respiratory failure, complications?","Because acute respiratory failure means your organs are not receiving the oxygen-rich blood they need to function, complications can involve multiple organ systems. Acute respiratory failure can often
be fatal.
Pulmonary complications, or those affecting the lungs, can include:
pulmonary embolism
pulmonary fibrosis
pneumonia
pneumothorax (collapsed lung)
Other complications can include:
gastrointestinal hemorrhage
renal (kidney) failure
hepatic (liver) failure"
respiratory failure,"for respiratory failure, treating acute respiratory failure?","Doctors must treat acute respiratory failure quickly, as it can be life threatening. Emergency medical treatment can help you breathe and prevent further organ damage.
Once you�re in stable condition, a doctor can treat any underlying conditions causing your respiratory failure.
Depending on any underlying conditions, a doctor can treat you in multiple ways, including the following scenarios:
If you�re in pain or having difficulty breathing, a doctor may prescribe pain medication or other medications to help you breathe better.
If you cannot breathe adequately, a doctor may insert a breathing tube into your mouth or nose and connect the tube to a ventilator to help you breathe.
If you can adequately breathe on your own and your hypoxemia (low blood oxygen) is mild, you may need supplemental oxygen from an oxygen tank to help you breathe better. This may include a portable air tank.
If you require prolonged ventilator support, you may need a tracheostomy. This operation creates an artificial airway in your windpipe."
respiratory failure,"for respiratory failure, what can i expect in the long term??","Acute respiratory failure can cause long-term damage to your lungs.
It may take several weeks
for your oxygen and carbon dioxide levels to reach a healthy range. You may also require pulmonary rehabilitation, which can include:
exercise therapy
education
counseling"
respiratory failure,"for respiratory failure, frequently asked questions?","The following include questions commonly asked about acute respiratory failure.
Can you recover from acute respiratory failure?
You can recover from acute respiratory failure, but immediate medical attention is essential. Your recovery treatment plan may include treatment for any physical trauma from the respiratory failure, the cause of the respiratory failure, and any procedures or medications you received while in the hospital.
Additionally, some people may experience post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) after a life threatening condition. PICS can include:
physical issues
cognitive issues
mental health issues
Is acute respiratory failure a cause of death?
Acute respiratory failure can result in death if you do not treat it quickly. If you experience any acute respiratory failure symptoms, seek immediate medical care.
How long does respiratory failure last?
Acute respiratory failure is a short-term medical condition. It happens suddenly and requires immediate treatment. Chronic respiratory failure is an ongoing condition."
respiratory failure,"for respiratory failure, takeaway?","Acute respiratory failure requires immediate medical attention and can be fatal.
Causes can include an injury or obstruction to your airway. Symptoms may include shortness of breath or dizziness. You may also experience severe drowsiness.

melanoma,what is melanoma? Tell me about melanoma? What kind of disease is melanoma? Can you elaborate on melanoma? What can you tell me about melanoma? Could you describe what melanoma is? I�d like to know more about melanoma. Can you help? What information do you have on melanoma? Could you provide information on melanoma?,"What is metastatic melanoma?
Melanoma is the rarest and most dangerous type of skin cancer. It begins in the melanocytes, which are the cells in your skin that produce melanin. Melanin is the pigment responsible for skin color.
Melanoma develops into growths on your skin, which often resemble moles. These growths or tumors may also come from existing moles. Melanomas can form on skin anywhere on your body, including inside the mouth or vagina.
Metastatic melanoma occurs when the cancer spreads from the tumor to other parts of your body. This is also known as stage 4 melanoma. Melanoma is the most likely of all skin cancers to become metastatic if not caught early.
The rates of melanoma have been increasing for the past 30 years. It�s estimated that 10,130 people
will die from melanoma in 2016."
melanoma,"for melanoma, what are the symptoms of metastatic melanoma??","Unusual moles may be the only indication of melanoma that hasn�t yet metastasized.
Moles caused by melanoma may have the following characteristics:
Asymmetry: Both sides of a healthy mole look very similar if you draw a line through it. Two halves of a mole or growth caused by melanoma look very different from each other.
Border: A healthy mole has smooth, even borders. Melanomas have jagged or uneven borders.
Color: A cancerous mole will have more than one color including:
brown
tan
black
red
white
blue
Size: Melanomas are more likely to be larger in diameter than benign moles. They usually grow to be larger than the eraser on a pencil
You should always have a doctor examine a mole that changes in size, shape, or color because it can be a sign of cancer.
Symptoms of metastatic melanoma depend on where the cancer has spread. These symptoms usually only appear once the cancer is already advanced.
If you have metastatic melanoma, you may experience symptoms such as:
hardened lumps under your skin
swollen or painful lymph nodes
difficulty breathing or a cough that doesn�t go away, if the cancer has spread to your lungs
enlarged liver or loss of appetite, if the cancer has spread to your liver or stomach
bone pain or broken bones, if the cancer has spread to the bone
weight loss
fatigue
headaches
seizures, if the cancer has spread to your brain
weakness or numbness in your arms or legs"
melanoma,"for melanoma, what are the causes and risk factors of metastatic melanoma??","Melanoma occurs due to a mutation in melanin-producing skin cells. Doctors currently believe that too much exposure to ultraviolet light either from sun exposure or tanning beds is the leading cause.
Metastatic melanoma occurs when the melanoma is not detected and treated early.
Risk factors
Several risk factors can contribute to developing melanoma. Those with a family history of melanoma have a higher risk than those who don�t. Approximately 10 percent
of people who develop melanoma have a family history of the disease. Other risk factors include:
fair or light skin
a large number of moles, especially irregular moles
frequent exposure to ultraviolet light
Those who are older are more likely to develop melanoma than younger individuals. In spite of this, melanoma is one of the most common cancers in people under 30, especially in young women. After the age of 50, men have a higher risk of developing melanoma.
The risk of melanomas becoming metastatic is higher in those who have:
primary melanomas, which are visible skin growths
melanomas that aren�t removed
a suppressed immune system"
melanoma,"for melanoma, how is metastatic melanoma diagnosed??","If you notice an unusual mole or growth, make an appointment to get it checked by a dermatologist. A dermatologist is a doctor who specializes in skin conditions.
Diagnosing melanoma
If your mole looks suspicious, your dermatologist will remove a small sample to check for skin cancer. If it comes back positive, they�ll likely remove the mole completely. This is called an excisional biopsy.
They�ll also evaluate the tumor based on its thickness. Generally, the thicker the tumor, the more serious the melanoma. This will affect their treatment plan.
Diagnosing metastatic melanoma
If melanoma is detected, your doctor will run tests to make sure the cancer hasn�t spread.
One of the first tests they may order is a sentinel node biopsy. This involves injecting dye into the area the melanoma was removed from. The dye moves to the nearby lymph nodes. These lymph nodes are then removed and screened for cancer cells. If they�re cancer free, it typically means the cancer hasn�t spread.
If the cancer is in your lymph nodes, your doctor will use other tests to see if the cancer has spread anywhere else in your body. These include:
X-rays
CT scans
MRI scans
PET scans
Blood tests"
melanoma,"for melanoma, how is metastatic melanoma treated??","Treatment for a melanoma growth will begin with excision surgery to remove the tumor and cancer cells around it. Surgery alone can treat melanoma that hasn�t spread yet.
Once the cancer has metastasized and spread, other treatments are required.
If the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, the affected areas may be removed through lymph node dissection. Doctors may also prescribe interferon after surgery to reduce the likelihood of the cancer spreading.
Your doctor may suggest radiation, immunotherapy, or chemotherapy to treat metastatic melanoma. Surgery may be used to remove cancer in other parts of your body.
Metastatic melanoma is often hard to treat. However, many clinical trials are underway that are looking for new ways to treat the condition.
Complications caused by treatment
The treatments for metastatic melanoma can cause nausea, pain, vomiting, and fatigue.
Removal of your lymph nodes can disrupt the lymphatic system. This can lead to fluid buildup and swelling in your limbs, called lymphedema.
Some people experience confusion or �mental cloudiness� during chemotherapy treatment. This is temporary. Others may experience peripheral neuropathy or damage to the nerves from the chemotherapy. This can be permanent."
melanoma,"for melanoma, what is the outlook for metastatic melanoma??","Melanoma is curable if caught and treated early. Once melanoma has become metastatic, it�s much harder to treat. The average five-year survival rate
for stage 4 metastatic melanoma is about 15 to 20 percent.
If you�ve had metastatic melanoma or melanomas in the past, it�s important to continue to get regular follow-ups with your doctor. Metastatic melanoma can recur, and can even come back in other parts of your body.
Early detection is essential to treating melanoma successfully before it becomes metastatic. Make an appointment with your dermatologist for annual skin cancer checks. You should also call them if you notice new or changing moles."

Early stage symptoms of lung cancer may include cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Lung cancer is a cancer that starts in the lungs, and can spread to other areas of the body.
Early symptoms of lung cancer can be subtle, but the sooner you are diagnosed, the better your treatment options and possible outcomes.
Lung cancer is primarily treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Newer treatments include immunotherapy and targeted therapy.
Read on to learn more about lung cancer, and the current and evolving treatment options."
malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung,"for malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung, what are the symptoms of lung cancer??","Early symptoms of lung cancer
The early stages of lung cancer don�t always cause symptoms. When early symptoms do occur, they can include signs such as shortness of breath, along with unexpected symptoms, such as back pain.
Back pain can occur when tumors cause pressure in your lungs or when they spread to your spinal cord and ribs.
Other early signs of lung cancer may include:
a lingering or worsening cough
coughing up phlegm or blood
chest pain that worsens when you breathe deeply, laugh, or cough
hoarseness
wheezing
weakness and fatigue
loss of appetite and weight loss
recurrent respiratory infections such as pneumonia or bronchitis
Late symptoms of lung cancer
Additional symptoms of lung cancer depend on where new tumors form. Not everyone with late-stage lung cancer will experience every symptom.
Late-stage symptoms might include:
lumps in the neck or collarbone
bone pain especially in the back, ribs, or hips
headaches
dizziness
balance issues
numbness in arms or legs
yellowing of skin and eyes (jaundice)
drooping of one eyelid and shrunken pupils
lack of perspiration on one side of the face
shoulder pain
swelling of the face and upper body
Additionally, lung cancer tumors can sometimes release a substance similar to hormones, leading to a wide variety of symptoms known as paraneoplastic syndrome. Symptoms include: :
muscle weakness
nausea and vomiting
high blood pressure
high blood sugar
confusion
seizures"
malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung,"for malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung, what causes lung cancer??","Anyone can get lung cancer, but 90 percent of lung cancer cases are the result of smoking.
Smoke damages your lung tissue from the first second you inhale it. Once lung cells are damaged, they begin to behave abnormally. This increases your risk for lung cancer.
Small-cell lung cancer is almost always associated with heavy smoking. When you stop smoking, your lungs may be able to heal, reducing your risk of lung cancer.
You can also increase your risk of lung cancer by breathing in hazardous substances such as:
radon
asbestos
arsenic
cadmium
chromium
nickel
some petroleum products
uranium
Exposure to radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer, according to the American Lung Association.
Research shows that inherited genetic mutations may make you more likely to develop lung cancer, especially if you smoke or are exposed to other carcinogens. Sometimes, there�s no obvious cause for lung cancer.
Learn more about what causes lung cancer �"
malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung,"for malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung, what are the different types of lung cancer??","There are several different types of lung cancer. Most types of lung cancer are either non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). However, some people have tumors that contain both kinds of cells.
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): NSCLC makes up about 80 to 85 percent of all cases. There are several types of NSCLC. Most types of NSCL respond well to treatment if caught in the early stages.
Squamous cell lung carcinoma: About 30 percent of all cases of NSCLC begin in cells that line the passages of the respiratory tract. This is called squamous cell carcinoma.
Adenocarcinomas: This type usually forms in the outer part of the lungs.
Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS): This rare subset of adenocarcinoma begins in the tiny air sacs in the lungs. It�s not aggressive and may not need immediate treatment.
Adenosquamous carcinoma: This cancer develops in a mixture of squamous cells and mucus-producing cells.
Large cell carcinoma: Large cell carcinoma is a fast-growing group of NSCLCs that can�t be classified under other cancer types.
Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC): About 15 to 20 percent of lung cancers are SCLC. This type of lung cancer is more aggressive than NSCLC. Although SCLC often initially responds better to chemotherapy, it is less likely to be cured than NSCLC.
Mesothelioma: This type of lung cancer is associated with asbestos exposure. It occurs when carcinoid tumors start in hormone-producing (neuroendocrine) cells. Mesothelioma is aggressive and fast-growing. It does not respond well to treatment.
Learn how lung cancer type can affect survival rates �"
malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung,"for malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung, risk factors for lung cancer?","There are multiple known risk factors for lung cancer. These include:
Smoking: Smoking is the single biggest risk factor for lung cancer. This includes cigarettes, cigars, and pipes. Tobacco products contain thousands of toxic substances. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
, cigarette smokers are 15 to 30 times more likely to get lung cancer than nonsmokers.
Secondhand smoke: Every year in the United States, about 7,300 people
who�ve never smoked die from lung cancer caused by secondhand smoke.
Exposure to radon: Breathing in radon is the leading cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers. It�s a good idea to test your home for levels of radon to reduce your risk.
Exposure to asbestos, diesel exhaust, and other toxic substances: Breathing in toxic substances can increase your risk, especially if you�re subject to repeat exposure.
A family history of lung cancer: Having family members with lung cancer increases your risk of lung cancer.
A personal history of lung cancer: You�re more likely to get lung cancer if you�ve had lung cancer in the past, especially if you�re a smoker.
Previous radiation therapy to the chest: Radiation therapy can increase your risk of lung cancer.

malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung,"for malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung, lung cancer and smoking?","Not all smokers get lung cancer, and not everyone who has lung cancer is a smoker. But there�s no doubt that smoking is the biggest risk factor. It�s responsible for 9 out of 10
lung cancers. Plus, you don�t have to be a smoker to be affected. Secondhand smoke also increases your risk of lung cancer.
In addition to cigarettes, cigar and pipe smoking are also linked to lung cancer. The more you smoke and the longer you smoke, the greater your chance of developing lung cancer.
Former smokers are still at risk of developing lung cancer, but quitting can lower that risk considerably. Within 10 years of quitting smoking, the risk of dying from lung cancer drops by half.
Learn more about the other causes of lung cancer �"
malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung,"for malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung, diagnosing lung cancer?","Diagnosing lung cancer starts with a conversation with your doctor and a physical exam. They�ll want to go over your health history and any symptoms you�re having. You�ll also need tests to confirm the diagnosis. These might include:
Imaging tests: An abnormal mass can be seen on X-ray, MRI, CT, and PET scans. These scans produce more detail and find smaller lesions.
Sputum cytology: If you produce phlegm when you cough, microscopic examination can determine if cancer cells are present.
Bronchoscopy: While under sedation, a lighted tube is passed down your throat and into your lungs, allowing closer examination of your lung tissue.
You might also have a biopsy. A biopsy is a procedure that involves obtaining a small sample of lung tissue which is then examined under a microscope. A biopsy can determine if tumor cells are cancerous. A biopsy may be performed using one of the the following methods:
Mediastinoscopy: In a mediastinoscopy, your doctor makes an incision at the base of the neck. A lighted instrument is inserted and surgical tools are used to take samples from lymph nodes. It�s usually performed in a hospital under general anesthesia.
Lung needle biopsy: With this procedure, your doctor inserts a needle through the chest wall and into the suspicious lung tissue. A needle biopsy can also be used to test lymph nodes. It�s usually performed in a hospital and you�ll be given a sedative to help you relax.
If the biopsy results are positive for cancer, you might need additional testing, such as a bone scan, to help determine if cancer has spread and to help with staging.

malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung,"for malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung, stages of lung cancer?","Cancer stages tell how far cancer has spread and help guide treatment.
The chance of successful or curative treatment is much higher when lung cancer is diagnosed and treated early. Because lung cancer may not cause obvious symptoms in the earlier stages, diagnosis often comes after it has spread.
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stages:
Stage 1: Cancer is found in the lung, but it has not spread outside the lung.
Stage 2: Cancer is found in the lung and nearby lymph nodes.
Stage 3: Cancer is in the lung and lymph nodes in the middle of the chest.
Stage 3A: Cancer is found in lymph nodes, but only on the same side of the chest where cancer first started growing.
Stage 3B: Cancer has spread to lymph nodes on the opposite side of the chest or to lymph nodes above the collarbone.
Stage 4: Cancer has spread to both lungs, into the area around the lungs, or to distant organs.
Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) stages:
There are two stages of SCLC, limited and extensive. In the limited stage, cancer is found in only one lung or nearby lymph nodes on the same side of the chest.
The extensive stage means cancer has spread:
throughout one lung
to the opposite lung
to lymph nodes on the opposite side
to fluid around the lung
to bone marrow
to distant organs
About 2 out of 3 people
with SCLC are already in the extensive stage when their cancer is diagnosed."
malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung,"for malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung, treatment for lung cancer?","The primary treatments for lung cancer include surgery to remove the tumor, and chemotherapy and radiation treatments to kill cancer cells. Sometimes, newer cancer treatments such as targeted therapy and immunotherapy are also used, but usually not until later stages.
As a rule, treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) varies from person to person. Your treatment plan will depend on specific details of your health and on the stage of your cancer when you were diagnosed.
Treatment options for NSCLC by stage typically include:
Stage 1 NSCLC: Surgery to remove a portion of the lung may be all you need. Chemotherapy may also be recommended, especially if you�re at high risk of recurrence. Cancer is most treatable if caught at this stage.
Stage 2 NSCLC: You may need surgery to remove part or all of your lung. Chemotherapy is usually recommended.
Stage 3 NSCLC: You may require a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation treatment.
Stage 4 NSCLC: Options include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.
Options for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) also include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. In most cases, the cancer will be too advanced for surgery.
If you�re diagnosed with lung cancer, your care will likely be managed by a team of doctors who may include:
a surgeon who specializes in the chest and lungs (thoracic surgeon)
a lung specialist (pulmonologist)
a medical oncologist
a radiation oncologist
Discuss all your treatment options before making a decision. Your doctors will coordinate care and keep each other informed. You may also want to discuss clinical trials with your doctor.
Clinical trials can provide access to promising new treatments and can be an option if your treatment plan has stalled.
Some people with advanced lung cancer choose not to continue treatment. You can still choose palliative care treatments, which are focused on treating the symptoms of cancer rather than the cancer itself.

Options may include:
Massage: Massage can help relieve pain and anxiety. Some massage therapists are trained to work with people with cancer.
Acupuncture: When performed by a trained practitioner, acupuncture may help ease pain, nausea, and vomiting. However, it�s not safe if you have low blood counts or take blood thinners.
Meditation: Relaxation and reflection can reduce stress and improve overall quality of life.
Yoga: Combining breathing techniques, meditation, and stretching, yoga can help you feel better overall and improve sleep.
Cannabis oil: Some people claim that cannabis oil use reduces pain, relieves nausea and vomiting, and improves appetite. However, more research is needed into these claims. Additionally, state laws on cannabis vary, so this option isn�t available nationwide."

Cancer treatments can cause you to lose your appetite. They can also make it hard for your body to absorb vitamins. If you�re deficient in certain nutrients, your doctor can advise you on foods or supplements if needed.
Here are a few dietary tips:
Eat whenever you have an appetite.
If you don�t have an appetite, try eating smaller meals throughout the day.
If you need to gain weight, supplement with low-sugar, high-calorie foods and drinks.
Use mint and ginger teas to soothe your digestive system.
If your stomach is easily upset or you have mouth sores, avoid spicy food.
If constipation is a problem, add more high-fiber foods.
As you progress through treatment, your tolerance to certain foods may change. So can your side effects and nutritional needs. It�s worth discussing nutrition with your doctor. You can also ask for a referral to a nutritionist or dietician.

The following are the estimated 5-year survival rates
for NSCLC by SEER
stage:
Localized: 60 percent
Regional: 33 percent
Distant: 6 percent

Could you provide information on manic disorder?,"Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition marked by large shifts in mood from mania to depression. Although bipolar disorder can be challenging to manage, many effective treatments and strategies are available.
Bipolar disorder isn�t a rare condition. In fact, the National Institute of Mental Health says that 2.8%
of U.S. adults � or about 5 million people � have a bipolar disorder diagnosis.
The condition used to be known as manic depression and bipolar disease.
Key symptoms of bipolar disorder include:
These episodes may last from a few days to several weeks or longer.
If you�re living with bipolar disorder, the following treatment options can help you learn to manage mood episodes, which can improve not only your symptoms but also your overall quality of life."
manic disorder,"for manic disorder, types of bipolar disorder?","There are three main types of bipolar disorder: bipolar I, bipolar II, and cyclothymia.
Bipolar I
Bipolar I is defined by the appearance of at least one manic episode. You may experience hypomanic episodes, which are less severe than manic episodes, or major depressive periods before and after the manic episode. A person can also go through a long period of stable mood before experiencing either mania or depression.
This type of bipolar disorder affects people of all sexes equally.
Are sex and gender the same thing?
People often use the terms sex and gender interchangeably, but they have different meanings:
�Sex� refers to the physical characteristics that differentiate male, female, and intersex bodies.
�Gender� refers to a person�s identity and how they feel inside. Examples include man, woman, nonbinary, agender, bigender, genderfluid, pangender, and trans. A person�s gender identity may differ from the sex they were assigned at birth.
Was this helpful?
Bipolar II
People with bipolar II experience one major depressive episode that lasts at least 2 weeks. They also have at least 1 hypomanic episode that lasts about 4 days. According to a 2017 review
, this type of bipolar disorder may be more common in females.
Cyclothymia
People with cyclothymia experience some symptoms of hypomania and depression, but not enough to characterize an episode of hypomania or depression.
These episodes also involve symptoms that are shorter and less severe than the episodes associated with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. Most people with this condition experience no mood symptoms for 1 to 2 months
at a time.
Your doctor can explain more about what kind of bipolar disorder you have when discussing your diagnosis.
Some people experience distinct mood symptoms that resemble but don�t align with these three types. If that�s the case for you, you might get a diagnosis of:
other specified bipolar and related disorders
unspecified bipolar and related disorders
Learn more about the types of bipolar disorder."
manic disorder,"for manic disorder, bipolar disorder symptoms?","To receive a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, you must experience at least one period of mania or hypomania.
These both involve feelings of excitement, impulsivity, and high energy, but hypomania is considered less severe than mania. Mania symptoms can affect your day-to-day life at work or home. Hypomania symptoms typically don�t cause as much disruption, but they can still be distressing.
Some people living with bipolar disorder also experience major depressive episodes or �down� moods.
These three main symptoms � mania, hypomania, and depression � are the main features of bipolar disorder. Different types of bipolar disorder involve different combinations of these symptoms.
Bipolar I symptoms
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5)
, a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder requires the following:
at least one episode of mania that lasts at least 1 week
symptoms that affect daily function
symptoms that don�t relate to another medical or mental health condition or substance use
You could also experience symptoms of psychosis or both mania and depression (known as mixed features). These symptoms can have more impact on your life. If you have them, it�s worth reaching out for professional support as soon as possible.
While you don�t need to experience episodes of hypomania or depression to receive a bipolar I diagnosis, many people with bipolar I do report these symptoms.
Bipolar II symptoms
A diagnosis of bipolar II requires:
at least one episode of hypomania that lasts 4 days or longer
and involves 3 or more symptoms of hypomania
hypomania-related changes in mood and usual function that others can notice, though these may not necessarily affect your daily life
at least one episode of major depression that lasts 2 weeks or longer
at least one episode of major depression involving five or more key depression symptoms that have a significant impact on your day-to-day life
symptoms that don�t relate to another medical or mental health condition or substance use
Bipolar II can also involve symptoms of psychosis, but only during an episode of depression. You could also experience mixed mood episodes, which means you�ll have symptoms of depression and hypomania simultaneously.
With bipolar II, though, you won�t experience mania. If you have a manic episode, you�ll receive a diagnosis of bipolar I.
Cyclothymia symptoms
A diagnosis of cyclothymia requires:
periods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depression symptoms, off and on, over 2 years or longer
(1 year
for children and adolescents)
symptoms that never meet the full criteria for an episode of hypomania or depression
symptoms that are present for at least half of the 2 years and never absent for longer than 2 months at a time
symptoms that don�t relate to another medical or mental health condition or substance use
symptoms that cause significant distress and affect daily life
Fluctuating mood symptoms characterize cyclothymia. These symptoms may be less severe than those of bipolar I or II. Still, they tend to last longer, so you�ll generally have less time when you experience no symptoms.
Hypomania may not have a big impact on your daily life. Depression, on the other hand, often leads to more serious distress and affects day-to-day function, even if your symptoms don�t qualify for a major depressive episode.
If you do experience enough symptoms to meet the criteria for a hypomanic or depressive episode, your diagnosis will likely change to another type of bipolar disorder or major depression, depending on your symptoms."
manic disorder,"for manic disorder, mania and hypomania?","An episode of mania often involves an emotional high. You might feel excited, impulsive, euphoric, and full of energy. You might also feel jumpy or notice your thoughts seem to race. Some people also experience hallucinations and other symptoms of psychosis.
Manic episodes can involve behavior that�s more impulsive than usual, often because you feel invincible or untouchable. Commonly cited examples of this kind of behavior include:
having sex without using a barrier method
misusing alcohol and drugs
going on spending sprees
But impulsiveness can also show up in plenty of other ways. Maybe you:
quit your job abruptly
take off on a road trip by yourself without telling anyone
make a big investment on a whim
drive much faster than usual, well above the speed limit
participate in extreme sports you wouldn�t ordinarily consider
While there are many reasons why a person might engage in these behaviors, the key to mania is that these are not things you would choose to engage in periods of stable mood.
Hypomania, generally associated with bipolar II disorder, involves many of the same symptoms, though they�re less severe. Unlike mania, hypomania often doesn�t lead
to consequences at work, school, or in your relationships. Episodes of hypomania don�t involve psychosis. They typically won�t last as long as episodes of mania or require inpatient care.
With hypomania, you might feel very productive and energized, but you may not notice other changes in your mood. People who don�t know you well may not, either. Those closest to you, however, will usually pick up on your shifting mood and energy levels."
manic disorder,"for manic disorder, major depressive episodes?","A �down� change in mood can leave you feeling lethargic, unmotivated, and sad.
Bipolar-related episodes of major depression will involve at least five of these symptoms:
a lasting low mood marked by deep sadness, hopelessness, or feelings of emptiness
loss of energy
a sense of feeling slower than usual or persistent restlessness
lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed
periods of too little or too much sleep
a sense of guilt or worthlessness
trouble concentrating, focusing, and making decisions
thoughts of death, dying, or suicide
changes in appetite or weight
Not everyone with bipolar disorder experiences
major depressive episodes, though many people do. Depending on your type of bipolar disorder, you might experience only a few symptoms of depression but not the full five needed for a major episode.
It�s also worth noting that sometimes, but not always, the euphoria of mania can feel enjoyable. Once you get treatment for mania, the symptom-free mood you experience might feel more like a �down� shift, or a period of depression, than a more typical mood state.
While bipolar disorder can cause a depressed mood, bipolar disorder and depression have one major difference. With bipolar disorder, you might have �up� and �down� mood states. With depression, though, your mood and emotions might remain
�down� until you get treatment.

manic disorder,"for manic disorder, bipolar disorder symptoms in women vs. men?","Most research suggests that males and females receive bipolar disorder diagnoses roughly equally
, though some studies suggest it may be more prevalent in females. However, the main symptoms of the disorder may vary, depending on the sex you were assigned at birth and your gender.
Females with bipolar disorder tend to receive diagnoses later in life, often in their 20s or 30s. Sometimes, they might first notice symptoms during pregnancy or after childbirth. They�re also more likely to be diagnosed with bipolar II than bipolar I.
Additionally, females living with bipolar disorder tend to experience:
milder episodes of mania
more depressive episodes than manic episodes
rapid cycling, or four or more episodes
of mania and depression in 1 year
more co-occurring conditions
Females with bipolar disorder may also experience relapse more often, partly due to hormone changes related to menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause. In terms of bipolar disorder, relapse means having a mood episode after not having one for some time.
Get the facts about bipolar disorder in females.
Males with bipolar disorder, on the other hand, may:
get a diagnosis earlier in life
experience less frequent but more severe episodes, especially manic episodes
be more likely to also have a substance use disorder
show more aggression during episodes of mania"
manic disorder,"for manic disorder, bipolar disorder in historically marginalized groups?","Research
shows that people from historically marginalized groups, particularly those of African ancestry, are frequently misdiagnosed with other conditions like schizophrenia, especially if they exhibit symptoms of psychosis.
While the symptoms of bipolar disorder can vary somewhat from person to person and can depend on the type, there are clear criteria for diagnosis.
Research also suggests 50-75% of people living with bipolar disorder will experience some symptoms of psychosis, but this is stable across all racial and ethnic groups.
Both these factors suggest that bias may play a role in this frequent misdiagnosis.

manic disorder,"for manic disorder, bipolar disorder in children and teens?","Diagnosing bipolar disorder in children is controversial, largely because children don�t always display the same bipolar disorder symptoms as adults. Their moods and behaviors may also not follow the standards doctors use to diagnose the disorder in adults.
Many bipolar disorder symptoms that occur in children also overlap with symptoms of other conditions that commonly occur in children, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
However, in the last few decades, doctors and mental health professionals have come to recognize the condition in children. A diagnosis can help children get treatment, but reaching a diagnosis may take many weeks or months. It may be worth seeking care from a professional who specializes in treating children with mental health conditions.
Like adults, children with bipolar disorder experience extreme mood shifts. They can appear
very happy and show signs of excitable behavior, or seem very tearful, low, and irritable.
All children experience mood changes, but bipolar disorder causes distinct and noticeable mood symptoms. Mood changes are also usually more extreme than a child�s typical change in mood.
Manic symptoms in children
Symptoms of mania in children can include:
acting very silly and feeling overly happy
talking fast and rapidly changing subjects
having trouble focusing or concentrating
engaging in behaviors that can have harmful effects
having a very short temper that leads quickly to outbursts of anger
having trouble sleeping and not feeling tired after sleep loss
Depressive symptoms in children
With bipolar disorder, symptoms of depressive episodes in children can include:
moping around, acting very sad, or crying frequently
sleeping too much or too little
having little energy for usual activities or showing no signs of interest in anything
complaining about not feeling well, including having frequent headaches or stomachaches
feelings of worthlessness or guilt
eating too little or too much
thoughts of death or suicide
Other possible diagnoses
Some of the behavior issues you notice in your child could suggest other mental health conditions, such as ADHD or depression. It�s also possible for children to have bipolar disorder with another condition.
Your child�s doctor can offer more guidance and support with noting and tracking your child�s behaviors, which can help them find the right diagnosis.
The correct diagnosis can play a major role in finding the most effective treatment for your child. Treatment, of course, can make a big difference in your child�s symptoms, not to mention their quality of life.

Symptoms in teens
Shifting hormones, plus the life changes that naturally happen with puberty, can make teens seem extremely emotional from time to time.
Yet drastic or rapidly fluctuating changes in mood may suggest a more serious condition, such as bipolar disorder, rather than typical teenage development.
A bipolar disorder diagnosis is most common during the late teen and early adult years.
Common symptoms of mania in teenagers include:
being very happy
�acting out� or misbehaving
taking part in behaviors that may have a harmful effect, like substance use
thinking about sex more than usual
becoming overly sexual or sexually active
having trouble sleeping, without signs of fatigue or being tired
having a very short temper
having trouble staying focused or getting distracted easily
Common symptoms of a depressive episode include:
sleeping too much or too little
eating too much or too little
feeling very sad and showing little excitability
withdrawing from activities and friends
thinking or talking about death and suicide
Remember that many of these signs, like experimenting with substances and thinking about sex, aren�t uncommon teenage behaviors. But if they seem part of a larger pattern of shifting moods or start to affect their day-to-day life, they could be a sign of bipolar disorder or another condition.

Some potential causes of bipolar disorder include:
Genetics
If your parent or sibling has bipolar disorder, you�re more likely to develop the condition. The risk of developing bipolar disorder is 10% to 25%
if one of your parents has the condition.
Keep in mind, though, that most people who have a history of bipolar disorder in their family history don�t develop it.

Your brain
Your brain structure may affect your risk of developing bipolar disorder. Irregularities in brain chemistry, or the structure or functions of your brain, may increase this risk.
Environmental factors

suggests that anxiety disorders are among the most common.
Other conditions that might occur alongside bipolar disorder include:
substance use disorders
eating disorders
specific phobia
ADHD
Symptoms of these conditions might show up more severely depending on your mood state. Anxiety, for example, tends to happen more commonly with depression, while substance use might be more likely with mania.
If you have bipolar disorder, you may also have a higher chance of developing certain medical conditions, including:
migraine
heart disease
diabetes
thyroid disorders"
manic disorder,"for manic disorder, tips for coping and support?","If you�ve noticed symptoms of bipolar disorder, a good first step involves reaching out to a doctor or therapist as soon as possible.
Similarly, if a friend or loved one has symptoms, consider encouraging them to connect with a therapist as soon as possible. It never hurts to remind them that they have your understanding and support.
Here�s how you can support a loved one living with bipolar disorder.
Always take suicidal thoughts and behavior seriously
It�s not uncommon to have thoughts of suicide during an episode of depression or a mixed features mood episode.

Living with bipolar disorder
Treatment can help you manage mood episodes and cope with the symptoms they cause.
Creating a care team can help you get the most out of treatment. Your team might involve:
your primary doctor
a psychiatrist who manages your medications
a therapist or counselor who provides talk therapy
other professionals or specialists, such as a sleep specialist, acupuncturist, or massage therapist
a bipolar disorder support group or community of other people also living with bipolar disorder
You may need to try a few treatments before you find one that leads to improvement. Some medications work well for some people but not others. In a similar vein, some people find CBT very helpful, while others may see little improvement.
It�s always best to be open with your care team about what works and what doesn�t. If something doesn�t help or makes you feel even worse, don�t hold back from letting them know. Your mental health matters and your care team should always support you in finding the most helpful approach.
A little self-compassion can go a long way, too. Remember that bipolar disorder, like any other mental health condition, didn�t happen by choice. It�s not caused by anything you did or didn�t do.
It�s OK (and pretty common) to feel frustrated when treatment doesn�t seem to work. Try to have patience and treat yourself kindly as you explore new approaches.
Bipolar disorder and relationships
Bipolar disorder can affect your relationships. But these effects might appear most clearly in your closest relationships, like those with family members and romantic partners.
When it comes to managing a relationship while living with bipolar disorder, honesty can always help. Being open about your condition can help your partner better understand your symptoms and how they can offer support.
You might consider starting with a few basic details, including:
how long you�ve had the condition
how episodes of depression usually affect you
how episodes of mania usually affect you
your treatment approach, including therapy, medication, and coping strategies

What can you tell me about personality disorder? Could you describe what personality disorder is? I�d like to know more about personality disorder. Can you help? What information do you have on personality disorder? Could you provide information on personality disorder?,"Histrionic personality disorder (HPD) is part of a larger group of psychological disorders called �Cluster B� personality disorders. Disorders in this category cause a person to be overly dramatic, emotional, or erratic.
People with HPD have a distorted mental image of themselves. They often base their self-esteem on the approval of others. This creates a need to be noticed. Because of this, people with HPD may resort to dramatic antics.
Women are diagnosed with HPD more often than men. That may be because men report their symptoms less often than women."
personality disorder,"for personality disorder, recognizing the signs of histrionic personality disorder?","HPD is not a devastating psychological disorder. Most people with HPD function successfully in society and at work. In fact, people with HPD usually have great people skills. Unfortunately, they often use these skills to manipulate others.
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edition), people with histrionic personality disorder have at least five (or more) of the following symptoms:
Is uncomfortable in situations in which they are not the center of attention
Has interactions with others characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or provocative behavior
Displays rapidly shifting and shallow expression of emotions
Consistently uses their physical attention to draw attention to self
Has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in detail
Shows self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of emotion
Is suggestible (that is, they are easily influenced by others or circumstances)
Considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are
If you have HPD, you might also be easily frustrated or bored with routines, make rash decisions before thinking, or threaten to commit suicide in order to get attention."
personality disorder,"for personality disorder, what causes histrionic personality disorder??","The exact cause of histrionic personality disorder is unknown. Scientists believe it is an outcome of both environmental and genetic factors.
Some families have a history of HPD, which lends credit to the theory that the condition may be explained in part by genetics. On the other hand, children of parents with HPD may simply exhibit behavior they learned from their parents. It is also possible that a lack of discipline or positive reinforcement of dramatic behaviors in childhood can cause HPD. A child may learn HPD behaviors as a way to get attention from their parents.
No matter the cause, HPD usually presents itself by early adulthood."
personality disorder,"for personality disorder, diagnosis of hpd?","There is no specific test that is used to diagnose HPD. If you are troubled by your symptoms and seek medical care, your primary care provider will likely begin by taking a complete medical history. They may perform a physical exam to rule out any physical problems that might be causing your symptoms.
If your primary care provider doesn�t find a physical cause for your symptoms, they may refer you to a psychiatrist. Psychiatrists are specifically trained to recognize and treat psychological disorders. A psychiatrist will be able to use expert questions to get a clear view of the history of your behavior. An accurate assessment of your behaviors will help your primary care provider diagnose you.
However, most people with this condition do not believe they need therapy or help, making diagnosis difficult. Many people who have HPD receive a diagnosis after they go into therapy for depression or anxiety, usually following a failed relationship or other personal conflicts."

Like many people with HPD, you might think you don�t need treatment, or you might find the routine of a treatment program to be unappealing. However, therapy � and sometimes medications � can help you cope with HPD.
Therapy
Psychotherapy is the most common and effective treatment choice for HPD. This kind of therapy involves talking to a therapist about your feelings and experiences. Such talks can help you and your therapist determine the reasoning behind your actions and behaviors. Your therapist may be able to help you learn how to relate with people in a positive manner, instead of continually trying to get attention from them.
Medication
If you experience depression or anxiety as a part of your HPD, your primary care provider might put you on antidepressants or antianxiety medication."
personality disorder,"for personality disorder, long-term outlook for a person with hpd?","Lots of people with HPD lead normal lives and are able to work and be a part of society. In fact, many people with HPD do very well in casual settings. Many of them only encounter problems in more intimate relationships. Depending on your case, your HPD may affect your ability to hold a job, maintain a relationship, or stay focused on life goals. It may also cause you to constantly seek adventure, putting you into risky situations.
You are also at a higher risk for depression if you have HPD. The disorder can affect how you handle failure and loss. It can also leave you feeling more frustrated when you don�t get what you want. You should talk to your primary care provider if you have symptoms of HPD, especially if they are interfering with your everyday life and work or your ability to lead a happy, fulfilling life."

What can you tell me about emphysema pulmonary? Could you describe what emphysema pulmonary is? I�d like to know more about emphysema pulmonary. Can you help? What information do you have on emphysema pulmonary? Could you provide information on emphysema pulmonary?,"Emphysema is a disease of the lungs. It occurs most often in people who smoke, but it also occurs in people who regularly breathe in irritants.
Emphysema destroys alveoli, which are air sacs in the lungs. The air sacs weaken and eventually break, which reduces the surface area of the lungs and the amount of oxygen that can reach the bloodstream. This makes it harder to breathe, especially when exercising. Emphysema also causes the lungs to lose their elasticity.
Emphysema is one of the two most common conditions that fall under the umbrella term chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The other major COPD condition is chronic bronchitis. Emphysema is an irreversible condition, so treatment aims to slow its progression and minimize symptoms."
emphysema pulmonary,"for emphysema pulmonary, what are the symptoms of emphysema??","Some people have emphysema for years without knowing it. Some of its first signs are shortness of breath and coughing, especially during exercise or physical exertion. This continues to get worse until breathing is difficult all the time, even when resting.
Other symptoms may include:
exhaustion
weight loss
depression
Some people may develop bluish-gray lips or fingernails from lack of oxygen. If this happens, seek medical attention immediately."
emphysema pulmonary,"for emphysema pulmonary, causes and risk factors?","According to the American Lung Association, 2 million adults (1.6 percent of people ages 18 years or older) had emphysema in 2018.
Rates were higher among males, non-Hispanic white people, and those over the age of 65. However, the rates among females have been increasing in recent decades, so the gap between the sexes has been decreasing.
Smoking tobacco is the main cause of emphysema. The more you smoke, the higher your risk of developing emphysema. This includes smoking cannabis.
Smoking leads to the death of more than 480,000 Americans a year, and 80 percent of those deaths are caused by COPD, including emphysema. Exposure to secondhand smoke also increases your risk of developing emphysema.
Other causes of, as well as potential risk factors for developing emphysema, may include:
exposure to high pollution chemical fumes or lung irritants
a genetic condition called alpha-1 deficiency can lead to a rare form of emphysema called alpha-1 deficiency-related emphysema.
history of childhood respiratory infections
a compromised immune system, especially as a result of HIV
rare disorders such as Marfan syndrome."
emphysema pulmonary,"for emphysema pulmonary, how is emphysema diagnosed??","Your doctor will begin by getting your background and medical history, asking in particular whether you smoke and whether you�re around hazardous fumes or pollutants at work or at home.
Various tests can detect emphysema, including:
imaging tests, such as X-rays and CT scans, to look at your lungs
blood tests, to determine how well your lungs are transferring oxygen
pulse oximetry, to measure the oxygen content of your blood
lung function tests, which measure how much air your lungs can breathe in and out and how well your lungs deliver oxygen into your bloodstream
arterial blood gas tests, to measure the amount of blood and carbon dioxide in your blood
electrocardiogram (ECG), to check heart function and rule out heart disease"
emphysema pulmonary,"for emphysema pulmonary, complications?","When emphysema becomes severe or isn�t properly treated, serious complications may occur. These may include:
pneumonia, which can bacterial or viral
many respiratory tract infections
cor pulmonale, which is failure of the right side of the heart
pneumothorax, which is when air collects between the lungs and the chest cavity that can lead to lung collapse
respiratory acidosis, which is when the lungs can�t obtain enough oxygen, leading to coma
hypoxemia, which is when the lungs can�t adequately oxygenate the blood"
emphysema pulmonary,"for emphysema pulmonary, how is emphysema treated??","There�s no cure for emphysema. Treatment aims to reduce symptoms and slow the progression of the disease with medications, therapies, or surgeries.
If you smoke, the first step in treating emphysema is to quit smoking. You may need medications to help you withdraw from nicotine. Consider discussing a cessation plan with your doctor.
Medications
Various medications can help treat the disease, including:
bronchodilators, which help open air passages, making breathing easier and relieving coughing and shortness of breath
steroids, which alleviate shortness of breath
antibiotics, which fight infections that can make the condition worse
All of these medications can be taken orally or inhaled.
Therapies
Pulmonary rehabilitation or moderate exercise such as walking can strengthen breathing muscles and alleviate symptoms, making it easier to breathe and be physically active. Yoga, tai chi, and deep breathing exercises can also help relieve symptoms.
Oxygen therapy can help make breathing easier. People with severe emphysema may need oxygen 24 hours a day.
Surgery
Lung volume reduction surgery may be used to remove small parts of damaged lung, and a lung transplant can replace the entire lung. These are rare surgeries used only for people with severe emphysema.
Other treatments
Emphysema might cause you to become underweight. Eating foods rich in vitamins A, C, and E, like fruits and vegetables, is recommended to improve your overall health.
Getting vaccinated against certain infections, such as pneumonia, can help prevent you from getting an infection that could complicate emphysema. These infections include pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19.
You may also experience anxiety and depression if you aren�t as active as you used to be. Joining a support group can help you connect with others who have the disease and share similar experiences. This can help you realize that you aren�t alone in fighting the disease."
emphysema pulmonary,"for emphysema pulmonary, prevention and outlook?","Since emphysema is mainly caused by smoking tobacco, the best way to prevent it is to refrain from smoking. It�s also important to stay away from harmful chemicals and fumes as well as heavy pollution.
The outlook for people with emphysema varies based on its severity. There�s no cure for the disease, and it worsens with time, but you can slow its progression.
As a rule, smoking cigarettes speeds up the disease, so quitting is important.
Early detection of the disease is key, because people with emphysema can develop life threatening conditions when the lungs and heart become damaged over time.
It�s important to stay healthy by eating well and getting exercise. With the aid of medications and therapies, you can live a long, healthy life with emphysema."

Treatment can include topical products and using a cold compress. Severe hemorrhoids may need medical intervention.
You�ve probably heard of hemorrhoids, also called piles. They are inflamed veins that cause lumps around your anus, and they can be quite painful.
Hemorrhoids can be internal or external, and it�s possible to have both types at the same time.
Both types often go away on their own, but sometimes require medical intervention.
Hemorrhoids are common, affecting about 1 in 20 people in the United States overall and about half of people over age 50, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)
.
They also tend to happen more often in certain people, including pregnant people and those who frequently strain while pooping."
hemorrhoids,"for hemorrhoids, what causes external hemorrhoids??","External hemorrhoids are when one or more tender bumps form beneath the skin surrounding your anus. These are dilated blood vessels that have become so enlarged that they protrude.
Blood may clot, or thrombose, inside the protruding blood vessel. This can form a hard lump and cause considerable pain in some cases.
External and internal hemorrhoids are caused by many of the same factors. These include:
Straining while pooping. The most common cause of external hemorrhoids is repeated straining while having a bowel movement. This is often caused by severe cases of constipation or diarrhea. Straining makes blood pool in the area.
Sitting on the toilet for a long time. This can also put pressure on the tissues around your rectum and anus.
Weakened support tissues. As you age, the tissues tend to weaken around the anus and rectum.
Pregnancy. Pregnant people may also be at an increased risk of hemorrhoids because of the increased pressure of the abdomen on these veins.
Obesity. Having excess weight has been associated with having hemorrhoids.
Heavy lifting. You may have a higher risk of hemorrhoids if you frequently lift heavy objects.
Not eating enough fiber. A low fiber diet may lead to constipation, which can cause hemorrhoids."

one or more tender, blue-colored lumps on the skin near the opening of the anus
itching around the anus or rectal area
aching or pain around your anus, particularly within 24 to 48 hours of onset and when you�re sitting down
You may notice bleeding when you�re using the toilet. This includes seeing blood on toilet paper or in the toilet. Lumps around the anus may feel as if they are swollen. Larger external hemorrhoids may make it difficult to keep the anal area clean.
These symptoms may also occur because of other conditions. If you experience them, you should schedule an exam with your doctor.
Symptoms of external hemorrhoids may go away after a few days, according to the NIDDK

hemorrhoids,"for hemorrhoids, who is at risk of external hemorrhoids??","If your parents have had hemorrhoids, you may be more likely to have them as well. Hemorrhoids may also be more likely to happen during pregnancy.
As we age, hemorrhoids can occur due to increased pressure caused by sitting a lot. And anything that causes you to strain during bowel movements can lead to external hemorrhoids.
A healthcare professional may be able to help you determine the cause of your hemorrhoids."
hemorrhoids,"for hemorrhoids, how are external hemorrhoids diagnosed??","To diagnose external hemorrhoids, a doctor will ask about your health history and symptoms. They will also likely do a physical exam.
In the case of external hemorrhoids, they will generally be able to see the hemorrhoids by examining the area around your anus.
They may also perform a digital rectum exam and anoscopy to check for issues inside your anal canal and rectum, including internal hemorrhoids.
During a digital rectal exam, your doctor will insert their gloved, lubricated finger into your anus. They�ll be able to feel abnormalities inside.
During an anoscopy, the doctor will insert a device called an anoscope into your rectum that allows them to see abnormalities.
If you also have rectal bleeding, your doctor will likely request that you get a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy to rule out colorectal cancer. These methods will also detect any internal hemorrhoids."
hemorrhoids,"for hemorrhoids, treating external hemorrhoids?","In most cases, people treat external hemorrhoids at home and they go away on their own.
They typically don�t require medical treatment unless they�re causing you a lot of pain or are very enlarged, according to experts
.
If you�re experiencing pain, your doctor may recommend using over-the-counter (OTC) pain relief medications, such as ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), or acetaminophen.
Home remedies
You can use at-home treatments to help with hemorrhoids.
Here are a few safe at-home remedies for hemorrhoids to try:
Cold compress. Wrap ice in a cloth and apply it to the hemorrhoid for periods of no more than 15 minutes at a time. This can significantly reduce swelling and pain.
Sitz bath. This is essentially soaking your bottom in warm water. Some people use a small tub designed to fit over your toilet, which you can fill with a couple of inches of warm water and sit in several times a day to help sooth hemorrhoids. Some people add unscented Epsom salts to the water.
Topical ointments or wipes. Some people use ointments or soothing wipes made with naturally derived ingredients, such as witch hazel and aloe vera, to help reduce hemorrhoid swelling and pain. However, many of these products need more research on their effectiveness.
OTC creams. Preparation H and other OTC topical medications may also help.
Contact a healthcare professional if you�re experiencing a lot of pain, if symptoms haven�t gone away after 1 week of treatment at home, or if you�re experiencing bleeding from your rectum.
Medical treatments
If you have a more severe case of external hemorrhoids, your doctor may suggest a surgical procedure called a hemorrhoidectomy. This is the removal of an external hemorrhoid using a laser, scalpel, or cautery device.
Your healthcare professional will likely use a local anesthetic for this procedure, depending on the situation and your needs.
If you have internal hemorrhoids, healthcare professionals may use additional or different methods for surgical treatment.
Healthcare professionals will sometimes recommend prescription medications for external hemorrhoids. These include:
topical nitroglycerin � 0.4% ointment
topical nifedipine
an injection of botulinum toxin (Botox) into the anal sphincter"

Avoid heavy lifting. Try not to strain yourself.
Ask for professional advice if you�re at higher risk. Speak with a healthcare professional if you�re at higher risk of constipation or hemorrhoids, such as if you�re pregnant, have a compromised immune system, or are taking medications to reduce blood clotting."
hemorrhoids,"for hemorrhoids, what is the long-term outlook for external hemorrhoids??","External hemorrhoids are a common condition. They often go away on their own within a few days or weeks as the body reabsorbs the blood clot within the protruding blood vessel.

Temporary aphasia can also occur due to a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which temporarily interrupts blood flow to your brain. A TIA is sometimes called a �ministroke.�
The effects of a TIA include:
weakness
numbness of certain body parts
difficulty speaking
difficulty understanding speech
A TIA is different from a stroke because its effects are temporary, but it can also be a precursor to an actual stroke. Anyone who believes they�ve just dealt with a TIA should talk with a doctor immediately."
aphasia,"for aphasia, who is at risk of aphasia??","Aphasia can affect people of all ages, including children.
Since strokes are the most common cause of aphasia, the majority of people with aphasia are middle-aged or older."
aphasia,"for aphasia, types of aphasia?","According to the National Aphasia Association, there are many types � or patterns � of aphasia. Out of these many types, there are a few that are quite prevalent.
Global aphasia
Global aphasia is the most severe type of aphasia, and it�s typically caused by major damage to the front and back of the left side of your brain. People with this type of aphasia usually have:
severe problems using words
severe problems understanding words
limited ability to use a few words together
an almost nonexistent ability to read or write
Broca�s aphasia
Broca�s aphasia is called �non-fluent aphasia� because of the difficulty a person has with speaking. Typically, Broca�s aphasia involves damage to the left frontal area of the brain. People with this type of aphasia usually:
speak in short, incomplete sentences
are able to convey basic messages but may be missing some words
have a limited ability to understand what others say
experience frustration because others can�t understand them
have weakness or paralysis on the right side of the body
Mixed non-fluent aphasia
With some symptoms similar to Broca�s aphasia � meaning limited and difficult speech � people with mixed non-fluent aphasia also:
have a limited comprehension of speech
can only read and write at a very elementary level
Wernicke�s aphasia
Also identified as fluent aphasia, Wernicke�s aphasia typically involves damage to the middle left side of the brain. People with this type of aphasia can speak but have trouble understanding when others speak. Additional symptoms include:
being unable to understand and use language correctly
tending to speak in long, complex sentences that are meaningless and include incorrect or nonsense words
not realizing that others can�t understand them
impaired reading and writing
Anomic aphasia
The main feature of this pattern of aphasia is difficulty finding words that you really want to use, particularly nouns and verbs. People with anomic aphasia can usually speak well, but their speech is usually full of expressions of frustration. Additionally:
they can understand others� speech well
they can read well
their difficulty in finding words is also evident in their writing
Primary progressive aphasia (PPA)
As the name suggests, this type of aphasia is progressive, which means it gets worse over time. Usually, PPA is a result of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer�s disease. Initially, symptoms start with a loss of language and speech but can progress to a loss of memory."
aphasia,"for aphasia, diagnosing aphasia?","If your doctor suspects you or someone you care for has aphasia, they may order imaging tests to find the source of the problem. A CT or MRI scan can help them identify the location and severity of the brain damage.
Your doctor may also screen you for aphasia during treatment for a brain injury or stroke. For example, they may test your ability to:
follow commands
name objects
participate in a conversation
answer questions
write words
read
If you have aphasia, a speech-language pathologist can help identify specific communication disabilities. During the examination, they�ll test your ability to:
speak clearly
express ideas coherently
interact with others
read
write
understand verbal and written language
use alternative forms of communication
swallow"
aphasia,"for aphasia, treating aphasia?","The specific treatment a doctor might recommend will depend on the type, or pattern, of aphasia. Overall, the goal of treatment is to help an individual gain the greatest independence possible.
Certain types of aphasia may improve with speech-language therapy. This therapy typically proceeds slowly and gradually, and it should be started as early as possible after a brain injury. Specific treatment plans may involve:
performing exercises to improve communication skills
working in groups to practice communication skills
testing communication skills in real-life situations
learning to use other forms of communication, such as gestures, drawings, and computer-mediated
communication
using computers to relearn word sounds and verbs
encouraging family involvement to help with communication at home
Emotional support in the form of talk therapy and family involvement may also be recommended, especially if a person is struggling with their diagnosis and the symptoms.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which is a noninvasive form of brain stimulation, is one new method that has also shown some promise when it comes to improving certain symptoms of aphasia. However, most of the studies around this method are currently only used in research settings."
aphasia,"for aphasia, preventing aphasia?","Many of the conditions that cause aphasia aren�t preventable, such as brain tumors or degenerative diseases. However, the most common cause of aphasia is stroke. If you can work on reducing your risk of stroke, you can lower your risk of aphasia.
You can take the following steps to lower your risk of stroke:
Try to stop smoking if you smoke.
Drink alcohol in moderation.
Prioritize exercise.
Eat a diet that�s lower in sodium and fat
Take steps to manage your blood pressure and cholesterol.
Take steps to manage diabetes or circulation problems if you have them.
Get treatment for atrial fibrillation if you have it.
Get immediate medical care if you develop the symptoms of a stroke."
aphasia,"for aphasia, what is the outlook for people who have aphasia??","If you have temporary aphasia due to a TIA or migraine attack, you may not need treatment, and symptoms may fade with time.
If you or someone you love has a more permanent type of aphasia, which is usually caused by stroke, brain trauma, an infection, or a neurodegenerative disease, several factors determine the outlook:
the cause of the brain damage
the location of the brain damage
the severity of the brain damage
your age
your overall health
Treating aphasia usually comes down to helping a person become as independent as possible with their condition. Emotional support, therapy, and other methods of healing may also be recommended."
aphasia,"for aphasia, communicating with someone who has aphasia?","If a loved one is living with aphasia, you may want to consider thinking about how you communicate with them. Consider the following methods to increase communication on both sides:
Minimize or completely eliminate background noise when speaking with them.
Keep your words simple but appropriately �adult.� There is no need to talk down to someone with aphasia.
Give the person time to speak. Resist the urge to finish their sentences.
Use gestures, drawings, or written notes to help your communication.
Downplay errors and encourage successes."

Could you describe what obesity morbid is? I�d like to know more about obesity morbid. Can you help? What information do you have on obesity morbid? Could you provide information on obesity morbid?,"What Is Morbid Obesity?
Morbid obesity is a condition in which you have a body mass index (BMI) higher than 35. BMI is used to estimate body fat and can help determine if you are at a healthy body weight for your size. BMI is not a perfect measurement but it does help give a general idea of ideal weight ranges for height."
obesity morbid,"for obesity morbid, what causes morbid obesity??","When you eat, your body uses the calories you consume to run your body. Even at rest, the body needs calories to pump your heart or digest food. If those calories are not used, the body stores them as fat. Your body will build up fat stores if you continue to eat more calories than your body can use during daily activities and exercise. Obesity and morbid obesity are the result of too much fat being stored in your body.
Certain medications, such as antidepressants, can cause weight gain. Medical conditions such as hypothyroidism can also lead to weight gain, but can usually be managed so that they do not lead to obesity."
obesity morbid,"for obesity morbid, who is at risk for morbid obesity??","Anyone can gain weight and develop obesity if they eat more calories than their bodies can use.
Some studies
have shown that genetic factors
can play a role in how your body stores energy. More research is being done to further explore the relationship between genes and weight.
Many behavioral factors play a role in obesity as well, including your eating habits and daily activity level. Many people develop their eating habits as children and have trouble refining them to maintain proper body weight as they age. As an adult, you may be inactive at your job and have less time for exercise, meal planning, and physical activity.
Other factors, such as stress, anxiety, and lack of sleep, can lead to weight gain. People who quit smoking often experience temporary weight gain. Women may also have trouble losing the weight they gain during pregnancy, or may gain additional weight during menopause. These factors do not necessarily lead to morbid obesity but can certainly contribute to its onset."
obesity morbid,"for obesity morbid, diagnosing morbid obesity?","Your doctor will perform a physical exam and ask you about the history of your weight and your weight-loss efforts. They will ask you about your eating and exercise habits, and your medical history.
Calculating BMI
BMI is calculated when your weight in kilograms is divided by your height in meters squared. You can calculate your BMI by using a calculator
provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Here are BMI ranges and their corresponding categories of obesity:
underweight: under 18.5 percent
normal: 18.5 to 24.9 percent
overweight: 25.0 to 29.9
obese (class 1): 30.0 and 34.9
morbid obesity (class 2): 35-39.9
Using BMI as a diagnosis tool for obesity has limitations. Your BMI is only an estimate of your body fat. For example, athletes may have a high weight because of their higher muscle mass. They could fall into the BMI range of obesity or morbid obesity, but actually have a small amount of body fat. Because of this, your doctor might use other tests to get an exact reading of your body fat percentage.
Calculating Body Fat Percentage
A skinfold test may also be done to check your body fat percentage. In this test, a doctor measures the thickness of a fold of skin from the arm, abdomen, or thigh with a caliper. Another way to test body fat percentage includes bioelectrical impedance, which is often done using a special type of scale. Finally, body fat can be more accurately measured using special equipment to calculate water or air displacement.
Other Tests
Your doctor may order additional blood tests to look for hormonal or other medical problems that could be causing your weight gain.

obesity morbid,"for obesity morbid, complications of morbid obesity?","Obesity is a health concern. Without proper treatment, obesity can lead to other serious health problems, such as:
osteoarthritis
heart disease and blood lipid abnormalities
stroke
type 2 diabetes
sleep apnea (when you periodically stop breathing during sleep)
reproductive problems
gallstones
certain cancers
obesity hypoventilation syndrome
metabolic syndrome"
obesity morbid,"for obesity morbid, treating morbid obesity?","There are several different treatment options for morbid obesity.
Diet and Exercise
There is no data on the most effective way to induce long-term weight loss, but a healthy diet and regular exercise are the keys to overall health.
It is also important to learn stress management tools that can be used in place of overeating or snacking during stressful times.
You should work with your doctor and a dietitian to set realistic goals that will help you lose weight slowly through diet and exercise. It may be helpful to find support from friends, family, or your community in order to make lifestyle changes that will lead to long-term weight loss.
Weight Loss Drugs
In some cases weight loss drugs may be prescribed. These medications may cause weight loss, but most people regain the weight once they stop taking the medication. There are many herbal and over-the-counter supplements that claim to help you lose weight, but many of these claims have not been verified.
Surgery
Surgery may also be an option to treat obesity if you have tried other methods for losing weight but have not been successful in maintaining long-term weight loss. It can often help reduce the risk of other diseases (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, and sleep apnea) that are associated with severe obesity.
Surgery may cause complications, and you should talk with your doctor to determine if this is an option for you. There are two common types of weight-loss surgeries:
Gastric Banding Surgery
In this procedure, the surgeon will place a band around the upper part of your stomach. This limits the amount of food you can eat at one time by making you feel full after eating small amounts of food.
Gastric Bypass Surgery
This surgery will change how the food you eat travels through your digestive tract by bypassing a portion of your stomach and small bowel. It will make you feel full when you�ve eaten less food."
obesity morbid,"for obesity morbid, preventing morbid obesity?","Obesity and morbid obesity are serious and potentially life-threatening conditions. A healthy lifestyle that includes a healthy diet and regular exercise are important for preventing obesity.
Diet and Exercise
People who have morbid obesity should avoid �fad� diets and focus instead on changing eating behaviors. Recommendations include:
adding more fruits and vegetables to your diet
eating smaller meals
count calories
eating mindfully
limiting saturated fats, trans fats, and refined sugars
Physical activity is good for overall health and is especially important if you�re trying to lose weight. To begin losing weight, you will need to do moderate to vigorous exercise for more than three hours per week. Vigorous activity raises your heart rate significantly. Be sure to check with your doctor before you begin any vigorous exercise programs. Examples of beneficial physical activity include:
running or jogging
swimming
jumping rope
brisk walking
biking
Moderate exercise can also include everyday activities like shoveling snow or yard work."
pyelonephritis,what is pyelonephritis? Tell me about pyelonephritis? What kind of disease is pyelonephritis? Can you elaborate on pyelonephritis? What can you tell me about pyelonephritis? Could you describe what pyelonephritis is? I�d like to know more about pyelonephritis. Can you help? What information do you have on pyelonephritis? Could you provide information on pyelonephritis?,"Understanding pyelonephritis
Acute pyelonephritis is a sudden and severe kidney infection. It causes the kidneys to swell and may permanently damage them. Pyelonephritis can be life-threatening.
When repeated or persistent attacks occur, the condition is called chronic pyelonephritis. The chronic form is rare, but it happens more often in children or people with urinary obstructions."
pyelonephritis,"for pyelonephritis, what are the symptoms??","Symptoms usually appear within two days of infection. Common symptoms include:
a fever greater than 102�F (38.9�C)
pain in the abdomen, back, side, or groin
painful or burning urination
cloudy urine
pus or blood in the urine
urgent or frequent urination
fishy-smelling urine
Other symptoms can include:
shaking or chills
nausea
vomiting
general aching or ill feeling
fatigue
moist skin
mental confusion
Symptoms may be different in children and older adults than they are in other people. For example, mental confusion is common in older adults and is often their only symptom.
People with chronic pyelonephritis may experience only mild symptoms or may even lack noticeable symptoms altogether."
pyelonephritis,"for pyelonephritis, what are the causes??","The infection usually starts in the lower urinary tract as a urinary tract infection (UTI). Bacteria enter the body through the urethra and begin to multiply and spread up to the bladder. From there, the bacteria travel through the ureters to the kidneys.
Bacteria such as E. coli often cause the infection. However, any serious infection in the bloodstream can also spread to the kidneys and cause acute pyelonephritis."
pyelonephritis,"for pyelonephritis, are there risk factors??","Acute pyelonephritis
Any problem that interrupts the normal flow of urine causes a greater risk of acute pyelonephritis. For example, a urinary tract that�s an unusual size or shape is more likely to lead to acute pyelonephritis.
Also, women�s urethras are much shorter than men�s, so it�s easier for bacteria to enter their bodies. That makes women more prone to kidney infections and puts them at a higher risk of acute pyelonephritis.
Other people who are at increased risk include:
anyone with chronic kidney stones or other kidney or bladder conditions
older adults
people with suppressed immune systems, such as people with diabetes, HIV/AIDS, or cancer
people with vesicoureteral reflux (a condition where small amounts of urine back up from the bladder into the ureters and kidneys)
people with an enlarged prostate
Other factors that can make you vulnerable to infection include:
catheter use
cystoscopic examination
urinary tract surgery
certain medications
nerve or spinal cord damage
Chronic pyelonephritis
Chronic forms of the condition are more common in people with urinary obstructions. These can be caused by UTIs, vesicoureteral reflux, or anatomical anomalies. Chronic pyelonephritis is more common in children than in adults."
pyelonephritis,"for pyelonephritis, diagnosing pyelonephritis?","Urine tests
A doctor will check for fever, tenderness in the abdomen, and other common symptoms. If they suspect a kidney infection, they will order a urine test. This helps them check for bacteria, concentration, blood, and pus in the urine.
Imaging tests
The doctor may also order an ultrasound to look for cysts, tumors, or other obstructions in the urinary tract.
For people who don�t respond to treatment within 72 hours, a CT scan (with or without injectable dye) may be ordered. This test can also detect obstructions within the urinary tract.
Radioactive imaging
A dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) test may be ordered if your doctor suspects scarring as a result of pyelonephritis. This is an imaging technique that tracks an injection of radioactive material.
A healthcare professional injects the material through a vein in the arm. The material then travels to the kidneys. Images taken as the radioactive material passes through the kidneys show infected or scarred areas."
pyelonephritis,"for pyelonephritis, treating pyelonephritis?","Antibiotics
Antibiotics are the first course of action against acute pyelonephritis. However, the type of antibiotic your doctor chooses depends on whether or not the bacteria can be identified. If not, a broad-spectrum antibiotic is used.
Although drugs can cure the infection within 2 to 3 days, the medication must be taken for the entire prescription period (usually 10 to 14 days). This is true even if you feel better.
The antibiotic options are:
levofloxacin
ciprofloxacin
co-trimoxazole
ampicillin
Hospital admission
In some cases, drug therapy is ineffective. For a severe kidney infection, your doctor may admit you to the hospital. The length of your stay depends on the severity of your condition and how well you respond to treatment.
Treatment may include intravenous hydration and antibiotics for 24 to 48 hours. While you�re in the hospital, doctors will monitor your blood and urine to track the infection. You�ll likely receive 10 to 14 days� worth of oral antibiotics to take after you�re released from the hospital.
Surgery
Recurrent kidney infections may result from an underlying medical problem. In those cases, surgery may be required to remove any obstructions or to correct any structural problems in the kidneys. Surgery may also be necessary to drain an abscess that doesn�t respond to antibiotics.
In cases of severe infection, a nephrectomy may be necessary. In this procedure, a surgeon removes part of the kidney."
pyelonephritis,"for pyelonephritis, pyelonephritis in pregnant women?","Pregnancy causes many temporary changes in the body, including physiological changes in the urinary tract. Increased progesterone and increased pressure on the ureters can result in an increased risk of pyelonephritis.
Pyelonephritis in pregnant women typically requires hospital admission. It can threaten the lives of both mother and baby. It can also increase the risk of premature delivery. Pregnant women are treated with beta-lactam antibiotics for at least 24 hours until their symptoms improve.
To prevent pyelonephritis in pregnant women, a urine culture should be conducted between the 12th and 16th weeks of pregnancy. A UTI that doesn�t have symptoms can lead to the development of pyelonephritis. Detecting the UTI early can prevent kidney infection."
pyelonephritis,"for pyelonephritis, pyelonephritis in children?","According to the American Urological Association, in the United States, more than one million trips to the pediatrician are made each year for pediatric UTIs. Girls are at increased risk if over one year old. Boys are at greater risk if under one, especially if they�re uncircumcised.
Children with UTIs often have fever, pain, and symptoms related to the urinary tract. A doctor should address these symptoms immediately before they can develop into pyelonephritis.
Most children can be treated with oral antibiotics in an outpatient manner. Learn more about UTIs in children."
pyelonephritis,"for pyelonephritis, potential complications?","A possible complication of acute pyelonephritis is chronic kidney disease. If the infection continues, the kidneys may be permanently damaged. Although rare, it�s also possible for the infection to enter the bloodstream. This can result in a potentially deadly infection called sepsis.
Other complications include:
recurring kidney infections
the infection spreading to areas around the kidneys
acute kidney failure
kidney abscess"
pyelonephritis,"for pyelonephritis, preventing pyelonephritis?","Pyelonephritis can be a serious condition. Contact your doctor as soon as you suspect that you have pyelonephritis or a UTI. This condition requires prompt medical attention, so the earlier you start treatment, the better.
Prevention tips
Drink plenty of fluids to increase urination and remove bacteria from the urethra.
Urinate after sex to help flush out bacteria.
Wipe from front to back.
Avoid using products that can irritate the urethra, such as douches or feminine sprays.

endocarditis,what is endocarditis? Tell me about endocarditis? What kind of disease is endocarditis? Can you elaborate on endocarditis? What can you tell me about endocarditis? Could you describe what endocarditis is? I�d like to know more about endocarditis. Can you help? What information do you have on endocarditis? Could you provide information on endocarditis?,"What is endocarditis?
Endocarditis is inflammation of your heart�s inner lining, called the endocardium. It�s usually caused by bacteria. When the inflammation is caused by infection, the condition is called infective endocarditis. Endocarditis is uncommon in people with healthy hearts."
endocarditis,"for endocarditis, what are the symptoms of endocarditis??","The symptoms of endocarditis aren�t always severe, and they may develop slowly over time. In the early stages of endocarditis, the symptoms are similar to many other illnesses. This is why many cases go undiagnosed.
Many of the symptoms are similar to cases of the flu or other infections, such as pneumonia. However, some people experience severe symptoms that appear suddenly. These symptoms may be due to inflammation or the associated damage it causes.
Common symptoms of endocarditis include:
heart murmur, which is an abnormal heart sound of turbulent blood flow through the heart
pale skin
fever or chills
night sweats
muscle or joint pain
nausea or decreased appetite
a full feeling in the upper left part of your abdomen
unintentional weight loss
swollen feet, legs, or abdomen
cough or shortness of breath
Less common symptoms of endocarditis include:
blood in your urine
weight loss
an enlarged spleen, which may be tender to touch
Changes in the skin may also occur, including:
tender red or purple spots below the skin of fingers or toes
tiny red or purple spots from blood cells that leaked out of ruptured capillary vessels, which usually appear on the whites of the eyes, inside the cheeks, on the roof of the mouth, or on the chest
The signs and symptoms of infectious endocarditis vary greatly from person to person. They can change over time, and they depend on the cause of your infection, heart health, and how long the infection has been present. If you have a history of heart problems, heart surgery, or prior endocarditis, you should contact your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms. It�s especially important to contact your doctor if you have a constant fever that will not break or you�re unusually tired and don�t know why."
endocarditis,"for endocarditis, what are the causes of endocarditis??","The main cause of endocarditis is an overgrowth of bacteria. Although these bacteria normally live on the inside or outside surfaces of your body, you might bring them inside to your bloodstream by eating or drinking. Bacteria could also enter through cuts in your skin or oral cavity. Your immune system normally fights off germs before they cause a problem, but this process fails in some people.
In the case of infective endocarditis, the germs travel through your bloodstream and into your heart, where they multiply and cause inflammation. Endocarditis can also be caused by fungi or other germs.
Eating and drinking aren�t the only ways that germs can enter your body. They can also get into your bloodstream through:
brushing your teeth
having poor oral hygiene or gum disease
having a dental procedure that cuts your gums
contracting a sexually transmitted disease
using a contaminated needle
through an indwelling urinary catheter or intravenous catheter"
endocarditis,"for endocarditis, risk factors for endocarditis?","Risk factors for developing endocarditis include the following:
injecting illicit intravenous drugs with a needle contaminated with bacteria or fungi
scarring caused by heart valve damage, which allows bacteria or germs to grow
tissue damage from having endocarditis in the past
having a heart defect
having an artificial heart valve replacement"
endocarditis,"for endocarditis, how is endocarditis diagnosed??","Your doctor will go over your symptoms and medical history before conducting any tests. After this review, they�ll use a stethoscope to listen to your heart. The following tests may also be done:
Blood test
If your doctor suspects you have endocarditis, a blood culture test will be ordered to confirm whether bacteria, fungi, or other microorganisms are causing it. Other blood tests can also reveal if your symptoms are caused by another condition, such as anemia.
Transthoracic echocardiogram
A transthoracic echocardiogram is a non-radiating imaging test used to view your heart and its valves. This test uses ultrasound waves to create an image of your heart, with the imaging probe placed on the front of your chest. Your doctor can use this imaging test to look for signs of damage or abnormal movements of your heart.
Transesophageal echocardiogram
When a transthoracic echocardiogram doesn�t provide enough information to assess your heart accurately, your doctor might order an additional imaging test called a transesophageal echocardiogram. This is used to view your heart by way of your esophagus.
Electrocardiogram
An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) may be requested to get a better view of your heart�s electrical activity. This test can detect an abnormal heart rhythm or rate. A technician will attach 12 to 15 soft electrodes to your skin. These electrodes are attached to electrical leads (wires), which are then attached to the EKG machine.
Chest X-ray
A collapsed lung or other lung problems can cause some of the same symptoms as endocarditis. A chest X-ray may be used to view your lungs and see if they�ve collapsed or if fluid has built up in them. A buildup of fluid is called pulmonary edema. The X-ray can help your doctor tell the difference between endocarditis and other conditions involving with your lungs."
endocarditis,"for endocarditis, how is endocarditis treated??","Antibiotics
If your endocarditis is caused by bacteria, it will be treated with intravenous antibiotic therapy. Your doctor will advise you to take antibiotics until your infection and related inflammation are effectively treated. You will likely receive these in a hospital for at least a week, until you show signs of improvement. You will need to continue antibiotic therapy upon discharge from the hospital. You may be able to transition to oral antibiotics later in your treatment. Antibiotic therapy typically takes up to six weeks
to complete.
Surgery
Prolonged infective endocarditis or damaged heart valves caused by endocarditis may require surgery to correct. Surgery may be done to remove any dead tissue, scar tissue, fluid buildup, or debris from infected tissue. Surgery may also be done to repair or remove your damaged heart valve, and replace it with either man-made material or animal tissue."
endocarditis,"for endocarditis, what are the complications associated with endocarditis??","Complications may develop from damage caused by your infection. These can include an abnormal heart rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation, blood clots, other organ injury, and hyperbilirubinemia with jaundice. Infected blood can also cause emboli, or clots, to travel to other parts of your body.
Other organs that can be affected include:
kidneys, which may become inflamed, causing a condition called glomerulonephritis
lungs
brain
bones, particularly your spinal column, which may become infected, causing osteomyelitis
Bacteria or fungi can circulate from your heart and affect these areas. These germs can also cause abscesses to develop in your organs or other parts of your body.
Additional severe complications that can arise from endocarditis include stroke and heart failure."
endocarditis,"for endocarditis, how can endocarditis be prevented??","Having good oral hygiene and keeping regular dental appointments can help lower the risk of bacteria building up in your mouth and getting into your bloodstream. This reduces your risk of developing endocarditis from an oral infection or injury. If you�ve undergone a dental treatment that was followed up with antibiotics, make sure to take your antibiotics as directed.
If you have a history of congenital heart disease, a heart surgery, or endocarditis, be on the watch for the signs and symptoms of endocarditis. Pay special attention to a persistent fever and unexplained fatigue. Contact your doctor as soon as possible if you have any of these symptoms.
You should also avoid:
body piercings
tattoos
IV drug use
any procedure that might allow germs to enter your blood"
pneumothorax,what is pneumothorax? Tell me about pneumothorax? What kind of disease is pneumothorax? Can you elaborate on pneumothorax? What can you tell me about pneumothorax? Could you describe what pneumothorax is? I�d like to know more about pneumothorax. Can you help? What information do you have on pneumothorax? Could you provide information on pneumothorax?,A collapsed lung is the medical term for when air escapes outside of the lungs into the chest. The pressure causes the lung to be unable to expand. This is also called pneumothorax.
pneumothorax,"for pneumothorax, what is pneumothorax (collapsed lung)??","Pneumothorax is the medical term for a collapsed lung. It occurs when air enters the space around your lungs (the pleural space). This can happen when an open injury in your lung tissue causes air to leak into the pleural space. The resulting increased pressure on the outside of your lung causes it to collapse.
Pneumothorax can be traumatic or nontraumatic.
Traumatic pneumothorax results from an injury, like a blow to the chest. Nontraumatic pneumothorax can happen if you have lung disease, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but it can also happen for no apparent reason in people without lung disease.
The long-term impact of pneumothorax can vary. If only a small amount of air is trapped in the pleural space, there may be no further complications. If the volume of air is larger or it affects the heart, it can be life-threatening."
pneumothorax,"for pneumothorax, symptoms of pneumothorax?","If pneumothorax results from trauma, the symptoms often appear at the time of the injury or shortly after. Symptoms of spontaneous pneumothorax might appear when a person is at rest. A sudden attack of chest pain is often the first symptom.
Symptoms may include:
a sudden, sharp, stabbing pain in the chest
rapid breathing or shortness of breath (dyspnea)
turning blue, known as cyanosis
a rapid
heart rate
low blood pressure
lung expansion on one side
a hollow sound if you tap on the chest
an enlarged jugular vein
anxiety
fatigue"
pneumothorax,"for pneumothorax, causes and types of pneumothorax?","There are different ways of categorizing pneumothorax, according to their causes or their impact.
One way of differentiating them is as follows
:
traumatic pneumothorax
nontraumatic pneumothorax
primary spontaneous
secondary spontaneous
Other subtypes with either traumatic or nontraumatic causes are:
simple, when it does not affect the position of other structures
tension, which affects the position of other structures, like the heart
open, when air moves in and out of an open wound in the chest
Traumatic pneumothorax
Traumatic pneumothorax occurs after some type of trauma or injury has happened to the chest or lung wall. It can be a minor or significant injury. The trauma can damage chest structures and cause air to leak into the pleural space.
Here are some types of injuries that can cause traumatic pneumothorax:
trauma to the chest from a motor vehicle accident
broken ribs
a blow to the chest during a contact sport, like football tackle
a stab or bullet wound to the chest
accidental damage during a medical procedure like a central line placement, ventilator use, lung biopsies, or CPR
diving, flying, or being at high altitude due to air pressure changes
Quick treatment of pneumothorax due to chest trauma is critical as it can lead to fatal complications like cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, shock, and death.
Nontraumatic pneumothorax
This type of pneumothorax is called spontaneous, as it does not result from trauma.
When primary spontaneous pneumothorax happens, there�s no clear reason why it occurs. It�s more likely
to happen:
in people who smoke
during pregnancy
in people with Marfan syndrome
in those with a family history of pneumothorax
in an otherwise healthy person with a tall, thin body
Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax can happen if a person has:
a form of COPD, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis
acute or chronic infection, like tuberculosis or pneumonia
lung cancer
cystic fibrosis
asthma
severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
collagen vascular disease
Inhaling drugs like cocaine or marijuana can also trigger it.
Tension pneumothorax
Tension pneumothorax is not a classification of pneumothorax but a term that reflects the severity of pneumothorax. You may experience
it if you have:
a blow to the chest
a penetrating injury
changes in pressure when diving, flying, or mountaineering
a spontaneous pneumothorax progressing to a tension type
some medical procedures"
pneumothorax,"for pneumothorax, risk factors for pneumothorax?","The risk factors
are different for a traumatic and spontaneous pneumothorax.
Risk factors for a traumatic pneumothorax include:
contact sports, like football or hockey
employment where there�s a risk of falls or other types of injury
having a medical procedure that involves the chest or lung area
ongoing assisted respiratory care
The people at highest risk of a nontraumatic pneumothorax include those who:
have a history of smoking
have an existing lung condition, like asthma or COPD
have a family history of pneumothorax, which may indicate genetic factors
have tall, slim bodies, as this can affect
pressure at the top of the lung
have inflammation in the small airways"
pneumothorax,"for pneumothorax, pneumothorax complications?","Pneumothorax can lead to a number of complications, some of which can be life-threatening.
They include:
respiratory failure or inability to breathe
pulmonary edema following treatment for pneumothorax
pneumohemothorax, when blood enters the chest cavity
pneumopericardium, when air enters the cavity around the heart
pneumoperitoneum, when are enters the space around the abdomen
bronchopulmonary fistula, when a passageway opens between the lungs and the space around them
heart attack
Tension pneumothorax can quickly progress to:
an inability to breathe
cardiovascular collapse
death
It�s essential to seek emergency medical help as soon as symptoms arise."
pneumothorax,"for pneumothorax, treatment of pneumothorax?","Treatment aims to relieve pressure on the lung and allow it to re-expand.
The options will depend on:
how severe the condition is
whether the chest cavity is continuing to expand
the cause
whether it�s happened before or has been going on for some time
If you have tension pneumothorax or pneumothorax due to an injury, this is a life-threatening emergency. You�ll need immediate medical care and possibly surgery.
Here are some of the treatment strategies:
Observation
If pneumothorax results from a small injury, it may heal without treatment within a few days. Check with a doctor before flying or diving after pneumothorax.
If you�re having trouble breathing, you may need oxygen. Using oxygen can also help speed up
the rate at which the lungs reabsorb air from the cavity.
Draining excess air
If the damage is significant or symptoms are severe, a surgeon may need to remove the air or carry out surgery.
Needle aspiration and chest tube insertion are two procedures designed to remove excess air from the pleural space in the chest. These can be done at the bedside without requiring general anesthesia.
In needle aspiration, the doctor inserts a needle into the cavity and extracts the air using a syringe.
For a chest tube insertion, the doctor will insert a hollowed tube between your ribs. This allows air to drain and the lung to reinflate. The tube may remain in place for 2 to 5 days or longer.
Surgery
The doctor may need to carry out a more invasive procedure to see what�s happening in your lungs, like a thoracotomy or thoracoscopy.
During a thoracotomy, your surgeon will create an incision in the pleural space to help them see the problem. During a thoracoscopy, also known as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), the doctor inserts a tiny camera through the chest wall to examine the lung.
If you�ve had repeated episodes of pneumothorax, you may need a small operation to repair any weak areas in the lung where the air is getting through. The doctor may also carry out pleurodesis, in which they stick the lung to the inside of the chest wall.
Other surgical options include:
sewing blisters closed
closing air leaks
or removing the collapsed portion of your lung, which is called a lobectomy
These interventions can reduce the risk of pneumothorax happening again."
pneumothorax,"for pneumothorax, diagnosing pneumothorax?","In many cases, a person with pneumothorax will need emergency medical treatment, and emergency doctors will carry out the evaluation and diagnosis.
A doctor will look for signs of air in the space around the lungs.
They�ll ask about:
symptoms
personal and family medical history
recent activities
any previous cases of pneumothorax
They may also carry out imaging tests, like:
an X-ray
a CT scan
a thoracic ultrasound"
pneumothorax,"for pneumothorax, pneumothorax outlook?","Your long-term outlook depends on the size of the pneumothorax, the cause, and any treatment you receive.
Most cases of primary spontaneous pneumothorax resolve with observation or minimal treatment. It�s rarely life-threatening. But there�s a 30 percent
chance that this type will recur within 5 years, and the risk of recurrence increases each time it happens.
It may take longer to recover if:
you have a large pneumothorax
you have a secondary spontaneous pneumothorax
you have an underlying lung condition
pneumothorax results from an injury
it�s not your first experience of pneumothorax
In around 10% of cases, secondary spontaneous pneumothorax is fatal. The risk is higher if you have HIV or COPD. The risk of this type recurring within 5 years is around 43 percent
, and the risk increases each time it happens.
Knowing your risk of developing pneumothorax and seeking help as soon as symptoms occur can help prevent severe complications."
pneumothorax,"for pneumothorax, summary?","Pneumothorax is a condition where air collects between the lungs and the chest cavity. In some cases, it�ll go away without treatment. In others, it can be life-threatening. This will depend on the size and cause of the problem.
There are different types of pneumothorax. Traumatic pneumothorax can happen if someone has an injury to the chest wall or lungs. Nontraumatic pneumothorax can affect people with COPD and other lung diseases, but it can also affect people without lung disease.
Treatment aims to remove the air and re-expand the lungs. In some cases, a surgeon may need to repair the lungs. Pneumothorax can be a life-threatening emergency. Anyone who experiences symptoms, like a sharp, stabbing pain in the chest, should seek immediate medical help."
delirium,what is delirium? Tell me about delirium? What kind of disease is delirium? Can you elaborate on delirium? What can you tell me about delirium? Could you describe what delirium is? I�d like to know more about delirium. Can you help? What information do you have on delirium? Could you provide information on delirium?,"Delirium is a sudden change in your alertness and thinking. People with delirium typically become confused and have trouble paying attention.
Delirium is an abrupt change to your mental state. It makes it difficult to think, remember, focus, and more. Some people with delirium become drowsy and quiet, while others can become agitated.
Symptoms of delirium generally appear quickly over a period of hours or days. The symptoms tend to fluctuate, meaning they are more severe at some times, and less severe at others.
You might experience delirium due to illness, infection, or medication side effects, among other reasons.
Delirium is a serious condition, but it�s often temporary. Your doctor will treat delirium by finding and treating the underlying causes."
delirium,"for delirium, types of delirium?","Delirium is categorized by its cause and characteristics.
Hypoactive delirium
People with hypoactive delirium may be:
unusually drowsy or sleepy
unable to focus or pay attention
quiet and withdrawn
slower than usual when moving their body
Hyperactive delirium
People with hyperactive delirium may:
appear agitated or anxious
speak fast or loud
become restless, or unable to sit still
respond negatively or aggresively to caregivers
seem watchful or paranoid
Mixed delirium
Mixed delirium is a combination of both hyperactive and hypoactive delirium. People with mixed delirium have hyperactive delirium symptoms at some times, and hypoactive delirium symptoms at other times.
Alcohol withdrawal delirium
Alcohol withdrawal delirium, or delirium tremens, is a form of the condition that can happen to people who drink large amounts of alcohol for many years. If someone who regularly drinks a lot suddenly tries to stop drinking, severe withdrawal including delirium is possible.
Delirium tremens is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment to prevent severe complications. If it�s left untreated, it can be fatal in up to 37%
of cases. Fortunately, early treatment greatly improves the outcomes."
delirium,"for delirium, what causes delirium??","Delirium happens when stressors like inflammation or infection interfere with your brain function. There are many possible causes.
The condition is very common among older adults who need hospital care. Around one-third of hospital patients over age 70 experience delirium at some point during their hospital stay. It�s possible for younger people to experience delirium too, although it�s less common.
Any condition or factor that significantly changes your brain function can cause severe mental confusion. These include:
certain medications, such as sedatives, blood pressure medications, sleeping pills, and pain relievers
acute illness
infections
worsening symptoms of a long-term (chronic) illness
lack of oxygen � for example, breathing difficulties from asthma
blocked arteries (ischemia) � for example, in the brain or heart
severe pain
dehydration
sleep deprivation
metabolic issues, such as low blood sugar or an electrolyte imbalance
alcohol withdrawal in people with long-term, heavy alcohol use
surgery or general anesthesia
Medication side effects are a major cause of delirium. Up to 39%
of the time, delirium is caused by medications."
delirium,"for delirium, who�s at risk for delirium??","In general, older adults with multiple health conditions are more likely to experience delirium. But it can happen in younger people, too.
Factors that may increase your risk for delirium include:
dementia, or symptoms of dementia without a formal diagnosis
age older than 70
male sex
a disability that makes it difficult to carry out basic tasks of living
living with multiple health conditions
impaired hearing or vision
mild cognitive impairment
symptoms of depression
alcohol use disorder
abnormal results on laboratory tests, such as blood or urine tests"
delirium,"for delirium, symptoms of delirium?","Delirium affects your mind, emotions, movements, and sleep patterns.
You might have a hard time concentrating or feel confused about what�s happening around you. You may also move more slowly or quickly than usual, and experience mood swings.
Other symptoms may include:
not thinking clearly
having trouble speaking clearly or participating in a conversation
being easily distracted
losing track of what time it is and where you are (disorientation)
sleeping poorly or feeling drowsy
sudden changes in your ability to carry out everyday activities, like eating or walking
difficulty remembering recent events
becoming agitated or paranoid
If alcohol withdrawal progresses to delirium, symptoms may include
:
confusion
hallucinations
rapid heart rate
high blood pressure
excessive sweating
dangerously high body temperature
agitation"
delirium,"for delirium, how is delirium diagnosed??","A healthcare professional can diagnose you with delirium. Usually, this is done by a doctor or, in some cases, a nurse.
The clinician will observe your symptoms and examine you to see how you think, speak, and move.
Confusion assessment method
Many health professionals use the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) to diagnose or rule out delirium. This is a screening test that helps them observe whether or not:
your behavior and mental state is fluctuating over time
you have a hard time paying attention or following others as they speak
you have trouble keeping your thoughts organized
you�re experiencing an altered state of alertness
Tests and exams
Many factors can cause changes in brain chemistry and function. Your doctor will try to determine the cause of the delirium by running tests relevant to your symptoms and medical history.
One or more of the following tests may be needed
to check for underlying causes:
blood tests
chest X-ray
urine tests
electrocardiogram (EKG)
bladder imaging
Your doctor may also request other tests, depending on your symptoms."
delirium,"for delirium, how is delirium treated??","Depending on the cause of the delirium, treatment may include taking or stopping certain medications.
In older adults, an accurate diagnosis is important for treatment, as delirium symptoms are similar to dementia, but the treatments are very different.
Medications
Your doctor may prescribe medications to treat the underlying cause of your delirium. For example, if your delirium is caused by a severe asthma attack, you might need an inhaler to restore your breathing.
If a bacterial infection is causing the delirium symptoms, antibiotics may be prescribed.
In some cases, your doctor may recommend that you stop taking certain medications if they are causing delirium.
If you are experiencing substance withdrawal, you may be prescribed medication to manage your symptoms.
Delirium itself is not usually treated with medication. Rather, it is the underlying cause that is being treated. But if you have severe symptoms of hyperactive delirium that do not improve, antipsychotic medications may be considered.
Supportive care
Reducing stress and creating a calm environment can help you recover from delirium. You may find it helpful to:
set a clear daily routine
eat and drink water on a regular schedule
keep clocks and calendars visible to orient yourself
maintain good sleep habits
be physically active in ways that are safe for you
put on your glasses and hearing aids daily, if you use these devices
If you are caring for someone with delirium, do your best to:
speak calmly and use short sentences
reassure them
avoid moving your loved one to an unfamiliar room or place during recovery, if it�s not necessary
share familiar objects, like photos
Counseling
If you�re feeling disoriented, counseling may help to anchor your thoughts.
Counseling is also used as a treatment for people whose delirium was brought on by substance use. In these cases, the treatment can help you abstain from using the substances that brought on the delirium.
In all cases, counseling is intended to make you feel comfortable and give you a safe place to discuss your thoughts and feelings."
delirium,"for delirium, outlook?","Recovering from delirium takes time. It can take weeks or months for you to think, speak, and feel physically like your old self. Sometimes, certain changes may be permanent. The course of recovery is different for everyone.
To reduce the chance of delirium coming back, follow your treatment plan carefully to address underlying causes. Do your best to avoid stress and maintain health-promoting habits, such as eating well, drinking lots of water, and getting quality sleep.
Delirium can often
go unrecognized. If you notice a changed mental state or level of alertness in yourself or your loved one, it�s important to talk with a doctor. Sudden changes may be a sign of a medical emergency."
neutropenia,what is neutropenia? Tell me about neutropenia? What kind of disease is neutropenia? Can you elaborate on neutropenia? What can you tell me about neutropenia? Could you describe what neutropenia is? I�d like to know more about neutropenia. Can you help? What information do you have on neutropenia? Could you provide information on neutropenia?,"Neutropenia is a blood condition characterized by low levels of neutrophils, which are white blood cells that protect your body from infections. This means your body can�t fight off bacteria.
Having neutropenia increases your risk for many types of infection. Read on to learn about the types, causes, and treatments for the condition."
neutropenia,"for neutropenia, types of neutropenia?","There are four types of neutropenia:
Congenital
Congenital neutropenia is present at birth. Severe congenital neutropenia is also called Kostmann syndrome. It causes very low neutrophil levels and in some cases, complete lack of neutrophils. This puts infants and young children at risk for serious infections.
Cyclic
Cyclic neutropenia is present at birth and causes neutrophil counts to vary in a 21-day cycle. A period of neutropenia may last a few days, followed by normal levels for the rest of the cycle. The cycle then begins again.
Autoimmune
With autoimmune neutropenia, your body makes antibodies that fight your neutrophils. These antibodies kill the neutrophils, causing neutropenia.
Autoimmune neutropenia is most common in infants and young children, with the average age of diagnosis between 7 and 9 months
.
Idiopathic
Idiopathic neutropenia develops any time in life and can affect anyone. The cause is unknown."
neutropenia,"for neutropenia, what are the symptoms of neutropenia??","Neutropenia symptoms can range from mild to severe. The lower the level of neutrophils, the more intense the symptoms.
Typical symptoms include:
fever
pneumonia
sinus infections
otitis media (ear infection)
gingivitis (gum inflammation)
omphalitis (navel infection)
skin abscesses
Severe congenital neutropenia can have serious symptoms. The symptoms often include bacterial infections. These infections can grow on the skin and in the digestive and respiratory systems.
The symptoms of cyclic neutropenia recur in 3-week cycles. Infections can increase when neutrophil levels fall.
The symptoms of autoimmune and idiopathic neutropenia include infections. They�re usually not as severe as those in congenital forms."
neutropenia,"for neutropenia, what causes neutropenia??","Neutropenia can be triggered by:
chemotherapy
radiation therapy
the use of certain drugs
Other causes include:
Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, which is an inherited condition affecting many organs and often characterized by bone marrow and pancreatic failure
glycogen-storage disease type 1b, which is a rare inherited disorder that affects blood sugar levels
leukemia
viral illnesses
severe aplastic anemia
Fanconi anemia
conditions that affect bone marrow
infections, both viral and bacterial, including HIV, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and Lyme disease
deficiencies in certain vitamins and minerals, including B12, folic acid, and copper
According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, most people with severe congenital neutropenia have no family history of the condition."
neutropenia,"for neutropenia, who is at risk??","The risk of neutropenia is increased by certain conditions, such as:
cancer
leukemia
a weakened immune system
Chemotherapy and radiation therapy also raise the risk.
Idiopathic neutropenia affects people of all ages, but people over 70 are at higher risk. Men and women are at equal risk."
neutropenia,"for neutropenia, diagnosing neutropenia?","Your doctor can use these tests to diagnose neutropenia:
Complete blood count (CBC). This test measures neutrophil counts. Intermittent CBC tests can help your doctor check for changes in neutrophil count three times per week for 6 weeks.
Antibody blood test. This test checks for autoimmune neutropenia.
Bone marrow aspirate. This procedure tests bone marrow cells.
Bone marrow biopsy. This involves testing a piece of the bony part of bone marrow.
Cytogenetic and molecular testing. This testing helps your healthcare provider study the structures of the cells."
neutropenia,"for neutropenia, treating neutropenia?","Most cases of neutropenia can be treated with granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSF). This is a synthetic copy of the hormone that causes neutrophils to grow in the bone marrow. G-CSF can increase the number of neutrophils.
G-CSF is usually given as a daily subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. The treatment sometimes includes bone marrow transplants. This is usually when leukemia is present or G-CSF doesn�t work.
The following therapies can also treat infections that occur due to the disorder:
antibiotics
anti-inflammatory drugs
corticosteroids
cytokines
glucocorticoids
immunoglobulins
immunosuppressive drugs
white blood cell transfusions
vitamins"
neutropenia,"for neutropenia, outlook?","Neutropenia can last for months or years. It�s called acute when it lasts for fewer than 3 months. When it lasts for a longer time, it�s called chronic.
Lower neutrophil levels can cause dangerous infections. These infections can be life threatening when they�re untreated.
Having severe congenital neutropenia increases your risk for other conditions. According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, about 40 percent of people with congenital neutropenia have decreased bone density. This puts them at a higher risk for osteoporosis.
About 20 percent have leukemia or blood and bone marrow disease in adolescence.
Treatment of neutropenia emphasizes helping you live a normal life. Managing it involves:
annual bone marrow monitoring
monthly CBC tests
emotional support
psychological therapy"
neutropenia,"for neutropenia, can you prevent neutropenia??","No specific prevention for neutropenia is known. However, the National Neutropenia Network advises the following to reduce complications:
Maintain good oral hygiene. Get regular dental exams, and use an antibacterial mouthwash.
Keep vaccinations current.
Get medical care for a fever above 101.3�F (38.5�C).
Wash your hands thoroughly.
Care for cuts and scrapes.
Use antibiotics and antifungals as directed.
Know how to reach your doctor and hospital.
Talk with your doctor before traveling out of the country.
These preventive lifestyle measures can help you to reduce potential complications of neutropenia. Talk with your doctor about any symptoms that arise, and always know how to reach your doctor and hospital."
hyperbilirubinemia,what is hyperbilirubinemia? Tell me about hyperbilirubinemia? What kind of disease is hyperbilirubinemia? Can you elaborate on hyperbilirubinemia? What can you tell me about hyperbilirubinemia? Could you describe what hyperbilirubinemia is? I�d like to know more about hyperbilirubinemia. Can you help? What information do you have on hyperbilirubinemia? Could you provide information on hyperbilirubinemia?,"Many newborns naturally � and temporarily � have elevated blood levels of bilirubin. In adults, high bilirubin may indicate health conditions such as gallstones or liver issues. It may occur with jaundice.
Bilirubin is a yellowish substance in your blood. It forms after red blood cells break down and travel through your liver, gallbladder, and digestive tract before excretion.
The condition of having high bilirubin levels is called hyperbilirubinemia. It�s usually a sign of an underlying condition, so following up with a doctor is essential if test results show you have high bilirubin.
It�s also a common temporary condition in newborns.
Read on to learn more about the symptoms of high bilirubin and what can cause it."
hyperbilirubinemia,"for hyperbilirubinemia, what level of bilirubin is concerning??","Typically, adult bilirubin levels fall between 0.2 and 1.2 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Anything above 1.2 mg/dL is usually considered elevated.
For children ages 15 days to 18 years, healthy bilirubin levels should be less than 1.0 mg/dL.
Understanding what constitutes an elevated value for newborns depends on what condition the doctor is treating. Doctors will usually worry if bilirubin rises a certain amount in 24 hours.
For example, a level of 8 mg/dl may not seem too concerning on day 2 of life, but if the day 1 value was 2 mg/dl, that 6 mg/dl rise can indicate a need for closer monitoring and treatment."
hyperbilirubinemia,"for hyperbilirubinemia, what causes high bilirubin??","Having high bilirubin can be a sign of several conditions. Your doctor will take your symptoms, as well as any other test results, into account to help narrow down a diagnosis.
Gallstones: These develop when substances like cholesterol or bilirubin harden in your gallbladder. Your gallbladder stores bile, a digestive fluid that helps break down fats before they enter your intestines.
Gilbert�s syndrome: This is a genetic liver condition that causes your liver not to process bilirubin properly. This causes the bilirubin to build up in your bloodstream.
Liver dysfunction: This can be any condition that affects the function of your liver and causes bilirubin to build up in your blood. This is a result of your liver losing its ability to remove and process bilirubin from your bloodstream. Examples include cirrhosis, liver cancer, or autoimmune hepatitis.
Hepatitis: This happens when your liver becomes inflamed, often due to a viral infection. When it�s inflamed, your liver can�t easily process bilirubin, leading to a buildup of it in your blood.
Bile duct obstruction: Bile ducts connect your liver to your gallbladder and the opening of your small intestine, called the duodenum. They help to move bile, which contains bilirubin, from your liver and gallbladder into your intestines. Bile can�t be drained adequately if these ducts become inflamed or blocked. This can lead to an increased level of bilirubin.
Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy: This is a temporary condition during the last trimester of pregnancy. It causes bile drainage from your liver to either slow down or stop entirely. This makes it harder for your liver to process bilirubin from your blood, leading to high bilirubin levels.
Hemolytic anemia: This happens when blood cells break down too quickly in your bloodstream. It�s sometimes passed down genetically, but autoimmune conditions, an enlarged spleen, or an infection can also cause it.
Bilirubin levels in newborns
Many babies have high bilirubin a few days after birth, causing newborn jaundice. This temporary condition usually resolves on its own within a few weeks.
It happens because newborns have more red blood cells and break them down more quickly, but their livers are not developed enough to keep up.
Before being born, the pregnant person�s liver helps with this task. A newborn�s liver is only about 1%
as active as an adult�s.
In most cases, higher bilirubin levels will lead to jaundice between 1 and 3 days after birth. Bilirubin levels can peak as high as 18 mg/dL on the fourth or fifth day, and jaundice typically clears up within 2 weeks as the liver matures.
Feeding 8 to 12 times per day helps to promote regular bowel movements, which help to remove bilirubin from the body.
If jaundice occurs within the first 24 hours after birth, or if bilirubin levels are especially high or don�t begin to fall on their own, doctors may intervene with treatments such as:
phototherapy
intravenous immunoglobulin treatment
exchange transfusion"
hyperbilirubinemia,"for hyperbilirubinemia, what are the symptoms of high bilirubin??","If you have high bilirubin, your symptoms will depend on the underlying cause. You can have mildly high bilirubin and have no symptoms at all.
With moderately high bilirubin, you may only have jaundice, which is a yellowish color in your eyes and skin. Jaundice is the main sign of high bilirubin levels.
Other general signs of illnesses that cause high bilirubin can include:
abdominal pain or swelling
chills
fever
chest pain
weakness
lightheadedness
fatigue
nausea
vomiting
unusually dark urine"
hyperbilirubinemia,"for hyperbilirubinemia, why do a bilirubin test??","Bilirubin levels are usually tested by taking a blood sample. A doctor will usually order this to check your liver function if you or your newborn are experiencing symptoms of high bilirubin or jaundice.
In newborns, blood is typically taken from the heel. In some cases, doctors might use blood from the umbilical cord.
For adults, blood is usually taken from one arm. You may need to fast before your blood test.
Two types of bilirubin will be measured: conjugated bilirubin and unconjugated bilirubin. The ratio between these two types of bilirubin will help narrow down the underlying cause of high bilirubin levels.
Sometimes, a urine sample will be used to test bilirubin levels. No bilirubin shouldn�t be present in urine, so any bilirubin found in a urine sample indicates an underlying condition."
hyperbilirubinemia,"for hyperbilirubinemia, frequently asked questions:?","Should I be worried about high bilirubin levels?
In many cases, high bilirubin isn�t a sign of anything that needs immediate treatment.
But if you notice any of the following symptoms, call a doctor or head to urgent care just in case:
intense abdominal pain or tenderness
drowsiness or disorientation
black or bloody stools
vomiting blood
a fever of 101�F (38.3�C) or higher
easy bruising or bleeding
red or purple skin rash
What does it mean when your bilirubin levels are high?
High bilirubin levels often mean that your liver isn�t filtering bilirubin the way it�s supposed to. There are many causes for this in adults. In newborns, the cause is usually newborn jaundice.
Does high bilirubin always mean liver damage?
High bilirubin levels may mean a problem with your liver, but not necessarily. There are causes unrelated to the liver that can raise your bilirubin levels, such as hemolytic anemia."
hyperbilirubinemia,"for hyperbilirubinemia, the bottom line?","High bilirubin levels usually indicate that something is not working as expected in your liver or gallbladder. Some of these conditions aren�t too serious, but monitoring and treating them is essential.
Anyone with jaundice, the main sign of high bilirubin levels, should contact their doctor. If your doctor isn�t immediately sure what�s causing your high bilirubin levels, you may need to return for additional blood, liver function, or other tests."

I�d like to know more about influenza. Can you help? What information do you have on influenza? Could you provide information on influenza?,"Type A influenza is a common infection that can cause widespread flu outbreaks. It can cause fever, body aches, chills, fatigue, and other symptoms.
Influenza � also known as the flu � is a contagious viral infection that attacks your respiratory system.
Influenza viruses that infect humans can be classified into three main groups: A, B, and C. Type A influenza infection can be serious and cause widespread outbreaks and disease.
Common symptoms of type A infection can be confused with other conditions. While in some milder cases the flu can resolve on its own without significant symptoms, severe cases of type A influenza can be life-threatening."
influenza,"for influenza, influenza a symptoms?","Unlike a common cold, the flu typically occurs with a sudden onset of symptoms. Common signs of an influenza infection include:
coughing
runny or stuffy nose
sneezing
sore throat
fever
headache
fatigue
chills
body aches
Sometimes, influenza A symptoms may resolve on their own. However, if symptoms persist for more than a week without improvement, schedule a visit with your doctor.
People who are at high risk for flu complications, such as those who are 65 years old and up or who have weakened immune systems, should seek immediate medical treatment. In rare cases, the flu can be deadly.
Left untreated, the flu can cause:
ear infection
diarrhea
nausea
vomiting
dizziness
abdominal pain
chest pain
asthma attack
pneumonia
bronchitis
cardiac issues"
influenza,"for influenza, influenza a vs. influenza b?","Types A and B influenza are the more common forms of this infection, routinely causing seasonal outbreaks. Type C influenza usually only causes mild respiratory infections.
Type B influenza can be just as severe as type A influenza but is less common throughout the flu season compared to type A.
Humans are the natural host for type B infection. Type B viruses mutate much slower than type A infections and are categorized by strains, but not subtypes. The B virus strains take longer for their genetic makeup to change than influenza A. This drastically reduces the risk of a widespread pandemic due to type B influenza.
Type A influenza can be dangerous and is known to cause outbreaks and increase your risk of disease. Unlike a type B infection, type A viruses are categorized by subtypes and strains. Influenza A mutates faster than influenza B, but both viruses are always changing, creating new strains from one flu season to the next. Past flu vaccinations will not prevent infection from a new strain.
Wild birds are the natural hosts for a type A virus, also called avian flu and bird flu. This infection can also spread to other animals and humans. This, combined with the ability of type A influenza to mutate faster than type B, can cause pandemics."
influenza,"for influenza, diagnosing influenza a?","Before treating your condition, your doctor will need to check for the influenza virus. The preferred test is the rapid molecular assay. In this procedure, your doctor swabs your nose or throat. The test will detect influenza viral RNA within 30 minutes or less.
Results aren�t always accurate, and your doctor may have to make a diagnosis based on your symptoms or other flu tests."
influenza,"for influenza, treatment?","In some cases, influenza A symptoms can clear on their own with ample rest and fluid intake. In other cases, your doctor may prescribe antiviral medication to fight the infection.
Common antiviral prescriptions include:
zanamivir (Relenza)
oseltamivir (Tamiflu)
peramivir (Rapivab)
These medications, known as neuraminidase inhibitors, reduce the ability of the influenza virus to spread from cell to cell, slowing down the infection process.
Though effective, these medications can cause side effects such as nausea and vomiting. If you begin to experience any of these symptoms or if your condition worsens, stop using the prescription and visit your doctor immediately.
A new medication called baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza), created by a Japanese pharmaceutical company, was approved in October 2018 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
. This antiviral drug helps stop the influenza virus from replicating.
Over-the-counter medication therapy can also ease flu symptoms. Be sure to stay hydrated to loosen mucus in your chest and strengthen your immune system.
How long is it contagious?
If you have the flu, you�re contagious from at least a day before you begin to experience symptoms up through five days after your symptoms begin.
In more severe cases, you could be contagious for even longer after you begin experiencing symptoms. This number can fluctuate if your immune system is weak or undeveloped, specifically in cases of children or older adults."
influenza,"for influenza, prevention?","The best way to prevent the flu is through annual vaccinations. Each flu shot protects against three to four
different influenza viruses within that year�s flu season.
Other ways to prevent spreading this disease include:
washing your hands regularly
avoiding large crowds, specifically during a flu outbreak
covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze
staying home if you develop a fever and for at least 24 hours after it goes away"
influenza,"for influenza, outlook?","Type A influenza is a contagious viral infection that can cause life-threatening complications if left untreated. While some cases of this infection can improve without prescribed medication, a visit to your doctor is recommended. If you don�t already have a provider, our Healthline FindCare tool can help you connect to physicians in your area..
Don�t self-diagnose your condition. The flu can resemble the common cold, but may trigger worsening symptoms. If you think you�ve contracted influenza, schedule a visit with your doctor to discuss treatment."

Drug dependence occurs when you need one or more drugs to function. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) used to distinguish between dependence and abuse. Abuse was considered the mild or early phase of inappropriate drug use that led to dependence. People viewed dependence as a more severe problem than abuse.
The APA replaced �dependence� and �abuse� with �substance use disorder� in the 2013 edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). This diagnosis focuses on the disorder involving the use of the substance."
dependence,"for dependence, drug dependence vs. drug addiction?","People sometimes use the terms �addiction� and �dependence� interchangeably. Dependence is not the same as addiction.
Addiction
Addiction can occur without being dependent on drugs.
Addiction may involve:
using drugs despite the consequences
being unable to stop using drugs
neglecting social and work obligations because of drug use
Dependence
It�s possible to be dependent on drugs without being addicted. Dependence can be a bodily response to a substance. This often occurs if you rely on medications to control a chronic medical condition. These conditions may include:
high blood pressure
diabetes
glaucoma
Dependence may involve:
some or all the symptoms of addiction
development of a high tolerance for the substance as your body adapts to the drug, leading to a desire for larger or more frequent doses
physical symptoms of withdrawal when you attempt to stop using the drug"
dependence,"for dependence, how drug abuse can lead to dependence?","The National Institute on Drug Abuse
estimates 22.7 million Americans need help treating a drug or alcohol problem. In some cases, people may take a prescription medication for pain or another medical condition. This kind of use can sometimes develop into a substance use disorder.
The following are known triggers for substance use disorders:
having a family history of addiction
living in an environment where illegal drugs are often used and easy to access
having a history of anxiety
having a history of depression
having a history of other mental health conditions
Drug users typically pass through certain stages on the way to drug dependence. One way that healthcare providers describe these stages is with the Jellinek Curve. The curve tracks typical stages experienced through occasional use, dependence, disorder, and rehabilitation.
These stages include:
You use drugs for recreation. You take them infrequently and in social settings.
You start using drugs on a regular basis, often abandoning family and friends in favor of drug use. You become concerned about losing access to drugs.
You become addicted to drugs as you become more tolerant to their effects and preoccupied with getting them. You may abandon most or all your previous interests and relationships.
You become dependent on drugs and unable to live without them. Your physical and mental health deteriorates."
dependence,"for dependence, recognizing the symptoms of drug dependence?","You can often determine if an addiction has turned into dependence by looking at behavior. When a person addicted to drugs hasn�t had them for a period of time, this can cause a physical reaction. Physical symptoms of withdrawal occur when the body becomes stressed without the drug. These symptoms include:
anxiety
depression
muscle weakness
nightmares
body aches
sweating
nausea
vomiting"
dependence,"for dependence, treating drug dependence?","When drug abuse escalates to dependence, treatment becomes complicated. You must stop using the drug, but doing so abruptly can cause physical symptoms. You may need the help of a healthcare provider to rid your body of the substance. This can be done on an inpatient or outpatient basis.
Substances that mimic the effects of illegal drugs may help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal during treatment. Detox programs use a combination of therapy and medical treatment to ease dependence and treat the disorder. Ongoing therapy sessions may be needed after you�re released from a treatment program.
Extreme cases of intoxication, withdrawal, or overdose may need emergency care before addiction and dependence can be treated."
dependence,"for dependence, long-term outlook for people with drug dependence?","If left untreated, dependence on illicit drugs can be dangerous. You may increase your drug use as your body adapts to the drugs. This can result in overdose or death.
Treatment can reverse dependence, but you must want to be treated. Sometimes, treatment is successful the first time, but relapse is common. Ongoing therapy and support groups can help you recover, stay on track, and address symptoms of relapse."

I�d like to know more about thrombus. Can you help? What information do you have on thrombus? Could you provide information on thrombus?,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a serious condition in which a blood clot forms in a deep vein inside your body. A blood clot is a clump of blood that�s turned into a solid state.
Deep vein blood clots typically form in your thigh or lower leg, but they can also develop in other areas of your body.
Other names associated with this condition may include:"
thrombus,"for thrombus, dvt symptoms?","According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
, symptoms of DVT only occur in about half of the people with this condition.
Common DVT symptoms include:
swelling in your foot, ankle, or leg, usually on one side
cramping pain in your affected leg that usually begins in your calf
severe, unexplained pain in your foot and ankle
an area of skin that feels warmer than the skin in the surrounding areas
the skin over the affected area turning pale or reddish, or bluish color, depending on skin tone
People with an upper extremity DVT, or a blood clot in the arm, may not experience symptoms. If they do, common symptoms include:
neck pain
shoulder pain
swelling in the arm or hand
blue- or darker-tinted skin color
pain that moves from the arm to the forearm
weakness in the hand
People may not find out they have DVT until they�ve undergone emergency treatment for a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung).
A pulmonary embolism can happen when a DVT clot has moved from the arm or leg into the lung. When an artery in the lung becomes blocked, it�s life threatening and requires emergency care.
Design by Diego Sabogal"
thrombus,"for thrombus, causes and risk factors?","DVT is caused by a blood clot. The clot blocks a vein, preventing
blood from properly circulating in your body.
Different factors can lead to a DVT or increase the risk of developing it. They include:
Injury: Damage to a blood vessel�s wall can narrow or block blood flow. A blood clot may form as a result.
Surgery: Blood vessels can be damaged during surgery, leading to the development of a blood clot. Bed rest with little to no movement after surgery may also increase your risk of developing a blood clot.
Reduced mobility or inactivity: When you sit frequently, such as during a long flight, blood can collect in your legs, especially the lower parts. If you cannot move for extended periods, the blood flow in your legs can slow down. This can cause a clot to develop.
Certain medications: Some medications increase the chances your blood will form a clot. These include birth control pills, hormone therapy drugs, glucocorticoids, and antidepressants.
Age: DVT can still happen at any age, but the incidence rises in older ages. Only 1 in 10,000 people younger than age 20 get DVT, but among those older than age 80, it is 1 in 100.
Trauma: Having an injury that damages your veins, like a bone fracture, can cause a blood clot to develop.
Obesity. Being overweight can put more pressure on your legs and pelvis veins.
Pregnancy: Pregnancy increases the risk
of DVT. In fact, pregnant people are 5-10 times more likely
to develop DVT than those who aren�t pregnant.
Family history: Having relatives who have had DVT may make you more likely to get it.
Catheter: Having a catheter placed in a vein can increase the likelihood of a blood clot forming.
Smoking: This is associated with a higher risk of DVT.
Hereditary blood clotting disorders: Having a clotting disorder makes you more susceptible to DVT.
Cancer: Having pancreatic, lung, stomach, or brain cancer, as well as other cancers, puts you at risk
of DVT, especially if you�re undergoing chemotherapy.
In addition, several other health conditions can increase the risk for DVT. These include
inflammatory bowel disease
cardiac problems like high blood pressure and heart failure
sepsis
Covid-19, tuberculosis, and other viral or bacterial illnesses
asthma
sleep apnea
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
diabetes"
thrombus,"for thrombus, complications?","A major complication of DVT is a pulmonary embolism. You can develop a pulmonary embolism if a blood clot moves to your lungs and blocks a blood vessel.
This can cause serious damage to your lungs and other parts of your body. Get immediate medical help if you have signs of a pulmonary embolism. These signs include:
dizziness
sweating
chest pain that gets worse with coughing or inhaling deeply
rapid breathing
coughing up blood
rapid heart rate"
thrombus,"for thrombus, treatment?","DVT is a serious medical condition. Tell your doctor immediately if you think you�re experiencing symptoms of DVT, or go to the closest emergency room. A healthcare professional can check out your symptoms.
DVT treatments focus on keeping the clot from growing. In addition, treatment may help prevent a pulmonary embolism and lower your risk of having more clots.
Medications
Your doctor might prescribe medications to thin your blood. The preferred
treatment is with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as rivaroxaban (Xarelto) or apixaban (Eliquis).
Other drugs a doctor may use include:
heparin
warfarin (Coumadin)
enoxaparin (Lovenox)
fondaparinux (Arixtra)
Blood-thinning medications make it harder for your blood to clot. They also keep
existing clots as small as possible and decrease the chance that you�ll develop more clots.
If blood thinners don�t work or the DVT is severe, your doctor might use thrombolytic drugs. People with upper extremity DVT may also benefit
from this medication.
Thrombolytic drugs work by breaking up clots. You�ll receive these intravenously (through a vein).
Compression stockings
If you�re at high risk of DVT, wearing compression stockings can prevent swelling and might lower your chance of developing clots.
Compression stockings reach just below your knee or right above it. Your doctor may recommend you wear these every day.
Filters
If you cannot take blood thinners, you might need a filter inside the large abdominal vein called the vena cava. This treatment helps prevent pulmonary embolisms by stopping clots from entering your lungs.
Filters do have risks. If they�re left in for too long, they can actually increase
the risk of DVT. Filters should be used for a short-term period until the risk of thromboembolism is reduced, and blood thinners can be used.
Surgery
Your doctor may suggest surgery to remove a DVT clot in your arm or leg. This is typically only recommended with very large blood clots or clots that cause serious issues, like tissue damage.
During a surgical thrombectomy or surgery to remove a blood clot, your surgeon will make an incision into a blood vessel. They�ll locate and remove the clot. Then, they�ll repair the blood vessel and tissue.
In some cases, they may use a small inflating balloon to keep the blood vessel open while they remove the clot. When the clot is found and removed, the balloon is removed with it.
Surgery isn�t without risks, so many doctors will recommend it only in severe cases. Risks include:
infection
damage to the blood vessel
excess bleeding
Home remedies
Once a DVT blood clot is diagnosed, your doctor will likely prescribe medication to help thin the blood or break up the clot.
You can combine the prescribed medication with home remedies to prevent
other complications and reduce the risk of future blood clots.
Move more
If possible, take daily walks to improve blood flow. Shorter, frequent walks are better than one long walk.
Keep your leg or arm elevated
This is especially important for the legs. Blood can pool if your feet are on the ground all day. Use a stool or chair to keep your legs elevated and close to level with your hips.
Wear compression stockings
These specially designed stockings fit tightly around your feet and become gradually looser as they move up your leg to your knee. The compression helps prevent pooling and swelling, and it increases blood flow.
Most people don�t need them, but people at high risk of DVT may find them useful. Compression stockings may be beneficial when you�re traveling.
Eat healthfully
Eating a nutrient-dense and balanced diet is important for helping to avoid life threatening complications.
A diet high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables, such as the Mediterranean diet, may be best for people at risk of DVT or those who�ve had DVT before, but research is needed to support this.
Some vitamins and minerals can interfere with DVT medications. For example, too much vitamin K can bypass warfarin�s ability to thin your blood and prevent a clot.
Review any vitamins or supplements you take with your doctor, and ask about possible medication interactions. It�s also important you talk with your doctor about any foods or nutrients you should avoid."
thrombus,"for thrombus, prevention?","A healthy lifestyle incorporates many necessary changes to prevent blood clots from forming. This includes moving more, quitting smoking, and maintaining a moderate weight.
You can also lower your risk of having DVT by:
managing your blood pressure
giving up smoking
maintaining a moderate weight
Take any blood thinners your doctor prescribes if you�re having surgery, which can lower your chance of developing clots afterward.
The risk of developing DVT during travel becomes higher if you sit for more than 4 hours.
Moving your legs around when you�ve been sitting for a while also helps keep your blood flowing. Walking around after being on bed rest can prevent clots from forming.
Get out of your car during long drives and stretch at regular intervals. Walk in the aisles if you�re flying, taking a train, or riding a bus.
Stretch your legs and feet while you�re sitting. This keeps your blood moving steadily in your calves. Don�t wear tight clothes that can restrict blood flow. Complications of DVT are preventable.
Exercises for DVT
If you have to be seated for long periods, such as on a long flight, you can exercise to keep your legs moving and help circulate blood.
Knee pulls
Bend your leg, and raise your knee toward your chest. Wrap your knee with your arms for a greater stretch. Hold this position for several seconds, then do the same exercise on the other side.
Repeat these stretches several times.

thrombus,"for thrombus, diagnosis?","Your doctor will use your medical history, a thorough physical exam, and one or more diagnostic tests to find or rule out DVT. These tests include:
Ultrasound
This is the most commonly used test for diagnosing DVT. Ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of your arteries and veins to see how blood flows through them.
If a clot is present, your doctor can see the interrupted blood flow and make the diagnosis.
Venogram
If the ultrasound is inconclusive, your doctor may order a venogram. During this test, a dye is injected into the vein in question. Then, an X-ray is taken over the area where your doctor suspects DVT is present.
The dye makes the vein more visible so that interrupted blood flow would be easily seen.
D-dimer test
A D-dimer blood test measures the presence of a substance released when a blood clot breaks apart.
If levels of the substance are high and you have risk factors for DVT, you likely have a clot. If levels are healthy and your risk factors are low, you likely don�t.
A D-dimer blood test can also indicate other factors, such as a pulmonary embolism, stroke, pregnancy, or infection, so your doctor may need to use other tests to be sure of a diagnosis.
Other tests can be used to diagnose DVT if these are not successful."
thrombus,"for thrombus, takeaway?","DVT is a serious condition that could be life threatening. Diagnosis can often be difficult, as many people with DVT do not experience symptoms.
If you don�t experience symptoms, you may even be at a greater risk for life threatening complications.
This is why it�s important to know the risk factors and share any symptoms with your doctor. They may prescribe medication or other therapies to help you treat DVT, but there are many things you can do on your own.
Moving regularly, wearing compression stockings, and adopting a balanced diet are key ways to manage DVT risk."
cholecystitis,what is cholecystitis? Tell me about cholecystitis? What kind of disease is cholecystitis? Can you elaborate on cholecystitis? What can you tell me about cholecystitis? Could you describe what cholecystitis is? I�d like to know more about cholecystitis. Can you help? What information do you have on cholecystitis? Could you provide information on cholecystitis?,"What is chronic cholecystitis?
Cholecystitis is the sudden inflammation of your gallbladder. If this condition persists over time, such as for months, with repeated attacks, or if there are recurrent problems with gallbladder function, it�s known as chronic cholecystitis.
The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ located on the underside of your liver. It stores bile made by the liver and sends it to the small intestine via the common bile duct (CBD) to aid in the digestion of fats. The CBD connects the liver, the gallbladder, and the pancreas to the small intestine. Gallstones blocking the CBD are the leading cause of cholecystitis. This blockage causes bile to build up in the gallbladder, and that buildup causes the gallbladder to become inflamed.
If this happens acutely in the face of chronic inflammation, it is a serious condition. The gallbladder could rupture if it�s not treated properly, and this is considered a medical emergency. Treatment usually involves antibiotics, pain medications, and removal of the gallbladder."
cholecystitis,"for cholecystitis, what causes chronic cholecystitis??","This condition usually begins with the formation of gallstones in the gallbladder. According to the Cleveland Clinic, whether you have gallstones may depend on several factors, including:
genetic predisposition
weight
gallbladder activity
dietary habits
Gallstones form when substances in the bile form crystal-like particles. They can range from the size of a grain of sand to the size of a golf ball. The presence of gallstones causes pressure, irritation, and may cause infection. The walls of the gallbladder begin to thicken over time. Eventually, the gallbladder starts to shrink. These changes make it harder for the gallbladder to function properly.
In addition to gallstones, cholecystitis can be due to:
infection of the CBD drainage system
a CBD blockage
excess cholesterol in the gallbladder, which can happen during pregnancy or after rapid weight loss
decreased blood supply to the gallbladder because of diabetes
tumors in the liver or pancreas
tumors in the gallbladder, which is rare
When you experience repeated or prolonged attacks of cholecystitis, it becomes a chronic condition."
cholecystitis,"for cholecystitis, who gets cholecystitis??","A number of factors increase your chances of getting cholecystitis:
Gallstones are more common in women than in men. This makes women more likely than men to develop cholecystitis.
The changing of hormones can often cause it. Pregnant women or people on hormone therapy are at greater risk.
The Cleveland Clinic states that the risk of developing this condition increases after age 40.
Hispanics and Native Americans have a higher risk of developing gallstones than other people.
People who are obese are also more likely to get this condition.
Rapid weight loss or weight gain can bring upon the disorder.
If you have diabetes, you are at risk of getting cholecystitis."
cholecystitis,"for cholecystitis, symptoms of cholecystitis?","Symptoms of cholecystitis can appear suddenly or develop slowly over a period of years. Most of the time these symptoms appear after a meal that is high in fat.
Symptoms include:
severe abdominal pains that may feel sharp or dull
abdominal cramping and bloating
pain that spreads to your back or below your right shoulder blade
fever
chills
nausea
vomiting
loose, light-colored stools
jaundice, which is when your skin and the whites of your eyes turn yellow
itching
A typical attack can last two or three days, but symptoms of cholecystitis vary widely from person to person. The symptoms appear on the right or middle upper part of your stomach. The pain will usually last for 30 minutes.
Complications can include:
pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas
perforation of the gallbladder as a result of infection
enlarged gallbladder due to inflammation
infection may cause the bile to build up
cancer of the gallbladder (this is a rare, long-term complication)
death of gallbladder tissue (this can lead to a tear and ultimately a burst of the organ)
The symptoms of cholecystitis can be treated at home with pain medication and rest, if you have been properly diagnosed. It�s important that you talk to your doctor first before making the decision to treat at home. You may also take antibiotics and avoid fatty foods.
You should always seek medical attention if you are getting severe pains in your abdomen or if your fever does not break."
cholecystitis,"for cholecystitis, how cholecystitis is diagnosed?","Your doctor will take your medical history and conduct a physical exam. The symptoms of cholecystitis are similar to those of other conditions, so they must rule out those conditions.
There are tests that can help diagnose cholecystitis:
The CT scan uses X-rays to produce very detailed pictures of your abdomen. This is the most sensitive test, and is likely the best bet in locating the problem.
Your doctor may use an abdominal ultrasound to view your gallbladder and liver. This will help them visualize stones and duct obstructions.
Blood tests can identify infections in the bloodstream.
In cholescintigraphy, or a HIDA scan, an injection of a small amount of radioactive material can help identify abnormal contractions or obstructions of your gallbladder and bile ducts. This is also an accurate method of locating the problem. It can take anywhere from an hour to four hours to get your results back.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography involves using an endoscope (a long, flexible tube inserted down your throat), dye, and an X-ray to thoroughly examine your organs and find defects or problems.
In a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, your doctor will insert contrast dye into your liver with a needle. This allows your doctor to see your bile ducts on X-ray."
cholecystitis,"for cholecystitis, treatment options for cholecystitis?","The specific cause of your attack will determine the course of treatment. Your doctor will also consider your overall health when choosing your treatment. The options include:
broad-spectrum antibiotics for fighting infection
oral dissolution therapy using medications to help dissolve gallstones (this is typically a last resort, reserved for individuals who cannot undergo surgery)
pain relievers for controlling pain during treatment
Surgery is often the course of action in cases of chronic cholecystitis. Today, gallbladder surgery is generally done laparoscopically. Your surgeon will make small incisions in your abdomen and insert small surgical tools to perform the surgery. In most cases, the surgery is an outpatient procedure, which means a shorter recovery time.
Your healthcare team will advise you about lifestyle and dietary guidelines that can also improve your condition.
Lifestyle and diet changes
Having cholecystitis means you should make important changes to your diet. Upon recovery, eating five to six smaller meals a day is recommended. This allows the bile in your digestive tract to normalize. One big meal can throw off the system and produce a spasm in the gallbladder and bile ducts.
Stick to a low-fat diet with lean proteins, such as poultry or fish. Avoid fatty meats, fried food, and any high-fat foods, including whole milk products."
cholecystitis,"for cholecystitis, long-term outlook for chronic cholecystitis?","When treated properly, the long-term outlook is quite good. You don�t need a gallbladder to live or to digest food. Without your gallbladder, bile will flow directly from your liver into your small intestine."
cholecystitis,"for cholecystitis, can chronic cholecystitis be prevented??","If you�ve had one or more bouts of cholecystitis, speak to your doctor to learn about changes you can make to avoid chronic cholecystitis. Ask about dietary guidelines that may include reducing how much fat you eat. Regular exercise is often helpful.
Gallstones are the main cause of cholecystitis. You can lower your risk of developing more gallstones by maintaining a healthy weight. If you need to lose weight, try to do it slowly because rapid weight loss can increase your risk of developing gallstones."
cholecystitis,"for cholecystitis, recovery time?","Q:
How long does it usually take for a full recovery from chronic cholecystitis surgery and what are some things a person should keep in mind during the recovery period?
Anonymous patient
A:
Recovery from gallbladder surgery depends upon the type of surgery you have. Individuals who undergo the laparoscopic procedure will recover faster than those who have traditional surgery, where an abdominal incision is made. Regardless of the type of surgery you have, recovery guidelines can be similar, and expect at least six weeks for full healing. Always follow your surgeon�s specific recommendations. Common care instructions include:
� avoid lifting greater than 10 pounds
� eat a low-fat diet with small frequent meals
� expect fatigue, so get plenty of rest
� stay hydrated
� monitor all surgical wounds for redness, drainage, or increased pain

Could you describe what hernia hiatal is? I�d like to know more about hernia hiatal. Can you help? What information do you have on hernia hiatal? Could you provide information on hernia hiatal?,"A hiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of your stomach pushes up through your diaphragm and into your chest region. Hiatal hernias don�t always cause symptoms. Hiatal hernia symptoms may include heartburn, acid reflux, and chest pain."
hernia hiatal,"for hernia hiatal, what is a hiatal hernia??","A hiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of your stomach pushes up through your diaphragm and into your chest region.
The diaphragm is a large muscle that lies between your abdomen and chest. You use this muscle to help you breathe. Normally, your stomach is below the diaphragm, but in people with a hiatal hernia, a portion of the stomach pushes up through the muscle. The opening it moves through is called a hiatus."
hernia hiatal,"for hernia hiatal, types of hiatal hernia?","There are generally two types
of hiatal hernia: sliding hiatal hernias and fixed, or paraesophageal, hernias.
Sliding hiatal hernia
This is the more common type of hiatal hernia. It occurs when your stomach and esophagus slide into and out of your chest through the hiatus. Sliding hernias tend to be small. They usually don�t cause any symptoms, and may not require treatment.
Fixed hiatal hernia
This type of hernia is not as common
. It�s also known as a paraesophageal hernia.
In a fixed hernia, part of your stomach pushes through your diaphragm and stays there. Most cases are not serious. But there�s a risk that blood flow to your stomach could become blocked. If that happens, it could cause serious damage and is considered a medical emergency."
hernia hiatal,"for hernia hiatal, symptoms of a hiatal hernia?","It�s rare for even fixed hiatal hernias to cause symptoms. If you do experience any symptoms, they�re usually caused by stomach acid, bile, or air entering your esophagus. Common symptoms include:
heartburn that gets worse when you lean over or lie down
acid reflux or GERD
chest pain or epigastric pain
trouble swallowing
belching"
hernia hiatal,"for hernia hiatal, surgery for a hiatal hernia?","Surgical treatment is sometimes required to repair larger hiatal hernias and treat heartburn symptoms. Surgery for Hiatal hernias is used if reflux symptoms can not be successfully controlled with medication or if you have a type of hernia called a giant esophageal hernia, also known as intrathoracic stomach.
Types of surgery
While hiatal hernias can often be treated with lifestyle changes or medication, some people may need surgery to repair their hiatal hernias.
Surgery to repair a hiatal hernia may involve tightening your diaphragm and pulling the stomach down from the chest cavity back into the abdomen.
A surgeon will recommend surgery based on what stage your hiatal hernia is.
Common surgical options include
:
Hiatus repair surgery. This surgery uses sutures and prosthetic mesh to tighten and decrease the size of the enlarged hiatus, which is the opening in the diaphragm that the esophagus travels through on its way to the stomach. It prevents your stomach from bulging upward through the hiatus and is used for early-stage Hiatal hernias.
Nissen Fundoplication. This procedure involves using stitches to wrap the upper part of the stomach, called the fundus, around the bottom portion of the esophagus in order to hold the stomach in place below the diaphragmatic hiatus. The stitches create pressure at the end of your esophagus which prevents stomach acid and food from flowing up from the stomach.
Collis-Nissen gastroplasty. This surgery is used to lengthen the esophagus in patients with more complex forms of Hiatal hernia due to esophageal shortening. In this procedure, a surgeon will use tissue from the upper part of your stomach to extend your esophagus.
What to expect
Surgery to repair a hiatal hernia typically takes between 2 and 3 hours
and is done while you�re under general anesthesia, so you�ll fall asleep and not feel pain during the procedure.
Surgery to repair a hiatal hernia can be done using different techniques:
Open repair. In an open repair surgery, your surgeon will make a large surgical cut in your belly in order to perform surgery.
Laparoscopic repair. In laparoscopic surgery, your surgeon will make several small cuts in your belly and insert a thin tube with a small camera through one of the cuts. Surgical tools will be inserted through the other cuts. Your surgeon will use a monitor hooked up to the camera in order to view the inside of your stomach and perform the surgery.
Recovery
You can expect to stay in the hospital for 1 to 2 days after your surgery. Some surgeries may require you to follow a soft or liquid diet and avoid carbonated beverages for a couple of weeks after surgery.
You may find that your appetite has decreased following surgery, and some patients may experience diarrhea during the first few days after their hernia repair.
There are generally no significant restrictions after hiatal hernia repair surgery, which means it�s ok to walk, climb stairs, have sexual intercourse, or exercise as long as it doesn�t hurt.
Your surgeon or doctor will provide more specific guidelines and instructions for your recovery, depending on what type of surgery you have."
hernia hiatal,"for hernia hiatal, treatment options for hiatal hernias?","Most cases of hiatal hernia don�t require treatment. The presence of symptoms usually determines treatment. If you have acid reflux and heartburn, you may be treated with medications or, if those don�t work, surgery.
Medications
Medications your doctor may prescribe include:
over-the-counter (OTC) antacids to neutralize stomach acid
OTC or prescription H2-receptor blockers that lower acid production
OTC or prescription proton pump inhibitors to prevent acid production, giving your esophagus time to heal
Diet
Hiatal hernia causes
acid reflux symptoms. Changing your diet can reduce your symptoms. It may help to eat smaller meals several times a day instead of three large meals. You should also avoid eating meals or snacks within a few hours of going to bed.
There are also certain foods that may increase your risk of heartburn. Consider avoiding
:
spicy foods
chocolate
foods made with tomatoes
caffeine
onions
citrus fruits
alcohol
Other ways to reduce your symptoms include:
stopping smoking
raising the head of your bed by at least 6 inches
avoiding bending over or lying down after eating"
hernia hiatal,"for hernia hiatal, causes and risk factors for hiatal hernias?","The exact cause of many hiatal hernias is not known. In some people, injury or other damage may weaken muscle tissue. This makes it possible for your stomach to push through your diaphragm.
Another cause is putting too much pressure (repeatedly) on the muscles around your stomach. This can happen when:
coughing
vomiting
straining during bowel movements
lifting heavy objects
Some people are also born with an abnormally large hiatus. This makes it easier for the stomach to move through it.
Factors that can increase your risk of a hiatal hernia include:
obesity
aging
smoking
You may not avoid a hiatal hernia entirely, but you can avoid making a hernia worse by:
losing excess weight
not straining during bowel movements
getting help when lifting heavy objects
avoiding tight belts and certain abdominal exercises"
hernia hiatal,"for hernia hiatal, testing for and diagnosing hiatal hernias?","Several tests
can diagnose a hiatal hernia.
Barium swallow
Your doctor may have you drink a liquid with barium in it before taking an X-ray. This X-ray provides a clear silhouette of your upper digestive tract. The image allows your doctor to see the location of your stomach. If it�s protruding through your diaphragm, you have a hiatal hernia.
Endoscopy
Your doctor may perform an endoscopy. They�ll slide a thin tube in your throat and pass it down to your esophagus and stomach. Your doctor will then be able to see if your stomach is pushing through your diaphragm. Any strangulation or obstruction will also be visible."
hernia hiatal,"for hernia hiatal, prevention of hiatal hernias?","Doctors don�t know exactly what causes hiatal hernias or how to prevent them from happening.
But certain factors like living with obesity and smoking may increase your risk of a hiatial hernia, so maintaining a moderate weight and quitting smoking may help decrease your risk of developing one."
hernia hiatal,"for hernia hiatal, medical emergencies?","An obstruction or a strangulated hernia may block blood flow to your stomach. This is considered a medical emergency. Call your doctor right away if:
you feel nauseated
you�ve been vomiting

Don�t assume that a hiatal hernia is causing your chest pain or discomfort. It could also be a sign of heart problems or peptic ulcers. It�s important to see your doctor. Only testing can find out what�s causing your symptoms."
hernia hiatal,"for hernia hiatal, what is the connection between gerd and hiatal hernias??","Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurs when the food, liquids, and acid in your stomach end up in your esophagus. This can lead to heartburn or nausea after meals. It�s common for people with a hiatal hernia to have GERD. However, that doesn�t mean either condition always causes the other. You can have a hiatal hernia without GERD or GERD without a hernia."
hernia hiatal,"for hernia hiatal, outlook?","Many people with hiatal hernias have no symptoms and do not need medical care. But for people with more severe hernias, treatment with medication, lifestyle changes, and, in some cases, surgery may be needed to repair the hernia and provide relief from uncomfortable symptoms like heartburn and chest pain.
It�s possible for a hiatal hernia to recur after surgery. In a 2020 study, the recurrence rate for patients who underwent a minimally invasive fundoplication surgery was 18 percent.
Lifestyle changes like losing weight and maintaining a healthy weight, quitting smoking, eating smaller portions of food, limiting certain fatty and acidic foods, and eating meals a least 3 to 4 hours before lying down can help you manage the symptoms of hiatal hernia."
migraine disorders,what is migraine disorders? Tell me about migraine disorders? What kind of disease is migraine disorders? Can you elaborate on migraine disorders? What can you tell me about migraine disorders? Could you describe what migraine disorders is? I�d like to know more about migraine disorders. Can you help? What information do you have on migraine disorders? Could you provide information on migraine disorders?,"Migraine is a neurological condition that typically causes painful headache attacks that occur with additional symptoms, such as sensitivity to light, sound, smell, or touch.
More than just the cause of �really bad headaches,� migraine is a neurological condition that can cause multiple symptoms. While intense, debilitating headaches frequently characterize it, additional symptoms may include:
The condition often runs in families and can affect all ages. People assigned female at birth are more likely than people assigned male at birth to be diagnosed with migraine.
The diagnosis of migraine is determined based on clinical history, reported symptoms, and by ruling out other causes. The most common categories of migraine headaches (or attacks) are episodic versus chronic, and then those without aura and those with aura."
migraine disorders,"for migraine disorders, what does migraine feel like??","People describe migraine pain as:
pulsating
throbbing
perforating
pounding
debilitating
It can also feel like a severe, dull, steady ache. The pain may start out as mild. But without treatment, it can become moderate to severe.
Migraine pain most commonly affects the forehead area. It�s usually on one side of the head, but it can occur on both sides or shift.
Most migraine attacks last about 4 hours. If they�re not treated or don�t respond to treatment, they can last for as long as 72 hours to a week. In migraine with aura, pain may overlap with an aura or may never occur at all."
migraine disorders,"for migraine disorders, migraine symptoms?","Migraine symptoms may begin 1 to 2 days before the headache itself. This is known as the prodrome stage. Symptoms during this stage can include:
food cravings
depression
fatigue or low energy
frequent yawning
hyperactivity
irritability
neck stiffness
In migraine with aura, the aura occurs after the prodrome stage. During an aura, you may have problems with your vision, sensation, movement, and speech. Examples of these problems include:
difficulty speaking clearly
feeling a prickling or tingling sensation in your face, arms, or legs
seeing shapes, light flashes, or bright spots
temporarily losing your vision
The next phase is known as the attack phase. This is the most acute or severe of the phases when the actual migraine pain occurs. In some people, this can overlap or occur during an aura. Attack phase symptoms can last anywhere from hours to days. Symptoms of migraine can vary from person to person.
Some symptoms may include:
increased sensitivity to light and sound
nausea
dizziness or feeling faint
pain on one side of your head, either on the left side, right side, front, or back, or in your temples
pulsing and throbbing head pain
vomiting
After the attack phase, a person will often experience the postdrome phase. During this phase, there are usually changes in mood and feelings. These can range from feeling euphoric and extremely happy to feeling very fatigued and apathetic. A mild, dull headache may persist.
The length and intensity of these phases can occur to different degrees in different people. Sometimes, a phase gets skipped, and a migraine attack may occur without causing a headache."
migraine disorders,"for migraine disorders, what causes migraine attacks??","Researchers haven�t identified a definitive cause for migraine. But they still believe the condition is due to �abnormal� brain activity that affects nerve signaling, and chemicals and blood vessels in the brain.
There are also many migraine triggers that are continually reported, including:
bright lights
severe heat, or other extremes in weather
dehydration
changes in barometric pressure
hormone changes in people assigned female at birth, like estrogen and progesterone fluctuations during menstruation, pregnancy, or menopause
excess stress
loud sounds
intense physical activity
skipping meals
changes in sleep patterns
use of certain medications, like oral contraceptives or nitroglycerin
unusual smells
certain foods
smoking
alcohol use
traveling
If you experience a migraine attack, your doctor may ask you to keep a headache journal. Writing down what you were doing, what foods you ate, and what medications you took before your migraine attack began can help identify your triggers."
migraine disorders,"for migraine disorders, migraine treatment?","Migraine can�t be cured, but your doctor can help you manage migraine attacks by giving you the tools to treat symptoms when they occur, which may lead to fewer attacks in general. Treatment can also help make migraine less severe.
Your treatment plan depends on:
your age
how often you have migraines attacks
the type of migraine you have
how severe they are � based on how long they last, how much pain you have, and how often they keep you from going to school or work
whether they include nausea or vomiting, as well as other symptoms
other health conditions you may have and other medications you may take
Your treatment plan may include a combination of:
lifestyle adjustments, including stress management and avoiding migraine triggers
OTC pain or migraine medications, like Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen (Tylenol)
prescription migraine medications that you take every day to help prevent migraine headaches and reduce how often you have headaches
prescription migraine medications that you take as soon as an attack starts to keep it from becoming severe and to ease symptoms
prescription medications to help with nausea or vomiting
hormone therapy if migraines seem to occur in relation to your menstrual cycle
counseling
alternative care, which may include meditation, acupressure, or acupuncture
If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here.
Medication
Medications can be used to either prevent a migraine attack from happening or treat it once it occurs. You may be able to get relief with OTC medication. But if OTC medications aren�t effective, your doctor may decide to prescribe other medications.
The severity of your migraine and any other health conditions you have will determine which treatment is right for you.
Acute medications � taken as soon as you suspect a migraine attack is coming � include:
NSAIDs: These medications, like ibuprofen or aspirin, are typically used in mild-to-moderate attacks that don�t include nausea or vomiting.
Triptans: These medications, like sumatriptan, eletriptan, and rizatriptan, are typically the first line of defense for individuals who have nerve pain as a symptom of their migraine attacks.
Antiemetics: These medications, like metoclopramide, chlorpromazine, and prochlorperazine, are typically used with NSAIDs to help decrease nausea.
Ergot alkaloids: These medications, like Migranal and Ergomar, aren�t prescribed that often and are usually reserved for individuals who don�t respond to triptans or analgesics.
Preventative medications � prescribed to people whose migraine attacks can be debilitating or happen more than four times a month � are taken once a day, or every 3 months via injection. These medications include:
Antihypertensives: These drugs are prescribed for high blood pressure and can also help with migraine attacks. Beta-blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers (candesartan) are some examples of antihypertensive drugs used for migraine prevention.
Anticonvulsants: Certain anti-seizure medications may also be able to prevent migraine attacks.
Antidepressants: Some antidepressants, like amitriptyline and venlafaxine, may also be able to prevent migraine attacks.
Botox: Botox injections are administered to the head and neck muscles every 3 months.
Calcitonin gene-related peptide treatments: These treatments are administered either via injection or through an IV and work to prevent a migraine attack from developing."
migraine disorders,"for migraine disorders, migraine triggers?","While migraine attack triggers can be very personal, certain foods or food ingredients may be more likely to trigger an attack than others. These may include:
alcohol or caffeinated drinks
food additives, like nitrates (a preservative in cured meats), aspartame (an artificial sugar), or monosodium glutamate (MSG)
tyramine, which occurs naturally in some foods
Tyramine also increases when foods are fermented or aged. These include foods like some aged cheeses, sauerkraut, and soy sauce. But ongoing research is looking more closely at the role of tyramine in migraines, as it may not be as big of a trigger as previously thought.
Other migraine attack triggers can be varied and seem random:
hormone triggers in people assigned female at birth
stress
anxiety
excitement
poor sleep quality
strenuous exercise (if you don�t do it often)
bright lights
changes in climate
hormone replacement therapy drugs
Keeping a journal of when your migraine attacks occur can help you identify your personal triggers."
migraine disorders,"for migraine disorders, migraine types?","There are many types of migraine. Two of the most common types are migraine without aura and migraine with aura. Some people have both types.
Many people living with migraine have more than one type of migraine.
Migraine without aura
Most people with migraine don�t experience an aura with their headaches.
Individuals who have migraine without an aura have had at least five attacks that have these characteristics
:
attack usually lasts 4 to 72 hours without treatment or if treatment doesn�t work
attack has at least two of these traits:
it occurs only on one side of the head (unilateral)
pain is pulsating or throbbing
pain level is moderate or severe
pain gets worse when you move, like when walking or climbing stairs
attack has at least one of these traits:
it makes you sensitive to light (photophobia)
it makes you sensitive to sound (phonophobia)
you experience nausea with or without vomiting or diarrhea
attack isn�t caused by another health problem or diagnosis
Migraine with aura
An aura typically occurs in 25 percent of people
who have migraine.
If you have a migraine with aura, you most likely have at least two attacks that have these characteristics:
an aura that goes away, is completely reversible, and includes at least one of these symptoms:
visual problems (the most common aura symptom)
sensory problems of the body, face, or tongue, like numbness, tingling, or dizziness
speech or language problems
problems moving or weakness, which may last up to 72 hours
brainstem symptoms, which includes:
difficulty talking or dysarthria (unclear speech)
vertigo (a spinning feeling)
tinnitus or ringing in the ears
diplopia (double vision)
ataxia or an inability to control body movements
eye problems in only one eye, including flashes of light, blind spots, or temporary blindness (when these symptoms occur, they�re called retinal migraines)
an aura that has at least two of these traits:
at least one symptom spread gradually over 5 or more minutes
each symptom of the aura lasts between 5 minutes and 1 hour (if you have three symptoms, they may last up to 3 hours)
at least one symptom of the aura is only on one side of the head, including vision, speech, or language problems
aura occurs with the attack or 1 hour before the attack begins
attack isn�t caused by another health problem and transient ischemic attack has been excluded as a cause
An aura usually occurs before the headache pain begins, but it can continue once the attack starts. Alternatively, an aura may start at the same time as the attack does.
Chronic migraine
Chronic migraine used to be called a �combination� or �mixed� because it can have features of migraine and a tension headache. It�s also sometimes called a severe migraine headache and can be caused by medication overuse.
People who have chronic migraine have a severe tension headache or migraine attack more than 15 days a month for 3 or more months. More than eight of those attacks are migraine with or without aura.
Some additional risk factors that may make an individual susceptible to chronic migraine include:
anxiety
depression
another type of chronic pain, like arthritis
other serious health problems (comorbidities), like high blood pressure
previous head or neck injuries
Acute migraine is a general term for a migraine attack that isn�t diagnosed as chronic
. Another name for this type is episodic migraine.
People who have episodic migraine have attacks up to 14 days a month. Thus, people with episodic migraine have fewer attacks a month than people with chronic ones.
Vestibular migraine is also known as migraine-associated vertigo. About 1 percent of the general population lives with vestibular migraine. The symptoms affect balance, cause dizziness, or both. People of any age, including children, may experience vestibular migraine attacks.
If diagnosed, your doctor may suggest you see a vestibular rehabilitation therapist. They can teach you exercises to help you stay balanced when your symptoms are at their worst. Because these migraine attacks can be so debilitating, you and your doctor may talk about taking preventive medications.
According to the National Headache Foundation, menstrual-related migraine affects up to 60 percent of women who experience any type of migraine. It can occur with or without an aura. Attacks can also happen before, during, or after menstruation and during ovulation.
Research has shown that menstrual migraine tends to be more intense, last longer, and have more significant nausea than migraine not associated with the menstrual cycle.
Migraine aura without headache, also called a silent migraine or visual migraine without headache, occurs when a person has an aura, but doesn�t get a headache. This type of migraine is more common in people who start having migraines after age 40.
Visual aura symptoms are most common. With this type of migraine, the aura may gradually occur, with symptoms spreading over several minutes and moving from one symptom to another. After visual symptoms, people may have numbness, speech problems, and/or tingling in the face or hands.
Hormonal migraine, or menstrual migraine, is linked with the female hormones, commonly estrogen. Many people who ovulate report migraine headaches during:
their period
ovulation
pregnancy
perimenopause"
migraine disorders,"for migraine disorders, migraine nausea?","Many people experience nausea as a symptom of migraine. Many also vomit. These symptoms may start at the same time the attack does. Usually, though, they start about 1 hour after the headache pain begins.
Nausea and vomiting can be as troubling as the attack itself. If you only have nausea, you may be able to take your usual migraine medications. Vomiting, though, can prevent you from being able to take pills or keep them in your body long enough to be absorbed. If you have to delay taking migraine medication, migraine is likely to become more severe.
Treating nausea and preventing vomiting
If you have nausea and vomiting, your doctor may suggest medication to ease nausea called anti-nausea or antiemetic drugs. In this case, the antiemetic can help prevent vomiting and improve nausea.
Acupressure may also be helpful in treating migraine nausea. A 2012 study
showed that acupressure reduced the intensity of migraine-associated nausea starting as soon as 30 minutes, gaining improvement over 4 hours."
migraine disorders,"for migraine disorders, migraine prevention?","If you�ve been diagnosed with migraine, there are a few options that may help you prevent a migraine attack. Some may work better for you than others:
Learn the foods, smells, and situations that trigger your migraine attacks and avoid those things when possible.
Stay hydrated. Dehydration can lead to both dizziness and headaches.
Avoid skipping meals when possible.
Focus on quality sleep. A good night�s sleep is important for overall health.
Quit smoking.
Make it a priority to reduce stress in your life.
Invest time and energy in developing relaxation skills.
Exercise regularly. Exercise has been linked to lowered stress levels."
migraine disorders,"for migraine disorders, how is migraine diagnosed??","Doctors diagnose migraine by listening to your symptoms, taking a thorough medical and family history, and performing a physical exam to rule out other potential causes.
Imaging scans, like a CT scan or MRI, can rule out other causes, including:
tumors
abnormal brain structures
stroke"
migraine disorders,"for migraine disorders, devices for migraine?","Surgery for migraine isn�t recommended, but some medical tools have been studied and endorsed for helping lessen migraine attacks by either decreasing or increasing nervous system activity. Currently, the FDA has approved four neuromodulation treatments:
single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulator, a handheld device that produces a magnetic impulse that affects electrical signaling in the brain
transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulator, a small, noninvasive tool that targets the vagus nerve in the neck via electrical stimulation
transcutaneous supraorbital neurostimulator, a device that simulates the supraorbital nerves with electrical stimulation
multi-channel brain neuromodulation system, a headset that can target multiple nerves in the head
Talk with your doctor about the best neuromodulation treatment for you and your specific type of migraine."
migraine disorders,"for migraine disorders, migraine in children?","Children can have many of the same types of migraine as adults.
Until they�re older teens, children may be more likely to have symptoms on both sides of the head. It�s rare for children to have headache pain in the back of the head. Their migraine attacks tend to last 2 to 72 hours.
A few migraine variants are more common in children. One of the more common variants is abdominal migraine.
Abdominal migraine
Children with abdominal migraine may have a stomachache instead of a headache. The pain can be moderate or severe. Usually, pain is in the middle of the stomach, around the belly button. But the pain may not be in this specific area. The belly may just feel �sore.�
Your child may also have experience headache. Other symptoms can include:
lack of appetite
nausea with or without vomiting
sensitivity to light or sound
Children who have abdominal migraine are likely to develop more typical migraine symptoms as adults."
migraine disorders,"for migraine disorders, migraine attacks and pregnancy?","For many pregnant people, their migraine attacks improve during pregnancy. But they may become worse following delivery due to sudden hormonal shifts. Attacks during pregnancy need special attention to make sure that the cause of the attack is understood.
Research is ongoing, but a recent small study
showed that women with migraine during pregnancy experienced a higher rate of having:
preterm or early delivery
preeclampsia
a baby born with low birth weight
Certain migraine medications may not be considered safe during pregnancy. This can include aspirin. If you have migraine during pregnancy, work with your doctor to find ways to treat your migraine that won�t harm your developing baby."
migraine disorders,"for migraine disorders, medication overuse headache?","The frequent and recurring use of migraine medication can sometimes cause what�s known as medication overuse headache
(previously called a rebound headache).
When determining how to deal with migraine, talk with your doctor about the frequency of your medication intake. Also, make sure to discuss alternatives to medications."
migraine disorders,"for migraine disorders, migraine vs. tension headache?","Migraine and tension headaches, the most common type of headaches, share some similar symptoms. But migraine is also associated with many symptoms not shared by tension headaches. Migraine and tension headaches also respond differently to the same treatments.
Both tension headaches and migraine can have:
mild-to-moderate pain
a steady ache
pain on both sides of the head
Only migraine can have these symptoms:
moderate-to-severe pain
pounding or throbbing
an inability to do your usual activities
pain on one side of the head
nausea with or without vomiting
an aura
sensitivity to light, sound, or both"
migraine disorders,"for migraine disorders, migraine home remedies?","You can try a few things at home that may also help remedy the pain from migraine:
Lie down in a quiet, darkroom.
Massage your scalp or temples.
Place a cold cloth over your forehead or behind your neck."
migraine disorders,"for migraine disorders, takeaway?","Sometimes the symptoms of migraine can mimic those of a stroke. It�s important to seek immediate medical attention if you or a loved one has a headache that:
causes slurred speech or drooping on one side of the face
causes new leg or arm weakness
comes on very suddenly and severely with no lead-in symptoms or warning
occurs with a fever, neck stiffness, confusion, seizure, double vision, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking
has an aura where the symptoms last longer than an hour
would be called the �worst headache ever�
is accompanied by loss of consciousness
If headaches are getting in the way of your daily life, and you�re not sure if they are a migraine symptom, it�s important to talk with your doctor. Headaches can be a sign of other issues, and while migraine can feel debilitating at times, there are many treatments available.
The sooner you start to talk about your symptoms, the sooner your doctor can get you on a treatment plan that may include medication and lifestyle changes.

Could you describe what pancytopenia is? I�d like to know more about pancytopenia. Can you help? What information do you have on pancytopenia? Could you provide information on pancytopenia?,"Overview
Pancytopenia is a condition in which a person�s body has too few red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Each of these blood cell types has a different job in the body:
If you have pancytopenia, you have a combination of three different blood diseases:
Because your body needs all of these blood cells, pancytopenia can be very serious. It can even be life-threatening if you don�t treat it."
pancytopenia,"for pancytopenia, symptoms of pancytopenia?","Mild pancytopenia often doesn�t cause symptoms. Your doctor might discover it while doing a blood test for another reason.
More severe pancytopenia can cause symptoms including:
shortness of breath
pale skin
fatigue
weakness
fever
dizziness
easy bruising
bleeding
tiny purple spots on your skin, called petechiae
larger purple spots on your skin, called purpura
bleeding gums and nosebleeds
fast heart rate
If you or someone close to you has any of the following serious symptoms and pancytopenia, get medical care right away:
fever over 101�F (38.3�C)
seizures
heavy bleeding
severe shortness of breath
confusion
loss of consciousness"
pancytopenia,"for pancytopenia, pancytopenia causes and risk factors?","Pancytopenia starts because of a problem with your bone marrow. This spongy tissue inside bones is where blood cells are produced. Diseases and exposure to certain drugs and chemicals can lead to this bone marrow damage.
You�re more likely to develop pancytopenia if you have one of these conditions:
cancers that affect the bone marrow, such as:
leukemia
multiple myeloma
Hodgkin�s or non-Hodgkin�s lymphoma
myelodysplastic syndromes
megaloblastic anemia, a condition in which your body produces larger-than-normal, immature red blood cells and you have a low red blood cell count
aplastic anemia, a condition in which your body stops making enough new blood cells
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare blood disease that causes red blood cells to be destroyed
viral infections, such as:
Epstein-Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis
cytomegalovirus
HIV
hepatitis
malaria
sepsis (a blood infection)
diseases that damage bone marrow, such as Gaucher disease
damage from chemotherapy or radiation treatments for cancer
exposure to chemicals in the environment, such as radiation, arsenic, or benzene
bone marrow disorders that run in families
vitamin deficiencies, such as lack of vitamin B-12 or folate
enlargement of your spleen, known as splenomegaly
liver disease
excess alcohol use that damages your liver
autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus
In about half of all cases, doctors can�t find a cause for pancytopenia. This is called idiopathic pancytopenia."
pancytopenia,"for pancytopenia, complications caused by pancytopenia?","Complications from pancytopenia stem from a lack of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. These problems can include:
excess bleeding if platelets are affected
increased risk for infections if white blood cells are affected
Severe pancytopenia can be life-threatening."
pancytopenia,"for pancytopenia, how pancytopenia is diagnosed?","If your doctor suspects you have pancytopenia, they�ll likely recommend that you see a hematologist � a specialist who treats blood diseases. This specialist will want to learn your family history and personal medical history. During the exam, the doctor will ask about your symptoms and look at your ears, nose, throat, mouth, and skin.
The doctor will also do a complete blood count (CBC). This test measures the amount of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. If the CBC is abnormal, you might need a peripheral blood smear. This test places a drop of your blood on a slide to look at the different types of blood cells it contains.
To look for a problem with your bone marrow, your doctor will likely do a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. In this test, your doctor uses a needle to remove a small amount of liquid and tissue from inside your bone that can then be tested and examined in a lab.
Your doctor might also do separate tests to look for the cause of pancytopenia. These tests can include blood tests to check for infections or leukemia. You might also need a CT scan or other imaging test to look for cancer or other problems with your organs."
pancytopenia,"for pancytopenia, treatment options?","Your doctor will treat the problem that caused pancytopenia. This might include taking you off a medicine or stopping your exposure to a certain chemical. If your immune system is attacking your bone marrow, you�ll get medicine to dampen your body�s immune response.
Treatments for pancytopenia include:
drugs to stimulate blood cell production in your bone marrow
blood transfusions to replace red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets
antibiotics to treat an infection
a bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, which replaces damaged bone marrow with healthy stem cells that rebuild bone marrow"
pancytopenia,"for pancytopenia, outlook?","The outlook for pancytopenia depends on what disease caused the condition and how your doctor treats it. If a drug or chemical caused pancytopenia, it should get better within a week after you stop the exposure. Some conditions, like cancer, will take longer to treat."
pancytopenia,"for pancytopenia, prevention of pancytopenia?","Some causes of pancytopenia, like cancer or inherited bone marrow diseases, aren�t preventable. You may be able to prevent certain types of infection with good hygiene practices and by avoiding contact with anyone who is sick. You can also avoid chemicals that are known to cause this condition."

They are common and may or may not produce symptoms. People with symptoms usually need to have their gallbladders taken out.
Read on to learn more about gallstones, the symptoms they can cause, and how to treat them."
cholelithiasis or biliary calculus,"for cholelithiasis or biliary calculus, what are gallstones??","Your gallbladder is a small organ in your upper right abdomen, right below your liver. It�s a pouch that stores bile, a green-yellow liquid that helps digestion. Issues with your gallbladder typically occur when something is blocking its bile duct�like a gallstone.
Most gallstones are created when substances found in bile, like cholesterol, harden. Gallstones are very common and routinely asymptomatic.
However, about 10 percent
of people who are diagnosed with gallstones will develop noticeable symptoms within 5 years.

cholelithiasis or biliary calculus,"for cholelithiasis or biliary calculus, signs and symptoms of gallstones?","Gallstones can lead to pain in the upper right abdomen or the center of your stomach. You may experience gallbladder pain from time to time after you eat foods that are high in fat, such as fried foods, but the pain can occur at almost any time.
Pain caused by gallstone issues usually lasts for only a few hours, but it can feel severe.
If gallstones are left untreated or unidentified, the symptoms may increase to include:
a high temperature
rapid heartbeat
yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)
itchy skin
diarrhea
chills
confusion
a loss of appetite
These symptoms can be signs of a gallbladder infection, or inflammation of the gallbladder, liver, or pancreas.
Because gallstone symptoms may mimic the symptoms of other serious issues like appendicitis and pancreatitis, no matter what, if you�re dealing with one or more of these issues � it�s time to see a doctor or get yourself to the ER.
If you need help finding a urologist, then check out our FindCare tool here.
Asymptomatic gallstones
Gallstones themselves don�t cause pain. Rather, pain occurs when gallstones block the movement of bile from the gallbladder.
According to the American College of Gastroenterology, about 80 percent of people who have gallstones have �silent gallstones.� This means they don�t experience pain or have symptoms. In these cases, your doctor may discover the gallstones from X-rays or during abdominal surgery."
cholelithiasis or biliary calculus,"for cholelithiasis or biliary calculus, causes?","The actual cause of gallstones is thought to be due to a chemical imbalance of bile inside of the gallbladder. While researchers still aren�t clear about what exactly causes that imbalance to happen, there are a few possible reasons:
Too much cholesterol in your bile
Having too much cholesterol in your bile can lead to yellow cholesterol stones. These hard stones may develop if your liver makes more cholesterol than your bile can dissolve.
Too much bilirubin in your bile
Bilirubin is a chemical produced during the normal breakdown of red blood cells. After it�s created, it passes through the liver and is eventually excreted out of the body.
Some conditions, such as liver damage and certain blood disorders, cause your liver to produce more bilirubin than it should. Pigment gallstones form when your gallbladder can�t break down the excess bilirubin. These hard stones are often dark brown or black.
Concentrated bile due to a full gallbladder
Your gallbladder needs to be able to empty its bile to function properly. If it fails to empty its bile content, the bile becomes overly concentrated, which can cause stones to form."
cholelithiasis or biliary calculus,"for cholelithiasis or biliary calculus, treatment?","Most of the time, you won�t need treatment for gallstones unless they cause you pain. Sometimes you can pass gallstones without even noticing. If you�re in pain, your doctor will likely recommend surgery. In rare cases, medication may be used.
If you�re at high risk for surgery complications, there are a few nonsurgical ways to attempt to treat gallstones. However, if surgery isn�t performed, your gallstones may come back � even with additional treatment. This means you may need to keep an eye on your condition for the majority of your life.
Surgery
Cholecystectomy, which is surgery to remove the gallbladder, is one of the most common operations
performed on adults in the United States. Because the gallbladder isn�t an essential organ, it�s possible to live a healthy life without it.
There are two types of cholecystectomy:
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This is a common surgery that requires general anesthesia. The surgeon will usually make three or four incisions in your abdomen. They�ll then insert a small, lighted device into one of the incisions, check for stones, and carefully remove your gallbladder. You can usually go home on the day of the procedure or the day after if you have no complications.
Open cholecystectomy.This surgery is typically performed when the gallbladder is inflamed, infected, or scarred. This surgery may also happen if problems occur during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
You may experience loose or watery stools after gallbladder removal. Removing a gallbladder involves rerouting the bile from the liver to the small intestine. Bile no longer goes through the gallbladder and it becomes less concentrated. The immediate result is a laxative effect that can cause diarrhea, but this issue should resolve on its own for most people.
Nonsurgical treatments
If surgery can�t be performed, such as if the patient is a much older individual, there are a few other ways doctors can try to get rid of your gallstones.
Oral dissolution therapy typically includes using the medications ursodiol (Actigall) and chenodiol (Chenix) to break up gallstones. These medications contain bile acids, which work to break up the stones. This treatment is best suited for breaking up cholesterol stones and can take many months or years to work completely.
Shock wave lithotripsy is another option. A lithotripter is a machine that generates shock waves that pass through a person. These shock waves can break gallstones into smaller pieces.
Percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder involves placing a sterile needle into the gallbladder to aspirate (draw out) bile. A tube is then inserted to help with additional drainage. This procedure isn�t typically a first line of defense and tends to be an option for individuals who may not be suited for other procedures."
cholelithiasis or biliary calculus,"for cholelithiasis or biliary calculus, risk factors for gallstones?","Some risk factors for gallstones are related to diet, while other factors are not as controllable. Uncontrollable risk factors are things like age, race, sex, and family history.
Lifestyle risk factors
living with obesity
a diet high in fat or cholesterol and low in fiber

While some medications may increase your risk of gallstones, don�t stop taking them unless you have discussed it with your doctor and have their approval."
cholelithiasis or biliary calculus,"for cholelithiasis or biliary calculus, diagnosis?","Your doctor will perform a physical examination that includes checking your eyes and skin for visible changes in color. A yellowish tint may be a sign of jaundice, the result of too much bilirubin in your body.
The exam may involve using diagnostic tests that help your doctor see inside your body. These tests include:
Ultrasound. An ultrasound produces images of your abdomen. It�s the preferred imaging method to confirm that you have gallstone disease. It can also show abnormalities associated with acute cholecystitis.
Abdominal CT scan. This imaging test takes pictures of your liver and abdominal region.
Gallbladder radionuclide scan. This important scan takes about one hour to complete. A specialist injects a radioactive substance into your veins. The substance travels through your blood to the liver and gallbladder. On a scan, it can reveal evidence to suggest infection or blockage of the bile ducts from stones.
Blood tests. Your doctor may order blood tests that measure the amount of bilirubin in your blood. The tests also help determine how well your liver is functioning."
cholelithiasis or biliary calculus,"for cholelithiasis or biliary calculus, diet and foods to eat in moderation?","To help improve your condition and reduce your risk of gallstones, try these tips:
Eat fewer refined carbs (like cookies and white bread) and less sugar.
Increase your intake of healthy fats, like fish oil and olive oil, which may help your gallbladder contract and empty on a regular basis.
Eat the proper amount of fiber per day (women need about 25 grams a day, men need about 38 grams a day).
Get some sort of physical activity every day.
Keep yourself properly hydrated.
If you plan to lose weight, do it slowly. Rapid weight loss may increase your risk of gallstones and other health problems."
cholelithiasis or biliary calculus,"for cholelithiasis or biliary calculus, prevention?","While there is no foolproof way to completely prevent gallstones, cholesterol seems to play a major role in their formation. If you have a family history of gallstones, your doctor may advise you to limit foods with a high saturated fat content. Some of these foods include:
fatty meat, like sausage and bacon
cakes and cookies
lard and cream
certain cheeses
Because people living with obesity are more predisposed to gallstones, keeping your weight within a moderate range is another way to limit the possibility of their formation."
cholelithiasis or biliary calculus,"for cholelithiasis or biliary calculus, long-term outlook?","If your doctor has diagnosed you with gallstones and decides you need surgery to remove them or your gallbladder, the outlook is often positive. In most cases of stone removal, stones don�t return.
If you aren�t able to have surgery and decide to take medication to dissolve the stones, the gallstones can return, so you and your doctor will need to monitor your progress.
If your gallstones aren�t causing symptoms, you will most likely not need to do anything. Still, you may want to make lifestyle changes to prevent them from getting bigger and causing problems."
tachycardia sinus,what is tachycardia sinus? Tell me about tachycardia sinus? What kind of disease is tachycardia sinus? Can you elaborate on tachycardia sinus? What can you tell me about tachycardia sinus? Could you describe what tachycardia sinus is? I�d like to know more about tachycardia sinus. Can you help? What information do you have on tachycardia sinus? Could you provide information on tachycardia sinus?,"Sinus tachycardia refers to a faster-than-usual heart rhythm. It can occur with exercise, anxiety, or stress, but it can sometimes signal an underlying health condition."
tachycardia sinus,"for tachycardia sinus, what is sinus tachycardia??","Sinus tachycardia refers to a faster-than-typical heart rhythm.
Your heart has a natural pacemaker called the sinus node, which generates electrical impulses that move through your heart muscle and cause it to contract, or beat. When these electrical impulses are transmitted normally, it�s referred to as normal sinus rhythm. Normal sinus rhythm typically results in a heart rate of 60 to 100
beats per minute.
Sometimes, these electrical impulses are sent out faster than this typical rhythm, causing sinus tachycardia. This results in a heart rate of over 100
beats per minute. However, this is usually a temporary response and may only be concerning if tachycardia persists during times of rest."
tachycardia sinus,"for tachycardia sinus, inappropriate sinus tachycardia?","If you have sinus tachycardia with no known cause, it�s called inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST). This can cause an inexplicably fast heart rate even while you�re resting.
In addition to rapid heart rate, IST can cause:
shortness of breath
chest pain
dizziness or fainting
headaches
trouble exercising
anxiety"
tachycardia sinus,"for tachycardia sinus, what causes sinus tachycardia??","In some situations, sinus tachycardia can be completely natural. For example, a fast heart rate is expected during strenuous exercise or after being startled.
Other causes of sinus tachycardia may include:
anxiety or emotional distress
fever
some medications, such as those used in allergy or mental health treatment
pain
stimulants, such as caffeine or nicotine
recreational drugs, such as cocaine
Other potential but less common causes of sinus tachycardia may include the following underlying health conditions:
anemia
an infection
damage to your heart muscle, such as from a previous heart attack
hyperthyroidism
low blood pressure
lung disease
pulmonary embolism
severe bleeding
Doctors aren�t sure about the exact cause of IST, but it likely involves a combination of factors. These may include:
a problem with your sinus node
unusual nerve signaling that causes your heart rate to increase
dysfunction of the nerves that work to lower your heart rate"
tachycardia sinus,"for tachycardia sinus, sinus tachycardia symptoms?","In most cases
, sinus tachycardia is asymptomatic (you don�t feel any symptoms). However, it�s possible to experience the following symptoms related to this condition:
heart palpitations
chest pain
dizziness or lightheadedness
fainting
breathing difficulties"
tachycardia sinus,"for tachycardia sinus, sinus tachycardia treatment?","Occasional sinus tachycardia from exercise and other factors that cause short-term increases in your heart rate generally don�t require treatment. However, a doctor may consider treatment if you have a consistently higher heart rate than typical, especially during times of rest.
First, a doctor will need to determine the underlying cause of sinus tachycardia before prescribing treatment. Depending on how fast your heart rate is, a doctor might prescribe beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers to lower your heart rate.
In severe cases that don�t respond to medication or lifestyle changes, you may need a cardiac ablation procedure. This involves using energy to destroy a tiny part of the heart tissue in the area causing tachycardia."
tachycardia sinus,"for tachycardia sinus, how is sinus tachycardia diagnosed??","To diagnose sinus tachycardia, a doctor may order tests to measure how your heart is working. These may include:
an electrocardiogram (EKG), which measures electrical activity in your heart
a Holter monitor, which measures your heart rate over 24 hours
chest X-rays
pulse oximetry
blood testing for cardiac enzymes, glucose, and complete blood count (CBC)"
tachycardia sinus,"for tachycardia sinus, how can i prevent sinus tachycardia??","Preventing sinus tachycardia may depend on treating any underlying causes.
For example, if you have hyperthyroidism and it�s causing a higher-than-typical heart rate, then treating your overactive thyroid gland may help prevent sinus tachycardia.
In other cases, you may be able to prevent sinus tachycardia with certain lifestyle changes. You may consider talking with a doctor to see if the following strategies may help:
limiting caffeine intake
limiting or avoiding alcohol
quitting smoking, if you smoke
participating in an exercise program
eating a heart-healthy diet
achieving or maintaining a moderate weight
managing stress"
tachycardia sinus,"for tachycardia sinus, outlook?","Sinus tachycardia is an increase in your heart rate. In many cases, it�s a sign of something simple, such as vigorous exercise or having too much caffeine. Such cases are usually temporary and may resolve on their own. In the case of IST, however, there�s no known cause.
If you have IST, a doctor will work closely with you to determine a treatment plan. Treatment will likely involve a combination of medications and lifestyle changes. These may help prevent possible complications, such as cardiomyopathy or cardiac arrest."
tachycardia sinus,"for tachycardia sinus, the bottom line?","Sinus tachycardia is a faster-than-typical heart rhythm. It may occur with exercise, anxiety, or stress.
IST refers to sinus tachycardia with no known cause that can occur even when resting.
Underlying health issues, such as infections, lung disease, or conditions like pulmonary embolism, can cause sinus tachycardia."
ileus,what is ileus? Tell me about ileus? What kind of disease is ileus? Can you elaborate on ileus? What can you tell me about ileus? Could you describe what ileus is? I�d like to know more about ileus. Can you help? What information do you have on ileus? Could you provide information on ileus?,"Your intestines are about 28 feet long. This means the foods you eat have a long way to travel before they�re fully digested and excreted.
Your intestines complete this task using muscle contractions that move in a wave-like motion. Known as peristalsis, these muscle contractions move your digested food forward.
However, if something such as muscle or nerve problems slows down or blocks this motion, the result can be a major traffic jam in your intestines.
Ileus is the medical term for this lack of movement somewhere in the intestines that leads to a buildup and potential blockage of food material.
An ileus can lead to an intestinal obstruction. This means no food material, gas, or liquids can get through.
It can occur as a side effect after surgery. However, there are other causes of this condition.
An ileus is a serious concern. However, people with an ileus often don�t know that food is building up in their intestines, so they continue to eat. This pushes more and more material toward the buildup.
Without treatment, the ileus can perforate or tear the intestine. This causes bowel contents � which have high levels of bacteria � to leak into areas of your body cavity. This can be deadly.
If an ileus does occur, it�s important to get treatment as quickly as possible."
ileus,"for ileus, what are the causes of an ileus??","An ileus is common after surgery because people are often prescribed medication that can slow intestinal movement. This is a type of paralytic ileus.
In this instance, the intestine is not blocked. Rather, it isn�t moving properly. The result is little to no movement of digested food through your intestines.
Examples of medications that can cause a paralytic ileus include:
hydromorphone (Dilaudid)
morphine
oxycodone
tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline and imipramine (Tofranil)
However, there are several other possible causes of an ileus. These include:
intestinal cancer
diverticulitis
Parkinson�s disease, which affects muscles and nerves in the intestines
Crohn�s disease, which rarely causes a blockage but may cause the intestinal walls to thicken due to autoimmune inflammation
These are the most common causes of an ileus in adults. Children can also have an ileus.
Intussusception is the most common cause of an ileus in children. This is when a part of the intestine �telescopes� or slides into itself.
Gastrointestinal symptoms are the most common signs of an ileus. Your stomach and intestines will start to fill with gas that can�t pass out the rectum. This causes the abdomen to take on a tight and swollen appearance.
If you experience these symptoms, especially after surgery, it�s important to seek immediate medical attention."
ileus,"for ileus, how is an ileus treated??","The treatment for an ileus depends on its severity. The severity can depend on whether it�s causing a partial or complete intestinal obstruction, or if it�s a paralytic ileus.
Partial obstruction
Sometimes a condition like Crohn�s disease or diverticulitis will mean that part of the intestine is not moving. However, some bowel material can get through.
In this instance, if you are otherwise stable, your doctor may recommend a low-fiber diet. This can help reduce the bulky stool, making it easier to pass.
However, if that doesn�t work, surgery may be needed to repair or move the affected portion of the bowel.
Complete obstruction
A complete obstruction is a medical emergency.
Treatment will depend on your overall health. For example, extensive abdominal surgery is not suitable for some people. This includes older adults and those with colon cancer.
In this case, a doctor may use a metal stent to make the intestine more open. Ideally, food will start to pass with the stent.
Abdominal surgery to remove the blockage or the damaged intestine portion may still be needed, however.
Paralytic ileus
Treatment for a paralytic ileus starts by figuring out the underlying cause.
If medication is the cause, your doctor may be able to prescribe another medication to stimulate gastrointestinal motility (intestine movement). One medication they may prescribe is metoclopramide (Reglan).
If possible, discontinuing the medications that caused the ileus can also help. However, you should not stop taking a medication, especially an antidepressant, without your doctor�s approval.
Treatment without surgery is possible during the early stages of a paralytic ileus. You may still require a hospital stay to get the proper fluids intravenously until the issue is fully resolved.
In addition to intravenous fluid hydration, your doctor may use nasogastric decompression. During this procedure, a tube is inserted into your nasal cavity to reach your stomach. The tube suctions out the extra air and material that you may otherwise vomit.
Most surgery-related ileus will resolve within 2 to 4 days after surgery. However, some people do require surgery if the condition does not improve.
Considerations for surgery
Your intestines are very long, so you can live without a portion of them. While it may affect the digestive process, most people do live a healthy life with part of their intestine removed.
In some instances, your doctor may have to remove your entire intestine. In this case, your doctor will create a special pouch called an ostomy. This bag allows stool to drain from your remaining gastrointestinal tract.
You have to care for the ostomy, but you can live without your intestine after an ileus."
ileus,"for ileus, what are the symptoms of an ileus??","An ileus can cause extreme abdominal discomfort.
Symptoms associated with an ileus include:
abdominal cramping
appetite loss
feeling of fullness
constipation
inability to pass gas
abdominal swelling
nausea
vomiting, especially with stool-like contents"
ileus,"for ileus, how is an ileus diagnosed??","Your doctor will usually first listen to a description of your symptoms. You�ll likely be asked about any history of medical conditions, prescribed medications, and surgeries, especially recent procedures.
Your doctor may then conduct a physical exam, looking at your abdomen for signs of swelling or tightness. Your doctor will also listen with a stethoscope to your abdomen for typical bowel sounds.
If your bowels aren�t moving because of an ileus, your doctor may not hear anything or may hear excessive bowel sounds.
Imaging studies are usually ordered after a thorough physical exam. These can indicate where an ileus is located by showing a buildup of gas, an enlarged intestine, or even an obstruction. Your doctor may use these to identify areas where your bowel content seems to be concentrated.
Examples of imaging studies include:
Plain film X-ray. This may show signs of trapped gas and possibly the obstruction, but plain film X-rays aren�t always the most conclusive way to diagnose an ileus.
CT scan. This scan provides more detailed X-ray images to help your doctor identify the potential area where the ileus is located. A CT scan typically uses contrast agents injected intravenously or taken orally.
Ultrasound. An ultrasound is more commonly used to identify an ileus in children.
In some instances, your doctor may use a diagnostic procedure known as an air or barium enema.
During this procedure, the doctor inserts air or barium sulfate, a radiopaque substance, through your rectum into your colon. While the doctor does this, a technician takes X-rays of your abdomen. The air or barium shows up on the X-ray to help the technician view any potential obstruction.
In some children, this procedure can treat an ileus caused by intussusception."
ileus,"for ileus, risk factors for ileus?","According to 2015 research, ileus is the second
most common reason for hospital readmission in the first 30 days after surgery. An ileus is more likely if you�ve recently had abdominal surgery.
Surgical procedures on the abdomen that involve handling the intestines commonly cause a stoppage of intestinal movement for a period of time. This allows the surgeon to access your intestines.
Sometimes normal peristalsis can be slow to return. Other people are more likely to later experience scar tissue formation that can also lead to an ileus.
A number of medical conditions can increase your risk of ileus. They include:
electrolyte imbalance, such as those involving potassium and calcium
history of intestinal injury or trauma
history of intestinal disorder, such as Crohn�s disease and diverticulitis
sepsis
history of exposure to high-energy radiation (irradiation) near the abdomen
peripheral artery disease
rapid weight loss
Aging also naturally slows down how fast the intestines move. An older adult is at greater risk for ileus, especially since they tend to take more medications that could potentially slow the movement of material through the intestines."
ileus,"for ileus, ileus vs. other blocks of the intestines?","An ileus is referred to as a �nonmechanical bowel obstruction� because it occurs when the digestive tract stops normal movement. However, some conditions may cause a physical blockage, or mechanical obstruction, of the intestines.
Conditions that may cause a physical blockage of the intestines include the following:
hernia
scar tissue after surgery
intestinal tumors
swallowed foreign objects
stool stuck in your rectum or colon (impacted bowel)
volvulus, when the intestines become twisted
gallstones, although this is rare"
ileus,"for ileus, what complications can an ileus cause??","An ileus can develop into a serious and potentially life threatening situation.
Two of the most severe complications are necrosis and peritonitis.
Necrosis
Necrosis is the untimely death of cells or tissue. It can happen when an obstruction cuts off the blood supply to the intestine.
Without blood, oxygen cannot get to the tissue, causing it to die. Dead tissue weakens the intestinal wall, making it easy for the intestine to tear and leak bowel contents. This is known as a bowel perforation.
Peritonitis
A bowel perforation due to necrosis can cause peritonitis. This is a serious inflammation in the abdominal cavity caused by bacteria or fungus.
Your bowel contains many bacteria, like E. coli. The bacteria are supposed to remain in your intestines, not roam free in your body cavity. Bacterial peritonitis can turn into sepsis, a life threatening condition that can result in shock and organ failure."
ileus,"for ileus, can an ileus be prevented??","Most of the risk factors associated with an ileus, such as injury or chronic illness, are not preventable.
If you�re going to have surgery, the possibility of getting an ileus should be considered. However, it should not keep you from having needed surgery.
Being aware of the symptoms of an ileus is important in seeking prompt treatment to keep it from getting worse."
ileus,"for ileus, outlook for ileus?","An ileus is highly treatable.
If you�ve had a recent surgery or have other risk factors for an ileus, you should be aware of the symptoms.
Seeking medical care as soon as possible is important so the ileus can potentially be resolved without invasive medical treatment."

I�d like to know more about adhesion. Can you help? What information do you have on adhesion? Could you provide information on adhesion?,"Gallbladder adhesions happen when scar tissue develops around your gallbladder after surgery or an episode of inflammation.
Gallbladder adhesions are bands of scar tissue that form on your gallbladder. This tough adhesive tissue causes your gallbladder to stick to surrounding abdominal tissues. Gallbladder adhesions typically develop after abdominal surgery or when a condition such as gallstones causes inflammation in your gallbladder.
Researchers estimate that about 90%
of adhesions in the abdominal cavity, including gallbladder adhesions, result from abdominal surgery. Gallbladder adhesions often don�t cause symptoms but may complicate future gallbladder surgery.
This article takes a deep look at gallbladder adhesions. You�ll learn what they are, when they�re most likely to develop, and how they affect your health."
adhesion,"for adhesion, what are gallbladder adhesions??","An adhesion is an area of scar tissue that connects two tissues that aren�t usually connected. Gallbladder adhesions can cause your gallbladder to stick to other organs, such as your bowel or omentum. The omentum is a layer of fatty tissue inside your abdominal cavity.
In a 2021 study
from Indonesia, researchers found that slightly more than half of 157 people who received laparoscopic surgery to remove an inflamed gallbladder had adhesions. The researchers believed that most cases were due to delayed surgery."
adhesion,"for adhesion, symptoms of gallbladder adhesions?","In many cases, abdominal adhesions don�t cause any noticeable symptoms or need treatment. But in some cases, they may cause general abdominal symptoms such as pain and cramping."
adhesion,"for adhesion, what causes gallbladder adhesions??","Adhesions are the result of your body creating scar tissue, which it does when it�s healing from an injury.
Gallbladder adhesions can form after surgery or as a result of conditions such as acute cholecystitis. Acute cholecystitis is the sudden inflammation of your gallbladder, typically caused by gallstones. Adhesions usually develop within 96 hours
of this inflammatory event.
About 90%
of people who undergo open abdominal surgery develop some abdominal adhesions. An open surgery is any abdominal surgery performed through large incisions, such as gallbladder removal or cesarean delivery.
Adhesions are less common among people who receive laparoscopic surgery, which is the method used in most gallbladder procedures today. Laparoscopic surgery involves making small incisions and using a thin tube with a camera and other small surgical tools. Weight loss surgery and laparotomy are other common abdominal laparoscopic procedures."
adhesion,"for adhesion, complications of gallbladder adhesions?","The gold standard treatment
for sudden gallbladder inflammation is laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the removal of the gallbladder through a small incision.
The formation of adhesions between the gallbladder and other tissues, such as the omentum or bowel, can complicate laparoscopic surgery. When surgeons cut through adhesions, they risk damaging your gallbladder or bile duct.
Surgeons may have to switch from laparoscopic surgery to more invasive open surgery if they discover adhesions during your gallbladder procedure. This helps them ensure that they can access your gallbladder safely.
Researchers estimate that 4�15% of laparoscopic gallbladder removal surgeries must be converted to open surgery. Gallbladder adhesions are one of the main reasons for conversion.
Bowel obstruction
Some abdominal adhesions can cause bowel obstruction, which can be life threatening. Possible symptoms include:
severe abdominal pain
constipation
inability to pass gas
nausea and vomiting
bloating
It�s critical to seek immediate medical attention any time you develop severe abdominal pain and an inability to pass gas."
adhesion,"for adhesion, diagnosis and treatment of gallbladder adhesions?","Adhesions are common after abdominal surgery. Surgeons often won�t perform laparoscopic gallbladder surgery if you have a history of abdominal surgery due to the high risk of adhesions.
Types of surgeries that may cause gallbladder adhesions include:
small intestine or stomach ulcer surgery
major bowel surgery
major blood vessel surgery
emergency abdominal surgery
Surgeries that involve a small incision, such as an appendectomy, rarely interfere with successful laparoscopic gallbladder surgery.
Doctors may be able to see whether you have gallbladder adhesions before your surgery by using a type of imaging called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
Researchers in a 2019 study sought to find out whether an elevated white blood cell count in people with an inflamed gallbladder might be associated with a higher risk of gallbladder adhesions. They did not find a significant correlation."
adhesion,"for adhesion, takeaway?","Gallbladder adhesions are bands of scar tissue that connect your gallbladder to other tissues in your abdomen. They can form after abdominal surgery or as a complication of conditions that cause gallbladder inflammation, such as gallstones.

It�s important to seek help if you experience hallucinations, delusions, or trouble thinking clearly. Most people recover with treatment, such as therapy and medication.
Psychosis is a combination of symptoms resulting in an impaired relationship with reality. It can be a symptom of serious mental health disorders. People who are experiencing psychosis may have either hallucinations or delusions.
Hallucinations are sensory experiences that occur within the absence of an actual stimulus. For example, a person having an auditory hallucination may hear their mother yelling at them when their mother isn�t around. Or someone having a visual hallucination may see something, like a person in front of them, who isn�t actually there.
The person experiencing psychosis may also have thoughts that are contrary to actual evidence. These thoughts are known as delusions. Some people with psychosis may also experience loss of motivation and social withdrawal.
These experiences can be frightening. They may also cause people who are experiencing psychosis to hurt themselves or others.
It�s important to get medical help right away if you or someone else is experiencing symptoms of psychosis."

constant talking with rapid speech patterns
switching topics mid-sentence with no explanation
a sudden loss of their train of thought, causing them to pause or freeze abruptly"
delusion,"for delusion, what are delusions and hallucinations??","Delusions and hallucinations are two very different symptoms that are both often experienced by people with psychosis. Delusions and hallucinations seem real to the person who is experiencing them.
Delusions
A delusion is a false belief or impression that is firmly held even though it�s contradicted by reality and what is commonly considered true. There are delusions of paranoia, grandiose delusions, and somatic delusions.
People who are experiencing a delusion of paranoia might think that they are being followed when they�re not, or that secret messages are being sent to them.
Someone with a grandiose delusion will have an exaggerated sense of importance.
Somatic delusion is when a person believes they have a terminal illness, but in reality they�re healthy.
Hallucinations
A hallucination is a sensory perception in the absence of outside stimuli. That means seeing, hearing, feeling, or smelling something that isn�t present.
A person who is hallucinating might see things that don�t exist or hear people talking when they�re alone."
delusion,"for delusion, causes of psychosis?","Each case of psychosis is different, and the exact cause isn�t always clear. There are certain illnesses that cause psychosis. There are also triggers like drug use, lack of sleep, and other environmental factors. In addition, certain situations can lead to specific types of psychosis developing.
In general, some of the factors involved in psychosis are:
genetics
trauma (such as a death, sexual assault, or living through a war)
substance use (drugs like LSD and amphetamines have been linked
to instances of psychosis in some people)
mental health conditions (like schizophrenia)"
delusion,"for delusion, risk factors for developing psychosis?","It�s not currently possible to precisely identify who is likely to develop psychosis. However, research has shown that genetics may play a role.
People are more likely to develop a psychotic disorder if they have a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, who has a psychotic disorder.
Children born with the genetic mutation known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are at risk of developing a psychotic disorder, especially schizophrenia."
delusion,"for delusion, types of psychosis?","Some kinds of psychosis are brought on by specific conditions or circumstances.
Brief psychotic disorder
Brief psychotic disorder
, sometimes called brief reactive psychosis, can occur during periods of extreme personal stress like the death of a family member.
Someone experiencing brief reactive psychosis will generally recover in a few days to a few weeks, depending on the source of the stress.
Drug- or alcohol-related psychosis
Psychosis can sometimes be triggered by the use of alcohol or drugs, including stimulants such as
methamphetamine.
Hallucinogenic drugs like LSD often cause users to see things that aren�t really there, but this effect is temporary. Some prescription drugs like steroids and stimulants can also cause symptoms of psychosis.
People who have an alcohol or substance use disorder can experience symptoms of psychosis if they suddenly stop drinking or taking those drugs.
Organic psychosis
A head injury, illness, or infection that affects the brain can cause
symptoms of psychosis."
delusion,"for delusion, psychotic disorders?","Psychotic disorders can be triggered by stress, drug or alcohol use, injury, or illness. They can also appear on their own. The following types of disorders may have symptoms of psychosis:
Bipolar disorder
When someone is living with bipolar disorder, they experience extreme mood changes. When their mood is high and positive, they may have symptoms of psychosis. They may feel extremely happy or grandiose.
When their mood is more depressed, the person may have symptoms of psychosis that make them feel angry, sad, or frightened. These symptoms can include thinking someone is trying to harm them.
Delusional disorder
A person experiencing delusional disorder strongly believes in things that aren�t real, even when presented with opposing evidence.
Psychotic depression

Medical tests and X-rays may be used to determine whether there is an underlying illness causing the symptoms.
Diagnosing psychosis in children and teenagers
Many of the symptoms of psychosis in adults aren�t symptoms of psychosis in young people. For example, small children often have imaginary friends with whom they talk. This just represents imaginative play, which is completely normal for children.
But if you�re worried about psychosis in a child or adolescent, it�s best to describe their behavior to a doctor."
delusion,"for delusion, treatment of psychosis?","Treating psychosis may involve a combination of medications and therapy. Most people will experience an improvement in their symptoms with treatment.
Rapid tranquilization
Sometimes people experiencing psychosis can become agitated and be at risk of hurting themselves or others. In these cases, it may be necessary to calm them down quickly.
This method is called rapid tranquilization
. A doctor or emergency response personnel will administer a fast-acting injection or liquid medication to quickly relax the person.
Medication
Symptoms of psychosis can be managed with medications called antipsychotics. They reduce hallucinations and delusions, and help people think more clearly. The type of antipsychotic a doctor prescribes will depend on the symptoms.
In many cases, people only need to take antipsychotics for a short time until their symptoms are more manageable. Others may need to take them more long term.
Cognitive behavioral therapy
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of mental health therapy. Its goal is to change thinking and behaviors. CBT involves regular meetings with a mental health counselor.
CBT has been shown to be effective in helping people better manage their mental health conditions.

What information do you have on coronary artery disease? Could you provide information on coronary artery disease?,"Coronary artery disease is the most common form of heart disease. It happens when something, like plaque buildup, reduces blood flow to the heart. It can increase your risk of heart attack.
Coronary artery disease (CAD) causes impaired blood flow in the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Also called coronary heart disease (CHD), CAD is the most common form of heart disease and affects approximately 16.5 million
Americans over the age of 20.
It�s also the leading ca
use of death
for both men and women in the United States. It�s estimated that every 36 seconds
, someone in the United States has a heart attack.
A heart attack can come from uncontrolled CAD."
coronary artery disease,"for coronary artery disease, coronary artery disease symptoms?","When your heart doesn�t get enough arterial blood, you may experience a variety of symptoms. Angina (chest discomfort) is the most common symptom of CAD. Some people describe this discomfort as:
chest pain
heaviness
tightness
burning
squeezing
These symptoms can also be mistaken for heartburn or indigestion.
Other symptoms of CAD include:
pain in the arms or shoulders
shortness of breath
sweating
dizziness
You may experience more symptoms when your blood flow is more restricted. If a blockage cuts off blood flow completely or almost completely, your heart muscle will start to die if not restored. This is a heart attack.
Don�t ignore any of these symptoms, especially if they are excruciating or last longer than five minutes. Immediate medical treatment is necessary.
Symptoms of CAD for women
Women may also experience the above symptoms, but they�re also more likely to have:
nausea
vomiting
back pain
jaw pain
shortness of breath without feeling chest pain
Men have a higher risk
of developing heart disease than women, however.
Due to decreased blood flow, your heart may also:
become weak
develop abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmia) or rates
fail to pump as much blood as your body needs
Your doctor will detect these heart abnormalities during diagnosis."
coronary artery disease,"for coronary artery disease, causes of coronary artery disease?","The most common cause of CAD is a vascular injury with cholesterol plaque buildup in the arteries, known as atherosclerosis. Reduced blood flow occurs when one or more of these arteries becomes partially or completely blocked.
Other rare causes of damage or blockage to a coronary artery also limit blood flow to the heart."
coronary artery disease,"for coronary artery disease, coronary artery disease risk factors?","Understanding the risk factors for CAD can help with your plan to prevent or decrease the likelihood of developing the disease.
Risk factors include:
high blood pressure
high blood cholesterol levels
tobacco smoking
insulin resistance/hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus
obesity
inactivity
unhealthy eating habits
obstructive sleep apnea
emotional stress
excessive alcohol consumption
history of preeclampsia during pregnancy
The risk for CAD also increases with age. Based on age alone as a risk factor, men have a greater risk for the disease beginning at age 45 and women have a greater risk beginning at age 55. The risk for coronary artery disease is also higher if you have a family history of the disease."
coronary artery disease,"for coronary artery disease, coronary artery disease diagnosis?","Diagnosing CAD requires a review of your medical history, a physical examination, and other medical testing. These tests include:
Electrocardiogram: This test monitors electrical signals that travel through your heart. It may help your doctor determine whether you�ve had a heart attack.
Echocardiogram: This imaging test uses ultrasound waves to create a picture of your heart. The results of this test reveal whether certain things in your heart are functioning properly.
Stress test: This particular test measures the stress on your heart during physical activity and while at rest. The test monitors your heart�s electrical activity while you walk on a treadmill or ride a stationary bike. Nuclear imaging or echocardiographic imaging may also be performed for a portion of this test. For those unable to perform physical exercise, certain medications can be used instead for stress testing.
Cardiac catheterization (left heart catheterization): During this procedure, your doctor injects a special dye into your coronary arteries through a catheter inserted through an artery in your groin or wrist. The dye helps enhance the radiographic image of your coronary arteries to identify any blockages.
Heart CT scan: Your doctor may use this imaging test to check for calcium deposits in your arteries."
coronary artery disease,"for coronary artery disease, coronary artery disease anatomy?","The four primary coronary arteries are located on the surface of the heart:
right main coronary artery
left main coronary artery
left circumflex artery
left anterior descending artery
These arteries bring oxygen and nutrient-rich blood to your heart. Your heart is a muscle that�s responsible for pumping blood throughout your body and needs oxygen all the time. A healthy heart moves approximately 3,000 gallons of blood through your body every day.
Like any other organ or muscle, your heart must receive an adequate, dependable supply of blood in order to carry out its work. Reduced blood flow to your heart can cause symptoms of CAD."
coronary artery disease,"for coronary artery disease, what is the treatment for cad??","It�s important to reduce or control your risk factors and seek treatment to lower the chance of a heart attack or stroke if you�re diagnosed with CAD.
Treatment also depends on your current health condition, risk factors, and overall wellbeing. For example, your doctor may prescribe medication therapy to treat high cholesterol or high blood pressure, or you may receive medication to control blood sugar if you have diabetes.
Medications are the most common treatment for CAD. Learn more here.
Lifestyle changes can also reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke. For example:
quit smoking tobacco
reduce or stop your consumption of alcohol
exercise regularly
lose weight to a healthy level
eat a healthy diet (low in saturated fat, sodium, and added sugar)
If your condition doesn�t improve with lifestyle changes and medication, your doctor may recommend a procedure to increase blood flow to your heart. These procedures may be:
balloon angioplasty: to widen blocked arteries and smoosh down the plaque buildup, usually performed with insertion of a stent to help keep the lumen open after the procedure
coronary artery bypass graft surgery: to restore blood flow to the heart in open chest surgery
enhanced external counterpulsation: to stimulate the formation of new small blood vessels to naturally bypass clogged arteries in a noninvasive procedure"
coronary artery disease,"for coronary artery disease, what is the outlook for cad??","Everyone�s outlook for CAD is different. You have better chances of preventing extensive damage to your heart the earlier you can start your treatment or implement lifestyle changes.
It is important to follow your doctor�s instructions. Take medications as directed and make the recommended lifestyle changes. If you have a higher risk for CAD, you can help to prevent the disease by reducing your risk factors."
congestive heart failure,what is congestive heart failure? Tell me about congestive heart failure? What kind of disease is congestive heart failure? Can you elaborate on congestive heart failure? What can you tell me about congestive heart failure? Could you describe what congestive heart failure is? I�d like to know more about congestive heart failure. Can you help? What information do you have on congestive heart failure? Could you provide information on congestive heart failure?,"Heart failure occurs when your heart cannot pump enough blood to support your body functions. Seek help immediately if you�re experiencing symptoms such as heart palpitations, shortness of breath, or swelling.
Heart failure is characterized by the heart�s inability to pump an adequate supply of blood to the body. Without sufficient blood flow, all major body functions are disrupted. Heart failure is a condition or a collection of symptoms that weaken or stiffen your heart.
In some people with heart failure, the heart has difficulty pumping enough blood to support other organs in the body. Other people may have a hardening and stiffening of the heart muscle itself, which blocks or reduces blood flow to the heart.
Heart failure can affect the right or left side of your heart or both at the same time. It can be either an acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing) condition.
About 6.2 million Americans
have heart failure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Most cases are diagnosed in men. However, women are more likely to die from heart failure when the condition goes untreated.
Heart failure is a serious medical condition that requires treatment. Early treatment increases your chances of long-term recovery with fewer complications. Call your doctor right away if you�re having any symptoms of heart failure."
congestive heart failure,"for congestive heart failure, what causes heart failure??","Heart failure is most often related to another condition. The most common cause of heart failure is coronary artery disease (CAD), a disorder that causes narrowing of the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart. Other conditions that may increase your risk of developing heart failure include:
cardiomyopathy, a disorder of the heart muscle that causes the heart to become weak
congenital heart disease
heart attack
heart valve disease
certain types of arrhythmias, or irregular heart rhythms
high blood pressure
emphysema, a disease of the lung
untreated sleep apnea
diabetes
an overactive or underactive thyroid
HIV
severe forms of anemia
certain cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy
substance misuse disorder"
congestive heart failure,"for congestive heart failure, what are the symptoms of heart failure??","The symptoms of heart failure may include:
fatigue
sudden weight gain
a loss of appetite
persistent coughing
irregular heart rate
heart palpitations
abdominal swelling
shortness of breath
exercise intolerance
leg and ankle swelling or abdomen
sleeping on extra pillows
getting short of breath while lying down
protruding neck veins"
congestive heart failure,"for congestive heart failure, what are the different types of heart failure??","Heart failure can occur in either the left or right side of your heart. It�s also possible for both sides of your heart to fail at the same time.
Heart failure is also classified as either diastolic or systolic.
Left-sided heart failure
Left-sided heart failure is the most common type of heart failure.
The left ventricle is located in the bottom left side of your heart. This area pumps oxygen-rich blood to the rest of your body.
Left-sided heart failure occurs when the left ventricle doesn�t pump efficiently. This prevents your body from getting enough oxygen-rich blood. The blood backs up into your lungs instead, which causes shortness of breath and a buildup of fluid.
Right-sided heart failure
The right heart ventricle is responsible for pumping blood to your lungs to collect oxygen. Right-sided heart failure occurs when the right side of your heart can�t perform its job effectively.
It�s usually triggered by left-sided heart failure. The accumulation of blood in the lungs caused by left-sided heart failure makes the right ventricle work harder. This can stress the right side of the heart and cause it to fail.
Right-sided heart failure can also occur because of other conditions, such as lung disease or valve disease. Right-sided heart failure is marked by swelling of the lower extremities or abdomen. This swelling is caused by fluid backup in the legs, feet, and abdomen.
Diastolic heart failure
Diastolic heart failure occurs when the heart muscle becomes stiffer than normal. The stiffness, which is usually due to heart disease, means that your heart doesn�t fill with blood easily. This is known as diastolic dysfunction. It leads to a lack of blood flow to the rest of the organs in your body.
Diastolic heart failure is more common in people who are female than in those who are male.
Systolic heart failure
Systolic heart failure occurs when the heart muscle loses its ability to contract. The contractions of the heart are necessary to pump oxygen-rich blood out to the body. This problem is known as systolic dysfunction, and it usually develops when your heart is weak and may be enlarged.
Systolic heart failure is more common in males than in females.
Both diastolic and systolic heart failure can occur on the left or right sides of the heart. You may have either condition on both sides of the heart."
congestive heart failure,"for congestive heart failure, what are the risk factors for heart failure??","Heart failure can happen to anyone. However, certain factors may increase your risk of developing this condition.
There is a higher incidence of heart failure in men compared with women, though the prevalence is about the same for all sexes.
People with diseases that damage the heart are also at an increased risk. These conditions include:
hypertension
sleep apnea
diabetes
coronary artery disease
valve disease
anemia
hyperthyroidism
hypothyroidism
emphysema
Certain behaviors can also increase your risk of developing heart failure, including:
smoking
eating foods that are high in fat or cholesterol
not getting enough exercise
having overweight or obesity"
congestive heart failure,"for congestive heart failure, how is heart failure diagnosed??","Physical exam
Your doctor may perform a physical exam to check for signs of heart failure. For instance, leg swelling, irregular heart rate, and bulging neck veins may lead your doctor to diagnose heart failure.
Echocardiogram
An echocardiogram is the most effective way to diagnose heart failure. It uses sound waves to create detailed pictures of your heart, which help your doctor evaluate the damage to your heart, the squeezing and relaxing function and determine the underlying causes of your condition.
Your doctor may use an echocardiogram along with other tests.
Other tests
chest X-ray This test can provide images of the heart and the surrounding organs.
heart MRI An MRI produces images of the heart without the use of radiation.
nuclear scan A very small dose of radioactive material is injected into your body to create images of the chambers of your heart.
catheterization or coronary angiogram In this type of X-ray exam, the doctor inserts a catheter into your blood vessel, usually in the groin or arm. They then guide it into the heart. This test can show how much blood is currently flowing through the heart.
stress exam During a stress exam, an EKG machine monitors your heart function while you run on a treadmill or perform another type of exercise.
Holter monitoring Electrode patches are placed on your chest and attached to a small machine called a Holter monitor for this test. The machine records the electrical activity of your heart for at least 24 to 48 hours.
BNP blood test A BNP test is done by drawing blood from a vein in your arm. This test can detect a rise in B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) hormone, which can be an indication of heart failure."
congestive heart failure,"for congestive heart failure, how is heart failure treated??","Treating heart failure depends on the severity of your condition and the type of heart failure you have.
Early treatment can improve symptoms fairly quickly, but you should still get regular testing and follow up with your doctor every 3 to 6 months. The main goal of treatment is to increase your lifespan.
Treatment of heart failure may include one or more of the following:
medication
bypass surgery
percutaneous coronary intervention
a pacemaker
an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
transplant surgery
Let�s take a closer look at each of these treatments and what they entail.
Medication
Early stages of heart failure may be treated with medications to help relieve your symptoms and prevent your condition from getting worse. Certain medications are prescribed to:
improve your heart�s ability to pump blood
reduce blood clots
reduce your heart rate, when necessary
remove excess sodium and replenish potassium levels
reduce cholesterol levels
reduce adverse hormones and reactions that occur in your body that can make the heart weaker
These medications can include:
blood thinners
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)
beta-blockers
calcium channel blockers
cholesterol-lowering medications
nitrates
angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI)
sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors
hydralazine
ivabradine in some cases
verquvo (vericiguat) in some cases
Always speak with your doctor before taking new medications. Some medications are completely off-limits to people with heart failure, including naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) and ibuprofen (Advil, Midol).
Surgery
Bypass surgery
Some people with heart failure will need surgery, such as coronary bypass surgery. During this surgery, your surgeon will take a healthy piece of an artery or vein and attach it to the blocked coronary artery. This allows the blood to bypass the blocked, damaged artery and flow through the new one.
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
Your doctor may also suggest a procedure known as a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In this procedure, a catheter with a small balloon attached is inserted into the blocked or narrowed artery. Once the catheter reaches the damaged artery, your surgeon inflates a balloon to open the artery.
Your surgeon may need to place a permanent stent, or wire mesh tube, into the blocked or narrowed artery. A stent permanently holds your artery open and can help prevent further narrowing of the artery.
Pacemakers
Other people with heart failure will need pacemakers to help control heart rhythms. These small devices are placed into the chest. They can slow your heart rate when the heart is beating too quickly or increase your heart rate if the heart is beating too slowly. Pacemakers are often used along with bypass surgery as well as medications.
Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
An ICD is a battery-powered device that keeps track of your heart rate and will shock your heart if it detects an abnormal heart rhythm. This shock restores the heart rate back to a normal rhythm. An ICD is suggested for people with an ejection fraction (how much blood your heart pumps out with each contraction) less than 35 percent (if not due to blockages) and <30 percent if due to blockages.
Transplant surgery
Heart transplants are used in the final stages of heart failure when all other treatments have failed. During a transplant, your surgeon removes all or part of your heart and replaces it with a heart from a donor."
congestive heart failure,"for congestive heart failure, how can you prevent heart failure??","Some lifestyle measures can help treat heart failure and prevent the condition from developing. Maintaining a moderate weight and exercising regularly can significantly decrease your risk of heart failure. Reducing the amount of salt in your diet can also lower your risk.
Other habits that may prevent heart failure include:
limiting alcohol intake
not smoking
avoiding high fat foods
getting the right amount of sleep
staying active"
congestive heart failure,"for congestive heart failure, what are the complications of heart failure??","Untreated heart failure can eventually lead to congestive heart failure (CHF), a condition in which blood builds up in other areas of your body. In this potential life threatening condition, you may experience fluid retention in your limbs as well as in your organs, such as the liver and lungs.
Additional complications of heart failure can include:
stroke
thromboembolism
arrhythmias, like atrial fibrillation
kidney dysfunction
Heart attack
A heart attack may also occur because of a complication related to heart failure.
Call 911 or your local emergency services right away if you have these symptoms:
crushing chest pain
discomfort in the chest, such as squeezing or tightness
discomfort in the upper body, including numbness or a coldness
fatigue
dizziness
rapid heart rate
vomiting
nausea
cold sweats"
congestive heart failure,"for congestive heart failure, the bottom line?","Heart failure is usually a long-term condition that requires ongoing treatment to prevent complications. When heart failure is left untreated, the heart can weaken so severely that it causes a life threatening complication.
It�s important to recognize that heart failure can happen to anyone. It�s important to take lifelong preventive measures for your heart health. Always contact your doctor if you suddenly have any new or unexplained symptoms that may indicate a problem with your heart.
Because heart failure is most often a chronic condition, your symptoms will likely get worse over time. Medications and surgeries can help relieve your symptoms, but such treatments may not help if you have a severe case of heart failure. In some cases, heart failure can be life threatening.
The outlook and treatment of heart failure varies depending on the type of heart failure you have. Early treatment is key in preventing the most serious cases of heart failure."
stroke,what is stroke? Tell me about stroke? What kind of disease is stroke? Can you elaborate on stroke? What can you tell me about stroke? Could you describe what stroke is? I�d like to know more about stroke. Can you help? What information do you have on stroke? Could you provide information on stroke?,"Recognizing stroke symptoms and seeking treatment quickly can lead to a better outcome. Symptoms can come on without warning and may include facial drooping, weakness or paralysis, and slurred speech."
stroke,"for stroke, what is a stroke??","A stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures and bleeds, or when there�s a blockage in the blood supply to the brain. The rupture or blockage prevents blood and oxygen from reaching the brain�s tissues.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
, stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States. Every year, more than 795,000 U.S. people have a stroke.
Without oxygen, brain cells and tissue become damaged and begin to die within minutes.
There are three primary types of strokes:
Transient ischemic attack (TIA) involves a blood clot that typically reverses on its own.
Ischemic stroke involves a blockage caused by either a clot or plaque in the artery. The symptoms and complications of ischemic stroke can last longer than those of a TIA, or may become permanent.
Hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either a burst or leaking blood vessel that seeps into the brain."
stroke,"for stroke, stroke symptoms?","The loss of blood flow to the brain damages tissues within the brain. Symptoms of a stroke show up in the body parts controlled by the damaged areas of the brain.
The sooner a person having a stroke gets care, the better their outcome is likely to be. For this reason, it�s helpful to know the signs of a stroke so you can act quickly. Stroke symptoms can include:
paralysis
numbness or weakness in the arm, face, and leg, especially on one side of the body
trouble speaking or understanding others
slurred speech
confusion, disorientation, or lack of responsiveness
sudden behavioral changes, especially increased agitation
vision problems, such as trouble seeing in one or both eyes with vision blackened or blurred, or double vision
trouble walking
loss of balance or coordination
dizziness
severe, sudden headache with an unknown cause
seizures
nausea or vomiting
A stroke requires immediate medical attention. If you think you or someone else is having a stroke, call 911 or local emergency services right away. Prompt treatment is key to preventing the following outcomes:
brain damage
long-term disability
death
It�s better to be overly cautious when dealing with a stroke, so don�t be afraid to get emergency medical help if you think you recognize the signs of a stroke."
stroke,"for stroke, what causes a stroke??","The cause of a stroke depends on the type of stroke. Strokes fall into three main categories:
transient ischemic attack (TIA)
ischemic stroke
hemorrhagic stroke
Illustration by Bailey Mariner
These categories can be further broken down into other types of strokes, including:
embolic stroke
thrombotic stroke
intracerebral stroke
subarachnoid stroke
The type of stroke you have affects your treatment and recovery process.
Ischemic stroke
During an ischemic stroke, the arteries supplying blood to the brain narrow or become blocked. Blood clots or severely reduced blow flow to the brain causes these blockages. Pieces of plaque breaking off and blocking a blood vessel can also cause them.
There are two types of blockages
that can lead to ischemic stroke: a cerebral embolism and cerebral thrombosis.
A cerebral embolism (often referred to as embolic stroke) occurs when a blood clot forms in another part of the body � often the heart or arteries in the upper chest and neck � and moves through the bloodstream until it hits an artery too narrow to let it pass.
The clot gets stuck, and stops the flow of blood and causes a stroke.
Cerebral thrombosis (often referred to as thrombotic stoke) occurs when a blood clot develops at the fatty plaque within the blood vessel.
According to the CDC, 87 percent
of strokes are ischemic strokes.
Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
A transient ischemic attack, often called a TIA or ministroke, occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked temporarily.
Symptoms are similar to those of a full stroke. However, they�re typically temporary and disappear after a few minutes or hours, when the blockage moves and blood flow is restored.
A blood clot usually causes a TIA. While it�s not technically categorized as a full stroke, a TIA serves as a warning that an actual stroke may happen. Because of this, it�s best not to ignore it. Seek the same treatment you would for a major stroke and get emergency medical help.
According to the CDC
, more than one-third of people who experience a TIA and don�t get treatment have a major stroke within a year. Up to 10 to 15 percent of people who experience a TIA have a major stroke within 3 months.
Hemorrhagic stroke
A hemorrhagic stroke happens when an artery in the brain breaks open or leaks blood. The blood from that artery creates excess pressure in the skull and swells the brain, damaging brain cells and tissues.
The two types of hemorrhagic strokes are intracerebral and subarachnoid:
An intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke is the most common type of hemorrhagic stroke. It happens when the tissues surrounding the brain fill with blood after an artery bursts.
A subarachnoid hemorrhagic stroke is less common. It causes bleeding in the area between the brain and the tissues that cover it.
According to the American Heart Association, about 13 percent
of strokes are hemorrhagic."
stroke,"for stroke, risk factors for stroke?","Certain risk factors make you more susceptible to stroke. According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
, risk factors for stroke include:
Diet
An unbalanced diet can increase the risk of stroke. This type of diet is high in:
salt
saturated fats
trans fats
cholesterol
Inactivity
Inactivity, or lack of exercise, can also raise the risk of stroke.
Regular exercise has a number of health benefits. The CDC recommends that adults get at least 2.5 hours
of aerobic exercise every week. This can mean simply a brisk walk a few times a week.
Heavy alcohol use
The risk of stroke also increases with heavy alcohol use.
If you drink, drink in moderation. This means no more than one drink a day for women, and no more than two drinks a day for men.
Heavy alcohol use can raise blood pressure levels. It can also raise triglyceride levels, which can cause atherosclerosis. This is plaque buildup in the arteries that narrows blood vessels.
Tobacco use
Using tobacco in any form also raises the risk of stroke, since it can damage the blood vessels and heart. Nicotine also raises blood pressure.
Personal background
There are some risk factors for stroke you can�t control, such as:
Family history. Stroke risk is higher in some families because of genetic health factors, such as high blood pressure.
Sex. According to the CDC
, while both women and men can have strokes, they�re more common in women than in men in all age groups.
Age. The older you are, the more likely you are to have a stroke.
Race and ethnicity. African Americans, Alaska Natives, and American Indians are more likely to have a stroke than other racial groups.
Health history
Certain medical conditions are linked to stroke risk. These include:
a previous stroke or TIA
high blood pressure
high cholesterol
carrying too much excess weight
heart disorders, such as coronary artery disease
heart valve defects
enlarged heart chambers and irregular heartbeats
sickle cell disease
diabetes
blood clotting disorder
patent foramen ovale (PFO)
To find out about your specific risk factors for stroke, talk with your doctor."
stroke,"for stroke, complications?","The complications after stroke
can vary. They may occur because of either a direct injury to the brain during the stroke, or because abilities have been permanently affected.
Some of these complications include:
seizures
loss of bladder and bowel control
cognitive impairment, including dementia
reduced mobility, range of motion, or ability to control certain muscle movements
depression
mood or emotional changes
shoulder pain
bed sores
sensory or sensation changes
These complications can be managed by methods such as:
medication
physical therapy
counseling
Certain complications may even be reserved."
stroke,"for stroke, how to prevent a stroke?","Lifestyle changes can�t prevent all strokes. But many of these changes can make a radical difference when it comes to lowering your risk of stroke.
These changes include the following:
Quit smoking. If you smoke, quitting now will lower your risk of stroke. You can reach out to your doctor to create a quit plan.
Limit alcohol use. Heavy alcohol consumption can raise your blood pressure, which in turn raises the risk of stroke. If reducing your intake is difficult, reach out to your doctor for help.
Keep a moderate weight. Overweight and obesity increases the risk of stroke. To help manage your weight, eat a balanced diet and stay physically active more often than not. Both steps can also reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
Get regular checkups. Talk with your doctor about how often to get a checkup for blood pressure, cholesterol, and any conditions you may have. They can also support you in making these lifestyle changes and offer guidance.
Taking all these measures will help put you in better shape to prevent stroke.

stroke,"for stroke, diagnosis of stroke?","Your doctor will ask you or a family member about your symptoms and what you were doing when they arose. They�ll take your medical history to find out your stroke risk factors. They�ll also:
ask what medications you take
check your blood pressure
listen to your heart
You�ll also have a physical exam, during which your doctor will evaluate you for:
balance
coordination
weakness
numbness in your arms, face, or legs
signs of confusion
vision issues
Your doctor will then do certain tests to help confirm a stroke diagnosis. These tests can help them determine whether you had a stroke and, if so:
what may have caused it
what part of the brain is affected
whether you have bleeding in the brain"
stroke,"for stroke, tests to diagnose stroke?","Your doctor may order various tests to further help them determine whether you�ve had a stroke, or to rule out another condition. These tests include:
Blood tests
Your doctor might draw blood for several blood tests. Blood tests can determine:
blood sugar levels
whether you have an infection
platelet counts
how fast your blood clots
cholesterol levels
MRI and CT scan
Your doctor may order may an MRI scan, CT scan, or both.
An MRI can help see whether any brain tissue or brain cells have been damaged.
A CT scan can provide a detailed and clear picture of your brain, which can show any bleeding or damage. It may also show other brain conditions that could be causing your symptoms.
EKG
An electrocardiogram (EKG) is a simple test that records the electrical activity in the heart, measuring its rhythm and recording how fast it beats.
An EKG can determine whether you have any heart conditions that may have led to a stroke, such as a prior heart attack or atrial fibrillation.
Cerebral angiogram
A cerebral angiogram offers a detailed look at the arteries in your neck and brain. The test can show blockages or clots that may have caused symptoms.
Carotid ultrasound
A carotid ultrasound, also called a carotid duplex scan, can show fatty deposits (plaque) in your carotid arteries, which supply the blood to your face, neck, and brain.
It can also show whether your carotid arteries have been narrowed or blocked.
Echocardiogram
An echocardiogram can find sources of clots in your heart. These clots may have traveled to your brain and caused a stroke."
stroke,"for stroke, stroke treatment?","Proper medical evaluation and prompt treatment are vital to recovering from a stroke. According to the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association, �Time lost is brain lost.�
Call 911 or local emergency services as soon as you realize you may be having a stroke, or if you suspect someone else is having a stroke.
Treatment for stroke depends on the type of stroke:
Ischemic stroke and TIA
Since a blood clot or blockage in the brain causes these stroke types, they�re largely treated with similar techniques. They can include:
Clot-breaking drugs
Thrombolytic drugs can break up blood clots in your brain�s arteries, which will stop the stroke and reduce damage to the brain.
One such drug, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), or Alteplase IV r-tPA, is considered the gold standard
in ischemic stroke treatment.
This drug works by dissolving blood clots quickly.
People who receive a tPA injection are more likely to recover from a stroke and less likely to have any lasting disability as a result of the stroke.
Mechanical thrombectomy
During this procedure, a doctor inserts a catheter into a large blood vessel inside your head. They then use a device to pull the clot out of the vessel. This surgery is most successful if it�s performed 6 to 24 hours
after the stroke begins.
Stents
If a doctor finds where artery walls have weakened, they may perform a procedure to inflate the narrowed artery and support the walls of the artery with a stent.
Surgery
In the rare instances that other treatments don�t work, surgery can remove a blood clot and plaques from your arteries.
This surgery may be done with a catheter. If the clot is especially large, a surgeon may open an artery to remove the blockage.
Hemorrhagic stroke
Strokes caused by bleeds or leaks in the brain require different treatment strategies. Treatments for hemorrhagic stroke include:
Medications
Unlike with an ischemic stroke, if you�re having a hemorrhagic stroke, the treatment goal is to make your blood clot. Therefore, you may be given medication to counteract any blood thinners you take.
You may also be prescribed drugs that can:
reduce blood pressure
lower the pressure in your brain
prevent seizures
prevent blood vessel constriction
Coiling
During this procedure, your doctor guides a long tube to the area of hemorrhage or weakened blood vessel. They then install a coil-like device in the area where the artery wall is weak. This blocks blood flow to the area, reducing bleeding.
Clamping
During imaging tests, your doctor may discover an aneurysm that hasn�t started bleeding yet or has stopped.
To prevent additional bleeding, a surgeon may place a tiny clamp at the base of the aneurysm. This cuts off blood supply and prevents a possible broken blood vessel or new bleeding.
Surgery
If your doctor sees that an aneurysm has burst, they may do surgery to clip the aneurysm and prevent additional bleeding. Likewise, a craniotomy may be needed to relieve the pressure on the brain after a large stroke.
In addition to emergency treatment, your healthcare team will advise you on ways to prevent future strokes."
stroke,"for stroke, stroke medications?","Several medications are used to treat strokes. The type your doctor prescribes depends largely on the type of stroke you had.
The goal of some medications is to prevent a second stroke, while others aim to prevent a stroke from happening in the first place.
Your doctor may prescribe one or more of these medications to treat or prevent a stroke, depending on factors such as your health history and your risks.
The most common stroke medications include:
Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs)
This newer drug class
works in the same way as traditional anticoagulants (reducing your blood�s ability to clot), but they often work faster and require less monitoring.
If taken for stroke prevention, DOACs may also reduce the risk of brain bleed.
Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)
This emergency medication can be given during a stroke to break up the blood clot causing the stroke. It�s the only medication currently available that can do this, but it must be given within 3 to 4.5 hours after symptoms of a stroke begin.
This drug is injected into a blood vessel so the medication can start to work as quickly as possible, which reduces the risk of complications from the stroke.
Anticoagulants
These drugs reduce your blood�s ability to clot. The most common anticoagulant is warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven).
These drugs can also prevent existing blood clots from growing larger, which is why doctors may prescribe them to prevent a stroke, or after an ischemic stroke or TIA has occurred.
Antiplatelet drugs
These medications prevent blood clots by making it more difficult for the blood�s platelets to stick together. The most common antiplatelet drugs include aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix).
The drugs can prevent ischemic strokes. They�re especially important in preventing secondary stroke.
If you�ve never had a stroke before, only use aspirin as a preventive medication if you have a high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart attack and stroke) and a low risk of bleeding.
Statins
Statins help lower high blood cholesterol levels. They�re among the most commonly prescribed
medications in the United States.
These drugs prevent the production of an enzyme that can turn cholesterol into plaque � the thick, sticky substance that can build up on the walls of arteries and cause strokes and heart attacks.
Common statins include:
rosuvastatin (Crestor)
simvastatin (Zocor)
atorvastatin (Lipitor)
Blood pressure drugs
High blood pressure can cause pieces of plaque buildup in your arteries to break off. These pieces can block arteries, causing a stroke.
As a result, managing high blood pressure with medication, lifestyle changes, or both can help prevent a stroke."
stroke,"for stroke, recovering from a stroke?","Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability in the United States.
However, the American Stroke Association
reports that 10 percent of stroke survivors make an almost complete recovery, while another 25 percent recover with only minor issues.
It�s important that recovery and rehabilitation from a stroke start as soon as possible. In fact, stroke recovery should begin in the hospital.
In a hospital, a care team can stabilize your condition and assess the effects of the stroke. They can identify underlying factors and begin therapy to help you regain some of your affected skills.
Stroke recovery typically focuses on four main areas:
Speech therapy
A stroke can cause speech and language impairment. A speech and language therapist will work with you to relearn how to speak.
Or, if you find verbal communication difficult after a stroke, they�ll help you find new ways of communication.
Cognitive therapy
After a stroke, many people may have changes to their thinking and reasoning skills. This can cause behavioral and mood changes.
An occupational therapist can help you work to regain your former patterns of thinking and behavior, and to manage your emotional responses.
Relearning sensory skills
If the part of your brain that relays sensory signals is affected during the stroke, you may find that your senses are �dulled� or no longer working.
That may mean that you don�t feel things well, such as temperature, pressure, or pain. An occupational therapist can help you learn to adjust to this lack of sensation.
Physical therapy
Muscle tone and strength may be weakened by a stroke, and you may find you�re unable to move your body as well as you could before.
A physical therapist will work with you to regain your strength and balance, and find ways to adjust to any limitations.
Rehabilitation may take place in a clinic, skilled nursing home, or your own home."
stroke,"for stroke, the takeaway?","If you suspect you may be experiencing symptoms of a stroke, it�s vital that you seek emergency medical treatment as soon as possible.
Clot-busting medication can only be provided in the first hours after the signs of a stroke begin. Early treatment is one of the most effective ways to reduce your risk of long-term complications and disability.
While it�s not always possible to completely prevent a stroke, certain lifestyle changes can greatly reduce your risk. Medications can also help reduce the risk of blood clots, which can lead to stroke.
If your doctor believes you might be at risk for a stroke, they will work with you to find a prevention strategy that works for you, including medical intervention and lifestyle changes."

What can you tell me about high cholesterol? Could you describe what high cholesterol is? I�d like to know more about high cholesterol. Can you help? What information do you have on high cholesterol? Could you provide information on high cholesterol?,"Causes of high cholesterol include diet, smoking, and genetics. High cholesterol rarely causes symptoms, so it�s important to have routine cholesterol screenings if you�re at risk.
High cholesterol is a pretty common issue in the U.S. In fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
, nearly 94 million U.S. adults ages 20 or older have what could be considered borderline high cholesterol.
However, because this condition can often present without any real symptoms, you may not even know you have it until you visit your doctor.
If you�re wondering what causes high cholesterol, what to do if you�ve been diagnosed with it, and if there are ways to reverse it (hint: there are), read on for all the answers."
high cholesterol,"for high cholesterol, what is cholesterol??","Cholesterol is a type of lipid. It�s a waxy, fat-like substance that your liver produces naturally. It�s vital for the formation of cell membranes, certain hormones, and vitamin D.
Cholesterol doesn�t dissolve in water, so it can�t travel through your blood on its own. To help transport cholesterol, your liver produces lipoproteins.
Lipoproteins are particles made from fat and protein. They carry cholesterol and triglycerides, another type of lipid, through your bloodstream. The two major forms of lipoprotein are low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL).
LDL cholesterol is any cholesterol carried by low-density lipoproteins. If your blood contains too much LDL cholesterol, you may be diagnosed with high cholesterol. Without treatment, high cholesterol may lead to many health issues, including heart attack and stroke.
High cholesterol rarely causes symptoms in the beginning. That�s why it�s important to get your cholesterol levels checked on a regular basis."
high cholesterol,"for high cholesterol, high cholesterol symptoms?","In most cases, high cholesterol is a �silent� condition. It typically doesn�t cause any symptoms. Many people don�t even realize they have high cholesterol until they develop serious complications, such as a heart attack or stroke.
That�s why routine cholesterol screening is important. If you�re 20 years or older, ask your doctor if you should have routine cholesterol screening. Learn how this screening could potentially save your life."
high cholesterol,"for high cholesterol, causes of high cholesterol?","Eating too many foods that are high in cholesterol, saturated fats, and trans fats may increase your risk of developing high cholesterol. Living with obesity can also increase your risk. Other lifestyle factors that can contribute to high cholesterol include inactivity and smoking.
Your genetics can also affect your chances of developing high cholesterol. Genes are passed down from parents to children. Certain genes instruct your body on how to process cholesterol and fats. If your parents have high cholesterol, you may be at a greater risk of having it too.
In rare cases, high cholesterol is caused by familial hypercholesterolemia. This genetic disorder prevents your body from removing LDL. According to the National Human Genome Research Institute
, most adults with this condition have total cholesterol levels above 300 milligrams per deciliter and LDL levels above 200 milligrams per deciliter.
Other health conditions, such as diabetes and hypothyroidism, may also increase your risk of developing high cholesterol and related complications."
high cholesterol,"for high cholesterol, ldl cholesterol, or �bad cholesterol�?","LDL cholesterol is often called �bad cholesterol.� It carries cholesterol to your arteries. If your levels of LDL cholesterol are too high, it can build up on the walls of your arteries.
This buildup is also known as cholesterol plaque. This plaque can narrow your arteries, limit your blood flow, and raise your risk of blood clots. If a blood clot blocks an artery in your heart or brain, it can cause a heart attack or stroke."
high cholesterol,"for high cholesterol, hdl cholesterol, or �good cholesterol�?","HDL cholesterol is sometimes called �good cholesterol.� It helps return LDL cholesterol to your liver to be removed from your body. This helps prevent cholesterol plaque from building up in your arteries.
When you have healthy levels of HDL cholesterol, it can help lower your risk of blood clots, heart disease, and stroke."
high cholesterol,"for high cholesterol, triglycerides, a different type of lipid?","Triglycerides are another type of lipid. They�re different from cholesterol. While your body uses cholesterol to build cells and certain hormones, it uses triglycerides as a source of energy.
When you eat more calories than your body can use right away, it converts those calories into triglycerides. It stores triglycerides in your fat cells. It also uses lipoproteins to circulate triglycerides through your bloodstream.
If you regularly eat more calories than your body can use, your triglyceride levels may become too high. This can raise your risk of several health problems, including heart disease and stroke.
Your doctor can use a simple blood test to measure your triglyceride level, as well as your cholesterol levels."
high cholesterol,"for high cholesterol, getting your cholesterol levels checked?","If you�re 20 years or older, the American Heart Association
recommends getting your cholesterol levels checked at least once every 4 to 6 years. If you have a history of high cholesterol or other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, your doctor may encourage you to get your cholesterol levels tested more often.
Your doctor can use a lipid panel to measure your total cholesterol level, as well your LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. Your total cholesterol level is the overall amount of cholesterol in your blood. It includes LDL and HDL cholesterol.
If your levels of total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol are too high, your doctor may diagnose you with high cholesterol. High cholesterol can be dangerous when your LDL levels are too high and your HDL levels are too low.

Cholesterol levels chart
Being diagnosed with high cholesterol doesn�t automatically mean you will be put on medication. If your doctor does prescribe you medication, different factors may influence the type of medication they recommend.
With this in mind, most physicians use generalized measurements to decide on treatment plans. They may categorize these measurements as desirable, borderline high, or high cholesterol.
According to the National Library of Medicine, the total cholesterol of most adults can be categorized as:
Total cholesterol Category
less than 200 mg/dL desirable
200-239 mg/dL borderline high
240 mg/dL and above high
The National Library of Medicine also provides optimal to high categories of LDL (�bad�) cholesterol levels:
LDL (�bad�) cholesterol levels Category
less than 100 mg/dL optimal
100-129 mg/dL near optimal
130-159 mg/dL borderline high
160-189 mg/dL high
190 mg/dL and above very high
Again, these measurements are general. You and your doctor will consider other personal factors before deciding on a treatment plan."
high cholesterol,"for high cholesterol, recent guidelines for healthy cholesterol levels?","Your body needs some cholesterol to function properly, including some LDL. But if your LDL levels are too high, it can raise your risk of serious health problems.
In 2018, the American College of Cardiologists and the American Heart Association updated their recommendations for the treatment of high cholesterol
.
Under the new guidelines, in addition to your cholesterol levels, treatment recommendations analyze other risk factors for heart disease, such as family history and other health issues. The guidelines use all these factors to consider a person�s overall chance of developing complications during the next 10 years."
high cholesterol,"for high cholesterol, risk factors for high cholesterol?","You may be at a higher risk of developing high cholesterol if you:
are living with obesity
consume a lot of saturated and trans fats, like those found in fast food
have limited physical activity
smoke tobacco products
have a family history of high cholesterol
have diabetes, kidney disease, or hypothyroidism
People of all ages, genders, and ethnicities can have high cholesterol."
high cholesterol,"for high cholesterol, complications of high cholesterol?","Without treatment, high cholesterol can cause plaque to build up in your arteries. Over time, this plaque can narrow your arteries. This condition is known as atherosclerosis.
Atherosclerosis is a serious condition. It can limit the flow of blood through your arteries. It also raises your risk of developing dangerous blood clots.
Atherosclerosis can result in many life threatening complications, such as:
stroke
heart attack
angina, or chest pain
high blood pressure
peripheral vascular disease
chronic kidney disease
High cholesterol can also create a bile imbalance, raising your risk of gallstones. See the other ways that high cholesterol can impact your body."
high cholesterol,"for high cholesterol, how to lower cholesterol?","If you have high cholesterol, your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes to help lower it. For instance, they may recommend changes to your diet, exercise habits, or other aspects of your daily routine. If you smoke, they will likely advise you to quit.
Your doctor may also prescribe medications or other treatments to help lower your cholesterol levels. In some cases, they may refer you to a specialist for more care.
Lowering cholesterol through diet
To help you achieve and maintain healthy cholesterol levels, your doctor may recommend changes to your diet.
For example, they may advise you to:
limit your intake of foods that are high in cholesterol, saturated fats, and trans fats
choose lean sources of protein, such as chicken, fish, and legumes
eat a wide variety of high fiber foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains
opt for baked, broiled, steamed, grilled, and roasted foods instead of fried foods
avoid fast food and sugary, pre-packaged options when possible
Foods that are high in cholesterol, saturated fats, or trans fats include:
red meat, organ meats, egg yolks, and high fat dairy products
processed foods made with cocoa butter or palm oil
deep-fried foods, such as potato chips, onion rings, and fried chicken
certain baked goods, such as some cookies and muffins
Eating fish and other foods that contain omega-3 fatty acids may also help lower your LDL levels. For example, salmon, mackerel, and herring are rich sources of omega-3s. Walnuts, almonds, ground flaxseeds, and avocados also contain omega-3s.
Cholesterol medications
In some cases, your doctor might prescribe medications to help lower your cholesterol levels.
Statins are the most commonly prescribed medications for high cholesterol. They block your liver from producing more cholesterol.
Examples of statins include:
atorvastatin (Lipitor)
fluvastatin (Lescol)
rosuvastatin (Crestor)
simvastatin (Zocor)
Your doctor may also prescribe other medications for high cholesterol, such as:
niacin
bile acid resins or sequestrants, such as colesevalam (Welchol), colestipol (Colestid), or cholestyramine (Prevalite)
cholesterol absorption inhibitors, such as ezetimibe (Zetia)
PCSK9 inhibitors, such as alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha)
Some products contain a combination of drugs to help decrease your body�s absorption of cholesterol from foods and reduce your liver�s production of cholesterol. One example is a combination of ezetimibe and simvastatin (Vytorin). Learn more about the drugs used to treat high cholesterol.
Home remedies to lower cholesterol naturally
In some cases, you may be able to lower your cholesterol levels without taking medications. For example, it may be enough to eat a nutritious diet, exercise regularly, and avoid smoking tobacco products.
Some people also claim that certain herbal and nutritional supplements may help lower cholesterol levels. For instance, claims have been made about:
garlic
hawthorn
astragalus
red yeast rice
plant sterol and stanol supplements
blond psyllium, found in psyllium seed husk
ground flaxseed
However, the level of evidence supporting these claims varies. Also, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hasn�t approved any of these products for treating high cholesterol. More research is needed to learn if they can help treat this condition.
Always talk with your doctor before taking any herbal or nutritional supplements. In some cases, they might interact with other medications you�re taking."
high cholesterol,"for high cholesterol, how to prevent high cholesterol?","You can�t control the genetic risk factors for high cholesterol. However, lifestyle factors can be managed.
To lower your risk of developing high cholesterol:
Eat a nutritious diet that�s low in cholesterol and animal fats, and high in fiber.
Avoid excessive alcohol consumption.
Maintain a moderate weight.
E.xercise regularly.
Avoid smoking.
Follow your doctor�s recommendations for routine cholesterol screening. If you�re at risk of high cholesterol or coronary heart disease, they will likely encourage you to get your cholesterol levels tested on a regular basis."
high cholesterol,"for high cholesterol, takeaway?","In most cases, high cholesterol has no symptoms. But without treatment, high cholesterol can cause serious health issues. The good news is that your doctor can help you manage this condition, and in many cases, can help you avoid complications.
To learn if you have high cholesterol, ask your doctor to test your cholesterol levels, especially if you�re 20 years or older. If they diagnose you with high cholesterol, ask them about your treatment options.
To lower your risk of complications from high cholesterol, practice healthy lifestyle habits and follow your doctor�s recommended treatment plan.
Eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding tobacco products may help you achieve and maintain healthy cholesterol levels. It could also help lower your risk of complications from high cholesterol."

What can you tell me about infectious disease? Could you describe what infectious disease is? I�d like to know more about infectious disease. Can you help? What information do you have on infectious disease? Could you provide information on infectious disease?,"What is acute respiratory infection?
Acute respiratory infection is an infection that may interfere with normal breathing. It can affect just your upper respiratory system, which starts at your sinuses and ends at your vocal chords, or just your lower respiratory system, which starts at your vocal chords and ends at your lungs.
This infection is particularly dangerous for children, older adults, and people with immune system disorders."
infectious disease,"for infectious disease, what are the symptoms of acute respiratory infection??","The symptoms you experience will be different if it�s a lower or upper respiratory infection. Symptoms can include:
congestion, either in the nasal sinuses or lungs
runny nose
cough
sore throat
body aches
fatigue
Call your doctor if you experience:
a fever over 103�F (39�C) and chills
difficulty breathing
dizziness
loss of consciousness"
infectious disease,"for infectious disease, what causes acute respiratory infection??","There are several different causes of acute respiratory infection.
Causes of upper respiratory infection:
acute pharyngitis
acute ear infection
common cold
Causes of lower respiratory infection:
bronchitis
pneumonia
bronchiolitis"
infectious disease,"for infectious disease, who is at risk for acute respiratory infection??","It�s almost impossible to avoid viruses and bacteria, but certain risk factors increase your chances of developing acute respiratory infection.
The immune systems of children and older adults are more prone to being affected by viruses.
Children are especially at risk because of their constant contact with other kids who could be virus carriers. Children often don�t wash their hands regularly. They are also more likely to rub their eyes and put their fingers in their mouths, resulting in the spread of viruses.
People with heart disease or other lung problems are more likely to contract an acute respiratory infection. Anyone whose immune system might be weakened by another disease is at risk. Smokers also are at high risk and have more trouble recovering."
infectious disease,"for infectious disease, how is acute respiratory infection diagnosed??","In a respiratory exam, the doctor focuses on your breathing. They will check for fluid and inflammation in the lungs by listening for abnormal sounds in your lungs when you breathe. The doctor may peer into your nose and ears, and check your throat.
If your doctor believes the infection is in the lower respiratory tract, an X-ray or CT scan may be necessary to check the condition of the lungs.
Lung function tests have been useful as diagnostic tools. Pulse oximetry, also known as pulse ox, can check how much oxygen gets into the lungs. A doctor may also take a swab from your nose or mouth, or ask you to cough up a sample of sputum (material coughed up from the lungs) to check for the type of virus or bacteria causing the disease."
infectious disease,"for infectious disease, how is acute respiratory infection treated??","With many viruses, there are no known treatments. Your doctor may prescribe medications to manage your symptoms while monitoring your condition. If your doctor suspects a bacterial infection, they may prescribe antibiotics."
infectious disease,"for infectious disease, what are potential complications of acute respiratory infection??","Complications of acute respiratory infection are extremely serious and can result in permanent damage and even death. They include:
respiratory arrest, which occurs when the lungs stop functioning
respiratory failure, a rise in CO2 in your blood caused by your lungs not functioning correctly
congestive heart failure"
infectious disease,"for infectious disease, preventing acute respiratory infection?","Most causes of an acute respiratory infection aren�t treatable. Therefore, prevention is the best method to ward off harmful respiratory infections.
Getting the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) and pertussis vaccine will substantially lower your risk of getting a respiratory infection. You may also benefit from influenza vaccination and pneumovax. Talk to your doctor about getting these.
Practice good hygiene:
Wash your hands frequently, especially after you�ve been in a public place.
Always sneeze into the arm of your shirt or in a tissue. Although this may not ease your own symptoms, it will prevent you from spreading infectious diseases.
Avoid touching your face, especially your eyes and mouth, to prevent introducing germs into your system.
Was this helpful?
You should also avoid smoking and make sure you include plenty of vitamins in your diet, such as vitamin C, which helps boost your immune system. Vitamin C is maintained in immune cells, and a deficiency has been linked to higher susceptibility to infection. While research is unclear if Vitamin C can prevent an acute respiratory infection, there is evidence that it can shorten the length of time and or severity of some infections."
COPD,what is COPD? Tell me about COPD? What kind of disease is COPD? Can you elaborate on COPD? What can you tell me about COPD? Could you describe what COPD is? I�d like to know more about COPD. Can you help? What information do you have on COPD? Could you provide information on COPD?,COPD is a disease that damages your lungs over time. It may start with mild symptoms and then get worse. Treatment can help symptoms and slow disease progression.
COPD,"for COPD, what is copd??","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, commonly referred to as COPD, is a group of progressive lung diseases.
The most common of these diseases are emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Many people with COPD have both of these conditions.
Emphysema slowly destroys air sacs in your lungs, which interferes with outward air flow. Bronchitis causes inflammation and narrowing of the bronchial tubes, which allows mucus to build up.
It�s estimated that about 30 million people in the United States have COPD. As many as half are unaware that they have it.
Untreated, COPD can lead to a faster progression of disease, heart problems, and worsening respiratory infections."
COPD,"for COPD, what are the symptoms of copd??","COPD makes it harder to breathe. Symptoms may be mild at first, beginning with intermittent coughing and shortness of breath. As it progresses, symptoms can become more constant to where it can become increasingly difficult to breathe.
You may experience wheezing and tightness in the chest or have excess sputum production. Some people with COPD have acute exacerbations, which are flare-ups of severe symptoms.
Early symptoms
At first, symptoms of COPD can be quite mild. You might mistake them for a cold.
Early symptoms include:
occasional shortness of breath, especially after exercise
mild but recurrent cough
needing to clear your throat often, especially first thing in the morning
You might start making subtle changes, such as avoiding stairs and skipping physical activities.
Worsening symptoms
Symptoms can get progressively worse and harder to ignore. As the lungs become more damaged, you may experience:
shortness of breath, after even mild forms of exercise like walking up a flight of stairs
wheezing, which is a type of higher-pitched noisy breathing, especially during exhalations
chest tightness
chronic cough, with or without mucus
need to clear mucus from your lungs every day
frequent colds, flu, or other respiratory infections
lack of energy
In later stages of COPD, symptoms may also include:
fatigue
swelling of the feet, ankles, or legs
weight loss
Symptoms are likely to be much worse if you currently smoke or are regularly exposed to secondhand smoke.
Learn more about the symptoms of COPD.
Emergency treatment
Immediate medical care is needed if:
you have bluish or gray fingernails or lips, as this indicates low oxygen levels in your blood
you have trouble catching your breath or can�t talk
you feel confused, muddled, or faint
your heart is racing
Was this helpful?"
COPD,"for COPD, what causes copd??","Most people with COPD are at least 40 years old and have at least some history of smoking. The longer and more tobacco products you smoke, the greater your risk of COPD is.
In addition to cigarette smoke, cigar smoke, pipe smoke, and secondhand smoke can cause COPD. Your risk of COPD is even greater if you have asthma and smoke.
Other causes
You can also develop COPD if you�re exposed to chemicals and fumes in the workplace. Long-term exposure to air pollution and inhaling dust can also cause COPD.
In developing countries, along with tobacco smoke, homes are often poorly ventilated, forcing families to breathe fumes from burning fuel used for cooking and heating.
There may be a genetic predisposition to developing COPD. Up to an estimated 5 percent
of people with COPD have a deficiency in a protein called alpha-1-antitrypsin.
This deficiency causes the lungs to deteriorate and also can affect the liver. There may be other associated genetic factors at play as well."
COPD,"for COPD, diagnosing copd?","There�s no single test for COPD. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, a physical exam, and diagnostic test results.
When you visit the doctor, be sure to mention all of your symptoms. Tell your doctor if:
you�re a smoker or have smoked in the past
you�re exposed to lung irritants on the job
you�re exposed to a lot of secondhand smoke
you have a family history of COPD
you have asthma or other respiratory conditions
you take over-the-counter or prescription medications
Exam and tests
During the physical exam, your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen to your lungs as you breathe. Based on all this information, your doctor may order some of these tests to get a more complete picture:
Spirometry is a noninvasive test to assess lung function. During the test, you�ll take a deep breath and then blow into a tube connected to the spirometer.
Imaging tests, like a chest X-ray or CT scan. These images can provide a detailed look at your lungs, blood vessels, and heart.
An arterial blood gas test. This involves taking a blood sample from an artery to measure your blood oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other important levels.
These tests can help determine if you have COPD or a different condition, such as asthma, a restrictive lung disease, or heart failure.
Learn more about how COPD is diagnosed."
COPD,"for COPD, treatment for copd?","Treatment can ease symptoms, prevent complications, and generally slow disease progression. Your healthcare team may include a lung specialist (pulmonologist) and physical and respiratory therapists.
Oxygen therapy
If your blood oxygen level is too low, you can receive supplemental oxygen through a mask or nasal cannula to help you breathe better. A portable unit can make it easier to get around.
Surgery
Surgery is reserved for severe COPD or when other treatments have failed, which is more likely when you have a form of severe emphysema.
One type of surgery is called bullectomy. During this procedure, surgeons remove large, abnormal air spaces (bullae) from the lungs.
Another is lung volume reduction surgery, which removes damaged upper lung tissue. Lung volume reduction surgery can be effective at improving breathing, but few patients undergo this major, somewhat risky procedure.
Lung transplantation is an option in some cases. Lung transplantation can effectively cure COPD, but has its many risks.
There is a less invasive method of improving the efficiency of airflow in people with severe emphysema called endobronchial valves (EBV), which are one-way valves that divert inspired air to healthy lungs and away from non-functioning, damaged lungs.
In 2018, an EBV device called the Zephyr Endobronchial Valve
was approved by the FDA and has been shown to improve lung function, exercise capacity and quality of life for patients living with emphysema.
Lifestyle changes
Certain lifestyle changes may also help alleviate your symptoms or provide relief.
If you smoke, quit. Your doctor can recommend appropriate products or support services.
Whenever possible, avoid secondhand smoke and chemical fumes.
Get the nutrition your body needs. Work with your doctor or dietician to create a healthy eating plan.
Talk to your doctor about how much exercise is safe for you.
Learn more about the different treatment options for COPD."
COPD,"for COPD, medications for copd?","Medications can reduce symptoms and cut down on flare-ups. It may take some trial and error to find the medication and dosage that works best for you, but these are some of your options:
Inhaled bronchodilators
Medicines called bronchodilators help loosen tight muscles in your airways. They�re typically taken through an inhaler or nebulizer.
Short-acting bronchodilators last from 4 to 6 hours. You only use them when you need them. For ongoing symptoms, there are long-acting versions you can use every day. They last about 12 hours.
For people with COPD who experience shortness of breath or trouble breathing during exercise, the American Thoracic Society strongly recommends a long-acting-beta-agonist (LABA) combined with a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA).
These bronchodilators work by relaxing tightened muscles in the airways, which widens your airways for better air passage. They also help your body clear mucus from the lungs. These two types of bronchodilators can be taken in combination by inhaler or with a nebulizer.

Here�s a list of recommended LABA/LAMA bronchodilator therapies:
aclidinium/formoterol
glycopyrrolate/formoterol
tiotropium/olodaterol
umeclidinium/vilanterol
Corticosteroids
Long-acting bronchodilators are commonly combined with inhaled glucocorticosteroids. A glucocorticosteroid can reduce inflammation in the airways and lower mucus production.
The long-acting bronchodilator can relax the airway muscle to help the airways stay wider. Corticosteroids are also available in pill form.
Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors
This type of medication can be taken in pill form to help reduce inflammation and relax the airways. It�s generally prescribed for severe COPD with chronic bronchitis.
Theophylline
This medication eases chest tightness and shortness of breath. It may also help prevent flare-ups. It�s available in pill form.
Theophylline is an older medication that relaxes the muscle of the airways, and it may cause side effects. It�s generally not a first-line treatment for COPD therapy.
Antibiotics and antivirals
Antibiotics or antivirals may be prescribed when you develop certain respiratory infections.
Vaccines
To lower risk of other respiratory infections, ask your doctor if you should get a yearly flu shot, pneumococcal vaccine, and a tetanus booster that includes protection from pertussis (whooping cough).
Learn more about the drugs and medications used to treat COPD."
COPD,"for COPD, diet recommendations for people with copd?","There�s no specific diet for COPD, but a healthy diet is important for maintaining overall health. The stronger you are, the more able you�ll be to prevent complications and other health problems.
Choose a variety of nutritious foods from these groups:
vegetables
fruits
grains
protein
dairy
Also, remember to go easy on the salt. It causes the body to retain water, which can strain breathing.
Liquids
Drink plenty of fluids. Drinking at least six to eight 8-ounce glasses of non-caffeinated liquids a day can help keep mucus thinner. This may make the mucus easier to cough out.
Limit caffeinated beverages because they can interfere with medications. If you have heart problems, you may need to drink less, so talk to your doctor.
Weight management
Maintaining a healthy weight is important. It takes more energy to breathe when you have COPD, so you might need to take in more calories. But if you�re overweight, your lungs and heart may have to work harder.
If you�re underweight or frail, even basic body maintenance can become difficult. Overall, having COPD weakens your immune system and decreases your ability to fight off infection.
Eating habits
A full stomach makes it harder for your lungs to expand, leaving you short of breath. If you find that this happens to you, try these remedies:
Clear your airways about an hour before a meal.
Take smaller bites of food that you chew slowly before swallowing.
Swap three meals a day for five or six smaller meals.
Save fluids until the end so you feel less full during the meal.
Check out these 5 diet tips for people with COPD."
COPD,"for COPD, living with copd?","COPD requires lifelong disease management. That means following the advice of your healthcare team and maintaining healthy lifestyle habits.
Since your lungs are weakened, you�ll want to avoid anything that might overtax them or cause a flare-up. Here�s a list of things to consider as you adjust your lifestyle.
Avoid smoking. If you�re having trouble quitting, talk to your doctor about smoking cessation programs. Try to avoid secondhand smoke, chemical fumes, air pollution, and dust.
Work out. A little exercise each day can help you stay strong. Talk to your doctor about how much exercise is good for you.
Eat a diet of nutritious foods. Avoid highly processed foods that are loaded with calories and salt, but lack nutrients.
Treating other conditions. If you have other chronic diseases along with COPD, it�s important to manage those as well, particularly diabetes mellitus and heart disease.
Clean house. Clear the clutter and streamline your home so that it takes less energy to clean and do other household tasks. If you have advanced COPD, get help with daily chores.
Be prepared for flare-ups. Carry your emergency contact information with you and post it on your refrigerator. Include information about what medications you take, as well as the doses. Program emergency numbers into your phone.
Find support. It can be a relief to talk to others who understand. Consider joining a support group. The COPD Foundation provides a comprehensive list of organizations and resources for people living with COPD."
COPD,"for COPD, what are the stages of copd??","One measure of COPD is achieved by spirometry grading.
There are different grading systems, and one grading system is part of the GOLD classification. The GOLD classification is used for determining COPD severity and helping to form a prognosis and treatment plan.
There are four GOLD grades based on spirometry testing:
grade 1: mild
grade 2: moderate
grade 3: severe
grade 4: very severe
This is based on the spirometry test result of your FEV1. This is the amount of air you can breathe out of the lungs in the first second of a forced expiration. The severity increases as your FEV1 decreases.
The GOLD classification also takes into account your individual symptoms and history of acute exacerbations. Based on this information, your doctor can assign a letter group to you to help define your COPD grade.
As the disease progresses, you�re more susceptible to complications, such as:
respiratory infections, including common colds, flu, and pneumonia
heart problems
high blood pressure in lung arteries (pulmonary hypertension)
lung cancer
depression and anxiety
Learn more about the different stages of COPD."
COPD,"for COPD, is there a connection between copd and lung cancer??","COPD and lung cancer are major health problems worldwide. These two diseases are linked in a number of ways.
COPD and lung cancer have several common risk factors. Smoking is the number one risk factor for both diseases. Both are more likely if you breathe secondhand smoke, or are exposed to chemicals or other fumes in the workplace.
There may be a genetic predisposition to developing both diseases. Also, the risk of developing either COPD or lung cancer increases with age.
It was estimated in 2009 that between 40 and 70 percent
of people with lung cancer also have COPD. This same 2009 study
concluded that COPD is a risk factor for lung cancer.
A 2015 study
suggests they may actually be different aspects of the same disease, and that COPD could be a driving factor in lung cancer.
In some cases, people don�t learn they have COPD until they�re diagnosed with lung cancer.
However, having COPD doesn�t necessarily mean you�ll get lung cancer. It does mean that you have a higher risk. That�s another reason why, if you smoke, quitting is a good idea.
Learn more about the possible complications of COPD."
COPD,"for COPD, copd statistics?","Worldwide, it�s estimated that about 65 million
people have moderate to severe COPD. About 16 million
adults in the United States have a diagnosis of COPD.
Most people with COPD are 40 years of age or older.
The majority of people with COPD are smokers or former smokers. Smoking is the most important risk factor that can be changed.
In up to 5 percent
of people with COPD, the cause is a genetic disorder involving a deficiency of a protein called alpha-1-antitrypsin.
COPD is a leading cause of hospitalizations in industrialized countries. In the United States, COPD is responsible for a large amount of emergency department visits and hospital admissions.
In the year 2000, it was noted that there were over 700,000 hospital admissions
and approximately 1.5 million
emergency department visits.
COPD is the third leading cause of death in the United States. More women than men die from COPD each year.
It�s projected that the number of patients diagnosed with COPD will increase by more than 150 percent from 2010 to 2030. Much of that can be attributed to an aging population.
Check out more statistics about COPD."
COPD,"for COPD, what�s the outlook for people with copd??","COPD generally reduces life expectancy, though the outlook varies considerably from person to person.
People with COPD who never smoked may have a modest reduction in life expectancy
, while former and current smokers are likely to have a larger reduction.
COPD tends to progress slowly. You may not even know you have it during the early stages.
Once you have a diagnosis, you�ll need to start seeing your doctor on a regular basis. You�ll also have to take steps to manage your condition and make the appropriate changes to your daily life.
Early symptoms can usually be managed, and certain lifestyle choices can help you maintain a good quality of life for some time.
As the disease progresses, symptoms can become increasingly limiting.
People with severe stages of COPD may not be able to care for themselves without assistance. They�re at increased risk of developing respiratory infections, heart problems, and lung cancer. They may also be at risk of depression and anxiety.
Besides smoking, your outlook depends on how well you respond to treatment and whether you can avoid serious complications. Your doctor is in the best position to evaluate your overall health and give you an idea about what to expect.

kidney failure,what is kidney failure? Tell me about kidney failure? What kind of disease is kidney failure? Can you elaborate on kidney failure? What can you tell me about kidney failure? Could you describe what kidney failure is? I�d like to know more about kidney failure. Can you help? What information do you have on kidney failure? Could you provide information on kidney failure?,"Kidney failure occurs when your kidneys lose the ability to filter waste from your blood sufficiently. It may not cause symptoms in the early stages.
Your kidneys filter your blood and remove toxins from your body. These toxins go to your bladder and are eliminated when you urinate. When this doesn�t work properly, you can get kidney failure.
If your kidneys aren�t able to function properly, toxins can overwhelm your body. This can lead to kidney failure, which can be life threatening if left untreated.
Keep reading as we break down everything you need to know about kidney failure, including symptoms, stages, treatment, and the typical outlook."
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, types of kidney failure?","Acute kidney failure occurs when your kidneys suddenly stop working properly while chronic kidney failure occurs over time. Doctors typically divide kidney failure into five types.
The types of kidney failure include:
Acute prerenal kidney failure: Insufficient blood flow to the kidneys can cause acute prerenal kidney failure. Doctors can usually cure this type once they determine the cause of the decreased blood flow.
Acute intrinsic kidney failure: Acute intrinsic kidney failure can result from direct trauma to the kidneys, such as physical impact or an accident, toxin overload, and ischemia, which is a lack of oxygen to the kidneys.
Chronic prerenal kidney failure: When there isn�t enough blood flowing to your kidneys for an extended period of time, the kidneys can shrink and lose the ability to function.
Chronic intrinsic kidney failure: This happens when there�s long-term damage to the kidneys due to intrinsic kidney disease. Intrinsic kidney disease develops from direct trauma to the kidneys, such as severe bleeding or a lack of oxygen.
Chronic post-renal kidney failure: A long-term blockage of the urinary tract prevents urination. This causes pressure and eventual kidney damage.
Acute post-renal kidney failure: This type of kidney failure can occur due to stones or another blockage in the urinary tract."
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, symptoms of kidney failure?","Early-stage kidney failure often doesn�t cause noticeable symptoms. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
, about 90% of people with chronic kidney disease don�t know they have it.
As kidney disease progresses, symptoms may include:
reduced amount of urine
swelling of your legs, ankles, and feet from fluid retention
shortness of breath
trouble sleeping
muscle cramping at night
excessive drowsiness or fatigue
persistent nausea
confusion
chest pain or pressure
seizures
coma
Early signs of kidney failure
Symptoms of early-stage kidney disease may be subtle and hard to identify. They may include:
decreased urine output
swelling in limbs
shortness of breath
Kidney failure urine color
The color of your urine doesn�t tell you much about the state of your kidney function until damage to the kidneys has progressed.
Still, urine color changes may be an early indicator of some issues.
Urine color Indication
clear or pale yellow well-hydrated
dark yellow or amber dehydrated
orange dehydration or bile in the bloodstream
pink or red blood in the urine or having eaten certain foods, like beets
foamy contains a lot of protein; potentially an indicator of kidney disease"
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, causes of kidney failure?","Kidney failure can result from various causes. According to the National Kidney Foundation, the two most common include high blood pressure and diabetes.
People who are most at risk usually have one or more of the following:
Loss of blood flow to the kidneys
A sudden loss of blood flow to your kidneys can prompt kidney failure. Some causes include:
heart attack
heart disease
scarring of the liver or liver failure
dehydration
severe burns
allergic reactions
severe infection, such as sepsis
High blood pressure and anti-inflammatory medications can also limit blood flow.
Urine elimination problems
When your body can�t eliminate urine, toxins build up and overload the kidneys. Some cancers can block the urine passageways, such as:
prostate
colon
cervical
bladder
Other conditions can interfere with urination and possibly lead to kidney failure, including:
kidney stones
enlarged prostate
blood clots within your urinary tract
damage to the nerves that control your bladder
Other causes
Other factors that may lead to kidney failure include:
a blood clot in or around your kidneys
heavy metal poisoning
drugs and alcohol use
vasculitis, an inflammation of the blood vessels
lupus, an autoimmune disease that can cause inflammation of many body organs
glomerulonephritis, an inflammation of the small blood vessels of the kidneys
hemolytic uremic syndrome, which involves the breakdown of red blood cells following a bacterial infection, usually of the intestines
multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cells in your bone marrow
scleroderma, an autoimmune condition that affects your skin
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a disorder that causes blood clots in small vessels
chemotherapy drugs that treat cancer and some autoimmune diseases
dyes used in some imaging tests
certain antibiotics
unmanaged diabetes"
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, who gets kidney failure??","People of all ages develop kidney failure, but the risk increases
with age. According to the CDC, 14%
of U.S. adults have chronic kidney failure.
You may have a higher risk if you have:
diabetes
high blood pressure
heart disease
a family history of kidney failure
The longer you�ve had these conditions, the greater your risk
of chronic kidney failure."
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, diagnostic tests?","Doctors use several tests to diagnose kidney failure. Common tests include:
Urinalysis: A urine sample can show how much protein or sugar is in your urine. A urinary sediment examination looks for red and white blood cells, high levels of bacteria, and high numbers of cellular casts.
Urine volume measurements: Measuring urine output can help diagnose kidney failure. Low output may suggest that kidney disease is due to a urinary blockage.
Blood samples: Blood tests can measure substances filtered by your kidneys, such as blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. A rapid rise in these levels may indicate acute kidney failure.
Imaging: Tests like ultrasounds, MRIs, and CT scans provide images of your kidneys and urinary tract to identify issues.
Kidney tissue sample: Doctors use a kidney biopsy to collect and examine tissue samples."
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, chronic kidney disease stages?","Kidney disease is classified into five stages. These range from very mild (stage 1) to complete kidney failure (stage 5). Symptoms and complications increase as the stages progress.
Stage 1
You may experience no symptoms and have no visible complications. But some kidney damage is present.
Stage 2
Stage 2 kidney disease is still considered mild, but detectable issues like protein in the urine or physical damage to the kidneys may be more obvious.
It�s also a good idea to talk with a doctor about risk factors that could make the disease progress more rapidly, such as:
heart disease
inflammation
blood disorders
Stage 3
At this stage, your kidneys aren�t working as well as they should.
Stage 3 kidney disease is sometimes divided into stages 3a and 3b. A blood test that measures the amount of waste products in your body helps doctors differentiate between the two.
Symptoms may become more apparent. Swelling in hands and feet, back pain, and changes to urination frequency are likely.
A doctor may consider medications to treat underlying conditions that could speed kidney failure.
Stage 4
Stage 4 kidney disease is considered moderate to severe. The kidneys aren�t working well, but you�re not in complete kidney failure yet. Symptoms can include complications like:
anemia
high blood pressure
bone disease
A doctor will likely develop a treatment plan to slow kidney damage.
Stage 5
In stage 5, your kidneys are nearing or in complete failure. Symptoms of the loss of kidney function will be evident, such as vomiting and nausea, trouble breathing, and itchy skin.
You�ll need regular dialysis or a kidney transplant.
The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
estimates that approximately 1 in 500 Americans has stage 5 kidney failure."
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, treatment?","The type of treatment you need depends on the cause and stage of your kidney failure.
Dialysis
Dialysis filters and purifies the blood using a machine to performs the function of the kidneys. Depending on the type of dialysis, you may be connected to a large machine or a portable catheter bag.
Along with dialysis, you may need to follow a low potassium, low salt diet.
Dialysis doesn�t cure kidney failure, but going to regularly scheduled treatments can extend your life.
Kidney transplant
A transplanted kidney can work fully, so you no longer need dialysis.
There�s usually a long wait to receive a donor kidney that�s compatible with your body. If you have a living donor, the process may go more quickly.
Transplant surgery might not be the right treatment option for everyone. It is not always successful.
You must take immunosuppressant drugs after the surgery to prevent your body from rejecting the new kidney. These drugs have their own side effects, some of which can be serious.
You can talk with a doctor about whether you�re a good candidate for a kidney transplant.
Lifestyle modifications
Minimizing your intake of alcohol and making dietary changes may help prevent kidney failure from progressing.
At the early stages and beyond, it�s possible to manage and slow progression with lifestyle factors such as:
Dietary changes
The guidelines for what you eat will often depend on the stage of kidney disease you have and your overall health. Some recommendations might include:
Limiting sodium and potassium: Aim to eat less than 2,000 milligrams per day of both sodium (salt) and potassium.
Limiting phosphorus: Try to stay below 1,000 milligrams
of phosphorus.
Following protein guidelines: In early and moderate kidney disease, you might want to cut back on protein consumption. But you may eat more protein in end-stage kidney failure, depending on your doctor�s recommendations.
Beyond these general guidelines, a doctor may also ask you to avoid certain foods.
Lowering alcohol intake
If you have kidney failure and drink alcohol, your kidneys must work harder than they already do. Alcohol doesn�t metabolize out of your system, so if you have complete kidney failure, you�ll feel its effects until you receive dialysis to filter it from your blood.
Beer, ale, and wine also contain large amounts of phosphorous. Severe heart issues and death are possible if your kidneys cannot filter it out.
If you have kidney failure or late-stage kidney disease, a doctor may recommend you limit alcohol. Eliminating alcohol from your diet, if possible, may be best."
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, diabetes and kidney failure?","Diabetes is the most common cause of kidney failure. About one-third of adults
with diabetes have kidney disease.
Without management, high blood sugar can damage your kidneys. The damage can worsen over time.
Diabetic nephropathy, or kidney damage caused by type 1 or type 2 diabetes, can�t be reversed. Steps to prevent or limit kidney damage can include:
managing your blood sugar
managing blood pressure
taking medications as prescribed
If you have diabetes, a doctor will likely perform regular screenings to monitor for kidney failure. Your risk for diabetic nephropathy increases the longer you live with diabetes."
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, complications?","Kidney failure can lead to various complications. These can include:
anemia
bone weakness, due to an imbalance of phosphorus and calcium
fluid retention (edema)
heart disease
high potassium levels (hyperkalemia)
metabolic acidosis, when the blood becomes too acidic
Many people with kidney failure develop secondary complications. These can include:
depression
liver failure
fluid buildup in the lungs
gout
nerve damage
skin infections"
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, kidney failure outlook?","It�s not possible to know precisely how long a person with kidney failure will live, as it can depend on many factors.
These include:
the underlying cause
how well that underlying cause is managed
any complicating factors, like high blood pressure or diabetes
stage of kidney disease at diagnosis
age
The National Kidney Foundation says that a person on dialysis can expect to live for an average of 5 to 10 years as long as they follow their treatment. Some people live for more than 20 or 30 years.
Once you reach end-stage kidney failure, you will need dialysis or a kidney transplant to live. Missing even one dialysis treatment can decrease your life expectancy.
Proper treatment and healthy lifestyle changes may improve your outlook, such as avoiding certain foods."
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, kidney failure prevention?","You can take steps to lower the risk of kidney failure.
Follow directions when taking over-the-counter medications. Taking doses that are too high, even of common drugs like aspirin, can create high toxin levels quickly. This can overload your kidneys.
Many kidney or urinary tract conditions lead to kidney failure without prompt treatment.
You can help lower your risk of kidney failure by:
eating a balanced diet
maintaining a moderate weight
taking prescribed and over-the-counter medications as directed and not taking more medication than is safe
keeping conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, well managed and following a doctor�s advice"
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, the bottom line?","Kidney failure can develop suddenly or from long-term damage. Possible causes of kidney failure can include diabetes, high blood pressure, and kidney trauma.
Kidney disease is classified into five stages, ranging from mild to complete kidney failure. Symptoms and complications increase as the stages progress.
If you have kidney failure, you can work with a doctor to determine the best treatment options."
dementia,what is dementia? Tell me about dementia? What kind of disease is dementia? Can you elaborate on dementia? What can you tell me about dementia? Could you describe what dementia is? I�d like to know more about dementia. Can you help? What information do you have on dementia? Could you provide information on dementia?,"Dementia is a neurodegenerative disease that has several different forms, symptoms, and causes. There�s currently no cure, but researchers are looking into effective treatments and ways to prevent it.
Dementia is a decline in cognitive function. To be considered dementia, mental impairment must affect at least two brain functions. Dementia may affect:
Dementia may be caused by a variety of illnesses or injuries. Mental impairment may range from mild to severe. It may also cause personality changes.
Some types of dementia are progressive. This means they get worse over time. Some types are treatable or even reversible. Some experts restrict the term �dementia� to irreversible mental deterioration."
dementia,"for dementia, dementia signs and symptoms?","In its early stages, dementia can cause symptoms, such as:
Not coping well with change. Someone may have a hard time accepting changes in schedules or environment.
Subtle changes in short-term memory making. Someone can remember the events of 15 years ago like it was yesterday, but they can�t remember what they had for lunch.
Reaching for the right words. Word recollection or association may be more difficult.
Being repetitive. Someone may ask the same question, complete the same task, or tell the same story multiple times.
Confused sense of direction. Places someone once knew well may now feel foreign. They may also struggle with driving routes they�ve taken for years because it no longer looks familiar.
Struggling to follow storylines. Someone may find following a person�s story or description difficult.
Changes in mood. Depression, frustration, and anger are not uncommon for people with dementia.
Loss of interest. Apathy may occur in people with dementia. This includes losing interest in hobbies or activities that they once enjoyed.
Confusion. People, places, and events may no longer feel familiar. Someone might not remember people who know them.
Difficulty completing everyday tasks. A person in the early stages of dementia may have trouble recalling how to do tasks they�ve done for many years."
dementia,"for dementia, what causes dementia??","Dementia has many causes. In general, it results from the degeneration of neurons (brain cells) or disturbances in other body systems that affect how neurons function.
Several conditions can cause dementia, including diseases of the brain. The most common causes are Alzheimer�s disease and vascular dementia.
Some of the more common causes of dementia include:
Neurodegenerative diseases
�Neurodegenerative� means that neurons gradually stop functioning or function inappropriately and eventually die.
This affects the neuron-to-neuron connections, called synapses, which arehow messages are passed along in your brain. This disconnect can result in a range of dysfunction.
Alzheimer�s disease
Parkinson�s disease with dementia
vascular dementia
chronic alcohol use disorder
Another cause is frontotemporal lobar degeneration. This is a blanket term for a range of conditions that cause damage to the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. They include:
frontotemporal dementia
Pick�s disease
supranuclear palsy
corticobasal degeneration
Other causes of dementia
Dementia has other causes, including:
structural brain disorders, such as normal pressure hydrocephalus and subdural hematoma
metabolic disorders, such as hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 deficiency, and kidney and liver disorders
toxins, such as lead
certain tumors or infections of the brain
medication side effects
Some of these types of dementia may be reversible. These treatable causes of dementia may reverse symptoms if they�re caught early enough. This is one of the many reasons why it�s important to contact your doctor and get a medical workup as soon as symptoms develop."
dementia,"for dementia, types of dementia?","Most cases of dementia are a symptom of a specific disease. Different diseases cause different types of dementia. The most common types of dementia include:
Alzheimer�s disease. The most common type of dementia, Alzheimer�s disease makes up 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases, according to the Alzheimer�s Association.
Vascular dementia. This type of dementia is caused by reduced blood flow in the brain. It may be the result of plaque buildup in arteries that feed blood to the brain or a stroke.
Lewy body dementia. With Lewy body dementia, protein deposits in nerve cells prevent the brain from sending chemical signals. This results in lost messages, delayed reactions, and memory loss.
Parkinson�s disease. Individuals with advanced Parkinson�s disease may develop dementia. Symptoms of this particular type of dementia include problems with reasoning and judgment, as well as increased irritability, paranoia, and depression.
Frontotemporal dementia. Several types of dementia fall into this category. They�re each affected by changes in the front and side parts of the brain. Symptoms include difficulty with language and behavior, as well as loss of inhibitions.
Other types of dementia exist. However, they�re less common. In fact, one type of dementia, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, occurs in only 1 in 1 million people."
dementia,"for dementia, stages of dementia?","In most cases, dementia is progressive, getting worse over time. That said, dementia progresses differently in everyone. However, most people experience symptoms of the following stages of dementia.
Mild cognitive impairment
Older adults may develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI) but may never progress to dementia or any other mental impairment. People with MCI commonly experience forgetfulness, trouble recalling words, and short-term memory problems.
Mild dementia
At this stage, people with mild dementia may be able to function independently. Symptoms include:
short-term memory lapses
personality changes, including anger or depression
misplacing things or forgetfulness
difficulty with complex tasks or problem solving
difficulty expressing emotions or ideas
Moderate dementia
At this stage of dementia, people affected may need assistance from a loved one or care professional. That�s because dementia may now interfere with daily tasks and activities. Symptoms include:
poor judgment
increasing confusion and frustration
memory loss that reaches further into the past
needing help with tasks like dressing and bathing
significant personality changes
Severe dementia
At this late stage of dementia, the mental and physical symptoms of the condition continue to worsen. Symptoms include:
inability to maintain bodily functions, including walking and eventually swallowing and controlling the bladder
inability to communicate
requiring full-time assistance
increased risk of infections
People with dementia will progress through the stages of dementia at different rates."
dementia,"for dementia, dementia testing?","No single test can confirm a dementia diagnosis. Instead, a doctor will use a series of tests and exams. These include:
a thorough medical history
a careful physical exam
laboratory tests, including blood tests
a review of symptoms, including changes in memory, behavior, and brain function
a family history
Doctors can determine if you or a loved one is experiencing symptoms of dementia with a high degree of certainty. However, they may not be able to determine the exact type of dementia. In many cases, symptoms of dementia types overlap. That makes distinguishing between types difficult.
Some doctors will diagnose dementia without specifying the type. In that case, you may wish to visit a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating dementia. These doctors are called neurologists. Some geriatricians also specialize in this type of diagnosis."
dementia,"for dementia, dementia treatment?","Two primary treatments are used to alleviate symptoms of dementia: medications and non-drug therapies. Not all medications are approved for each type of dementia, and no treatment is a cure.
Medications for dementia
Two main types of medication are used to treat symptoms of Alzheimer�s disease and other dementia-causing conditions:
Cholinesterase inhibitors. These drugs increase a chemical called acetylcholine. This chemical may help form memories and improve judgment. It may also delay worsening symptoms of Alzheimer�s disease.
Memantine. This drug is used to delay the onset of cognitive and behavioral symptoms in people with moderate or severe Alzheimer�s disease. Memantine may let people with Alzheimer�s disease maintain their usual mental functions for a longer period of time.
These two drugs may also be prescribed together. Side effects can occur. Other medications may be prescribed to treat related symptoms, such as impaired sleep, mood changes, and more.
Aducanumab (Aduhelm)
Aducanumab is another medication approved to treat Alzheimer�s and may slow the progression of the disease, though research is ongoing. Aducanumab is an anti-amyloid antibody therapy delivered intravenously. It targets a specific protein fragment that can disrupt communication between nerve cells in the brain.
Non-drug therapies
These therapies may help reduce symptoms of dementia and alleviate some of the manageable complications of the condition. Common non-drug treatments for dementia include:
Modifying your environment. Clutter, noise, and overstimulation may reduce focus.
Modifying common tasks. You can work with a therapist or other healthcare professional to break down everyday activities, such as showering or grooming, into manageable tasks.
Occupational therapy. Occupational therapists are specialized healthcare professionals who can help you learn to be safer and more secure with tasks including walking, cooking, and driving."
dementia,"for dementia, dementia prevention?","For decades, doctors and researchers believed dementia could not be prevented or cured. However, new research suggests that may not be the case.
A 2017 review found that more than one-third of dementia cases may be the result of lifestyle factors. Specifically, the researchers identified nine risk factors that may increase a person�s chance of developing dementia. They include:
midlife hypertension
midlife obesity
hearing loss
late-life depression
diabetes
physical inactivity
smoking
social isolation
lower levels of education
The researchers believe that targeting these risk factors with treatment or intervention could delay or possibly prevent some cases of dementia.
A 2019 retrospective study
looked at nearly 200,000 participants of European ancestry. The study suggested that lifestyle factors such as smoking status, physical activity, diet, and alcohol consumption could potentially contribute to the risk of dementia.
These findings suggest that working with your doctor to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle could help prevent or delay the onset of dementia."
dementia,"for dementia, dementia life expectancy?","Individuals living with dementia can and do live for years after their diagnosis. It may seem that dementia is not a fatal disease because of this. However, late-stage dementia is considered terminal.
It�s difficult for doctors to predict life expectancies in people with dementia. Likewise, factors that influence life expectancy may have a different impact on the length of life in each person.
In one 2015 study
, women diagnosed with Alzheimer�s disease lived an average of 5.7 years after diagnosis. Men lived 4.2 years. Life expectancies, the study found, may be shorter for individuals with other types of dementia.
Certain risk factors increase the likelihood of death in people with dementia. These factors include:
increased age
being born male
decreased capabilities and functionality
additional medical conditions, diseases, or diagnoses, such as diabetes or cancer
However, it�s important to remember that dementia doesn�t follow a specific timeline. You or your loved one may progress through the stages of dementia slowly, or the progression may be rapid and unpredictable. This will affect life expectancy."
dementia,"for dementia, dementia vs. alzheimer�s disease?","Dementia and Alzheimer�s disease are not the same. Dementia is an umbrella term used to describe a collection of symptoms related to memory, language, and decision making.
Alzheimer�s disease is the most common type of dementia. It causes difficulty with things like:
short-term memory
depression
disorientation
behavioral changes
Dementia causes symptoms such as:
forgetfulness or memory impairment
loss of sense of direction
confusion
difficulty with personal care
The exact constellation of symptoms will depend on the type of dementia you have.
Alzheimer�s disease can also cause these symptoms, but other symptoms of Alzheimer�s may include depression, impaired judgment, and difficulty speaking.
Likewise, treatments for dementia depend on the type you have. However, Alzheimer�s disease treatments often overlap with other nonpharmacological dementia treatments.
In the case of some types of dementia, treating the underlying cause may be helpful in reducing or stopping the memory and behavior problems. However, that is not the case with Alzheimer�s disease.
Comparing the two may help you tell the difference between symptoms you or a loved one may be experiencing."
dementia,"for dementia, dementia from alcohol?","Alcohol use may be the most preventable risk factor for dementia. A 2018 study
found that the majority of early onset dementia cases were related to alcohol use.
The study found that nearly one-third
of early onset dementia cases were directly linked to alcohol. Plus, 18 percent of people in the study had been diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder.
Alcohol use disorders, the researchers discovered, increase a person�s risk of dementia threefold
.
Not all drinking is dangerous to your memories and mental health. Moderate levels of drinking may even be beneficial to your heart�s health. This includes no more than one glass per day for women and two glasses per day for men."
dementia,"for dementia, isn�t forgetfulness a normal part of aging??","It�s absolutely natural to forget things once in a while. Memory loss by itself does not mean you have dementia. There is a difference between occasional forgetfulness and forgetfulness that is cause for serious concern.
Potential red flags for dementia include:
forgetting who someone is
forgetting how to do common tasks, such as how to use the telephone or find your way home
inability to comprehend or retain information that has been clearly provided
Get medical attention if you experience any of the above.
Getting lost in familiar settings is often one of the first signs of dementia. For example, you might have trouble driving to the supermarket."
dementia,"for dementia, how common is dementia??","According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 55 million people
have dementia worldwide, with around 10 million new cases reported each year.
The number of people receiving dementia diagnoses or living with dementia is increasing. This increase is due partly to increasing life expectancy.
By 2030, the size of the population 65 years of age and older in the United States is expected to almost double from 37 million people in 2006 to an estimated 74 million by 2030, according to the Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics.
The rates of dementia will likely increase with this larger population of people older than 65."
dementia,"for dementia, what research is being done??","Scientists all over the world are working to gain a better understanding of the many different aspects of dementia. This might help to develop preventive measures, improved early detection diagnostic tools, better and longer-lasting treatments, and even cures.
For example, 2018 research on mice suggests a common asthma drug called zileuton might slow, stop, and potentially reverse the development of proteins in the brain. These proteins are common in people with Alzheimer�s disease.
Another 2021 review suggests deep brain stimulation could be an effective way to limit symptoms of Alzheimer�s in older adults. This method has been used to treat symptoms of Parkinson�s disease, such as tremors, for decades.
Even simple blood tests have now been developed that can detect Alzheimer�s, according to a 2021 study
. As well, researchers are looking at the possibility of slowing the progression of Alzheimer�s.
Scientists are investigating a variety of factors they think might influence the development of dementia, including:
genetic factors
various neurotransmitters
inflammation
factors that influence programmed cell death in the brain
tau, a protein found in neurons of the central nervous system
oxidative stress, or chemical reactions that can damage proteins, DNA, and lipids inside cells
This research can help doctors and scientists better understand what causes dementia, and then discover how best to treat and possibly prevent the disorder.
According to a 2019 study

Could you describe what osteoarthritis is? I�d like to know more about osteoarthritis. Can you help? What information do you have on osteoarthritis? Could you provide information on osteoarthritis?,"Arthritis is an inflammation of the joints that may affect one joint or multiple joints. The symptoms of arthritis usually develop over time, but they may also appear suddenly.
There are more than
100 different types of arthritis, with different causes and treatment methods.
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis
in the United States. Other common types
include:
The typical age for developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is between ages 30 and 50. It can, however, affect children, teens, and younger adults.
Osteoarthritis (OA) commonly develops after the age 50 or 60 years, but there are studies that reveal radiographic evidence of OA occurring in women in their 40s. It also tends to be more prevalent in individuals who are overweight.

osteoarthritis,"for osteoarthritis, what are the symptoms of arthritis??","Joint pain, stiffness, and swelling are the most common symptoms
of arthritis. Your symptoms may also feel worse in the morning when you get out of bed or upon standing up after you�ve been resting.
Other symptoms of osteoarthritis include:
limited range of motion that sometimes goes away after movement
clicking or popping with bending
muscle weakness around the joint
instability or buckling of the joint
bony growths in the fingers
grating or scraping feeling in the knees
Other symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis include:
morning stiffness that can last 30 minutes or more
more than one affected joint
onset in smaller joints like feet and hands
same joints on both sides of the body are affected
fatigue
low-grade fever
inflammation of the eyes and mouth
inflammation of the heart muscle and blood vessels
low red blood cell count"
osteoarthritis,"for osteoarthritis, what causes arthritis??","Arthritis may be caused by
:
wear and tear of a joint from overuse
age (OA is most common in adults over age 50)
injuries
obesity
autoimmune disorders
genes or family history
muscle weakness
Osteoarthritis
Normal wear and tear causes OA, one of the most common forms of arthritis. An infection or injury to the joints can exacerbate this natural breakdown of cartilage tissue.
Cartilage is a firm but flexible connective tissue in your joints. It protects the joints by absorbing the pressure and shock created when you move and put stress on them. A reduction in the normal amount of this cartilage tissue causes some forms of arthritis.
Your risk of developing OA may
also be higher if you have a family history of the disease.
Rheumatoid arthritis
Another common form of arthritis, RA, is an autoimmune disorder. It occurs when your body�s immune system attacks the tissues of the body, resulting in inflammation to joints as well as other body organs.
In the joints, this inflammatory response affects the synovium, a soft tissue in your joints that produces a fluid that nourishes the cartilage and lubricates the joints, eventually destroying both bone and cartilage inside the joint.
The exact cause of the immune system�s attacks is unknown. But scientists have discovered genetic markers that increase your risk of developing RA fivefold."
osteoarthritis,"for osteoarthritis, how is arthritis diagnosed??","Seeing your primary care physician is a good first step if you�re unsure who to see for an arthritis diagnosis. They will perform a physical exam to check for fluid around the joints, warm or red joints, and document the range of motion in the joints. Your doctor can refer you to a specialist if needed.
If you�re experiencing severe symptoms, you may choose to schedule an appointment with a rheumatologist first. This may lead to a faster diagnosis and treatment.
Documenting inflammation levels in your blood and aspirating and analyzing joint fluids, if present, can help your doctor determine what kind of arthritis you have.
Blood tests that check for specific types of antibodies like anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), rheumatoid factor (RF) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) are also common diagnostic tests.
Doctors commonly use imaging scans such as X-ray, MRI, and CT scans to produce an image of your bones and cartilage. This helps them rule out other causes of your symptoms, such as bone spurs.

osteoarthritis,"for osteoarthritis, how is arthritis treated??","The main goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of pain you�re experiencing and prevent additional damage to the joints. You�ll learn what works best for you in terms of managing pain.
In general, treatment for arthritis involves
a combination of:
medications and supplements
physical therapy
occupational therapy
nutrient-rich diet
regular exercise
weight loss, if needed
heat and cold compresses
mobility assistance devices, such as canes or walkers
Improving your joint function is also important. Your doctor may prescribe a combination of treatment methods to achieve the best results.
Medications
A number of different types of medication treat arthritis:
Analgesics, such as hydrocodone (Vicodin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol), are effective for pain management, but do not help decrease inflammation.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil) and salicylates, help manage pain and inflammation. Salicylates can thin the blood, so they should not be used with additional blood thinning medications.
Menthol or capsaicin creams. These creams block the transmission of pain signals from your joints.
Steroids, like prednisone, help reduce inflammation but should be used cautiously and for brief periods of time.
Immunosuppressants and biologics. Immunosuppressants and biologics are prescribed for moderate to severe inflammatory arthritis like RA.
If you have RA, your doctor may recommend corticosteroids or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), which suppress your immune system.
DMARDs and biologics are being prescribed earlier in the course of RA. Methotrexate is now a first-line drug for treatment.
There are also many medications to treat OA available over the counter or by prescription.
Supplements
While clinical evidence and safety data
are lacking for many herbs and supplements marketed for arthritis, there are a few supplements that may be beneficial. For example, avocado and soybean unsaponifiables (ASU) may help OA symptoms. Fish oil and turmeric supplements may help reduce inflammation in RA.
However, you should talk with your doctor before taking any supplements for arthritis to make sure they are safe for you and will not interact with any medications you�re currently taking.
Surgery
Surgery to replace your joint with an artificial one may be an option. This form of surgery is most commonly performed to replace hips and knees.
If your arthritis is most severe in your fingers or wrists, your doctor may perform joint fusion. In this procedure, the ends of your bones are fused, eliminating the joint and therefore eliminating the site of inflammation.
Physical therapy
Physical therapy involving exercises that help strengthen the muscles around the affected joint is a core component of arthritis treatment.
Outside of your appointments, your physical therapist will likely recommend a plan of care that includes daily movement along with exercises you can complete on your own at home. Collectively, these can help build strength, flexibility, and balance to improve mobility while also preventing falls."
osteoarthritis,"for osteoarthritis, what lifestyle changes can help people with arthritis??","Losing any excess weight and maintaining a moderate weight reduces the risk
of developing OA and can reduce symptoms if you already have the condition.
Eating a nutrient-dense diet is important for weight loss. Choosing a diet with lots of antioxidants, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs, can help reduce inflammation. Other inflammation-reducing foods include fish and nuts.
Foods that should be limited or avoided if you have arthritis include:
fried foods
processed foods
dairy products
a high intake of meat
Some research
also suggests that gluten antibodies may be present in people with RA. A gluten-free diet may improve symptoms and disease progression. A 2015 study
also recommends a gluten-free diet for all people who receive a diagnosis of undifferentiated connective tissue disease.
Regular exercise can keep your joints flexible. Swimming is often a good form of exercise for people with arthritis because it does not put pressure on your joints the way running and walking do. Staying active is important, but listening to your body when it�s signally resting and avoiding overexerting yourself are just as essential.
At-home exercises you can try include:
the head tilt, neck rotation, and other exercises to relieve pain in your neck
finger bends and thumb bends to ease pain in your hands
leg raises, hamstring stretches, and other easy exercises for knee arthritis"
osteoarthritis,"for osteoarthritis, complications?","When left untreated, symptoms of arthritis may worsen and affect your day-to-day life. Below are some of the possible complications associated with this condition:
Reduced mobility. As arthritis progresses, you may experience less comfortable movement. This can interfere with your daily routine and may keep you from your favorite activities as well as socializing.
Possible weight gain. This is attributed to decreased movements, as well as discomfort that keeps you from exercising.
Increased risk of metabolic disorders. Being overweight with an inflammatory condition like arthritis may increase your chances of developing type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and heart disease.
Inflammation in other areas of your body. If your arthritis is attributed to an autoimmune disease like with RA, the inflammation can spread and affect your skin, eyes, blood vessels, and lungs.
Risk of falls. According to the Arthritis Foundation, people with OA are more likely to experience falls and possible fractures. This is primarily caused by related muscle weakness, but dizziness from pain medications can also lead to falls.
Decreased ability to work. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that about 60 percent
of people with arthritis are working age. Arthritis may affect your ability to move around in the workplace or even get from your mode of transportation to your job site.
Effects on mental health. Arthritis may increase the risk of anxiety and depression due to ongoing pain, inflammation, and social isolation.

osteoarthritis,"for osteoarthritis, risk factors?","The overall risk factors for arthritis
include:
Obesity. Particularly associated with OA, being overweight puts added stress on weight-bearing joints in the body, such as your knees and hips. Losing excess weight can help reduce your risk of developing arthritis, and it may also help if you already have the condition.
Age and gender. The risk of developing arthritis increases with age. Also, women are more likely
than men to develop most forms of arthritis. The exception is gout, which is more prominent in men.
Overuse injuries. Repetitive stress injuries incurred during exercise, your job, or other activities may increase your risk of developing OA in the affected joint(s) later in life.
Your genes. A family history of autoimmune diseases as well as certain inherited genes may increase your risk of RA and other related types of arthritis.
Smoking. Your risk of developing RA may increase if you smoke
, and smoking can in turn make this autoimmune disease worse."

I�d like to know more about sepsis. Can you help? What information do you have on sepsis? Could you provide information on sepsis?,"Sepsis is a life threatening illness caused by your body�s response to an infection. Your immune system protects you from many illnesses and infections, but it�s also possible for it to go into overdrive in response to an infection.
There are approximately 1.7 million cases of sepsis each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
. In addition, this type of infection kills nearly 270,000 people in the United States every year.
Keep reading to learn more about sepsis symptoms, treatment, and complications."
sepsis,"for sepsis, what is sepsis??","Sepsis develops when an existing infection triggers an extreme immune system response in your body.
When you experience an infection, your immune system responds by releasing proteins and other chemicals to fight it. Sepsis occurs when this response gets out of control, triggering extensive inflammation.
Most infections that cause sepsis are bacterial. But other infections � including COVID-19, influenza, and fungal infections � can also lead to sepsis.
Sepsis causes fever, a rapid heart rate, and difficulty breathing, among other symptoms. It�s a serious condition that requires swift medical treatment.
Severe sepsis can lead to septic shock, a medical emergency. Septic shock is associated with a significant drop in blood pressure, organ failure, and widespread tissue damage. If left untreated, it can be fatal.
Stages of sepsis
There are three stages of sepsis:
Sepsis. An infection gets into your bloodstream and causes inflammation in your body.
Severe sepsis. The infection and inflammation is severe enough to start affecting organ function.
Septic shock. Septic shock is a severe complication of sepsis that causes a significant drop in blood pressure. This can lead to many serious complications including:
organ dysfunction
respiratory or heart failure
stroke
possible death
While sepsis often occurs in hospital settings, it can also happen in other locations. In some cases, you might not even know you have an infection that could potentially lead to sepsis."
sepsis,"for sepsis, what are the symptoms of sepsis??","It�s important to seek immediate medical attention if you have any symptoms of sepsis. The earlier you seek treatment, the greater chance you have of recovering.
Signs and symptoms of sepsis
Symptoms of sepsis can include:
fever and/or chills
confusion or disorientation
difficulty breathing
fast heart rate or low blood pressure (hypotension)
extreme pain
sweaty skin
It�s possible to mistake the symptoms above for those of another condition, like pneumonia, COVID-19, or cancer.
In addition, sepsis symptoms can be particularly hard to identify in infants, children, and people with:
communication challenges
learning disabilities
dementia
It�s best to seek medical assistance right away if you suspect sepsis. A health professional can examine you or the person you care for to make a diagnosis.
Signs and symptoms of severe sepsis
Severe sepsis is characterized by organ failure. You must have one or more of the following signs to be diagnosed with severe sepsis:
difficulty breathing
bluish discoloration of the skin, especially lips, fingers, toes
chills due to a drop in body temperature
decreased urination
dizziness
changes in mental ability
extreme weakness (asthenia)
low platelet count (thrombocytopenia)
abnormal heart functions
unconsciousness
Signs and symptoms of septic shock (septicemia)
Sepsis can advance very quickly to severe sepsis and septic shock. As it transitions, it becomes more life threatening.
Some severe sepsis and septic shock symptoms can overlap, like severe difficulty breathing, acute confusion, and bluish skin. Another key symptom of septic shock is very low blood pressure.

sepsis,"for sepsis, what causes sepsis??","Any infection can trigger sepsis, but the following types of infections have a higher risk of causing sepsis:
pneumonia
abdominal infections
kidney infections
blood poisoning
According to the National Institute of General Medical Sciences
, the number of sepsis cases in the United States increases every year. Possible reasons for the increase include:
an aging population, due to the fact that sepsis is more common in seniors
an increase in antibiotic resistance, which happens when an antibiotic medication loses its ability to resist or kill bacteria
an increase in the number of people with illnesses that weaken their immune systems"
sepsis,"for sepsis, who is at risk for sepsis??","Although some people have a higher risk of infection, anyone can get sepsis. People who are at the highest risk include:
young children and seniors
people with weaker immune systems, including people with HIV or those undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer
people in intensive care units (ICUs)
people exposed to invasive devices, like intravenous catheters or breathing tubes"
sepsis,"for sepsis, newborns and sepsis?","Neonatal sepsis occurs when a baby gets a blood infection within the first month of life.
Neonatal sepsis is classified based on the timing of the infection, according to whether the infection was contracted during birth (early-onset) or after birth (late-onset). This helps the doctor decide what kind of treatment to administer.
Low birth weight and premature babies are more susceptible to late-onset sepsis because their immune systems are immature. While symptoms can be subtle and nonspecific, some signs include:
listlessness
not breastfeeding/feeding well
low body temperature
apnea (gaps in breathing)
fever
pale color
poor skin circulation with cool extremities
abdominal swelling
vomiting
diarrhea
seizures
jitteriness
yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)
Neonatal sepsis is still a leading cause of infant death. With early diagnosis and treatment, most babies can recover completely and have no other problems.
In addition, universal maternal screening and proper neonatal testing have significantly reduced the risk of neonatal sepsis."
sepsis,"for sepsis, seniors and sepsis?","The immune system tends to weaken with age. According to a 2017 review, around 40 to 50 percent of all bacteremia cases occur in older adults, which can lead to sepsis.
But age isn�t the only factor that puts seniors at an increased risk. Older adults are also more likely to have existing chronic illnesses, like diabetes, kidney disease, cancer, or high blood pressure.
Other risk factors pertinent to seniors include increased use of medication, malnutrition, and imbalances in intestinal microbiota.
Older adults can contract sepsis from common infections, like pneumonia or urinary tract infections (UTIs). Infections from pressure sores can also lead to sepsis.
Finally, sepsis symptoms like confusion and disorientation may be particularly difficult to identify in older adults with dementia."
sepsis,"for sepsis, how is sepsis diagnosed??","If you have sepsis symptoms, your doctor will order tests to diagnose and determine the severity of your infection. One of the first tests is a blood test. Your blood is checked for complications like:
infection
clotting problems
abnormal liver or kidney function
decreased amount of oxygen
an electrolyte imbalance, which affects the amount of water in your body and the acidity of your blood
Depending on your symptoms and the results of your blood test, your doctor may order other tests, including:
a urine test (to check for bacteria in your urine)
a wound secretion test (to check an open wound for an infection)
a mucus secretion test (to identify germs responsible for an infection)
If your doctor can�t determine the source of an infection using the above tests, they may order an internal view of your body using one of the following:
chest x-rays to view the lungs
CT scans to view possible infections in the appendix, pancreas, or bowel area
ultrasounds to view infections in the gallbladder or ovaries
MRI scans, which can identify soft tissue infections"
sepsis,"for sepsis, sepsis criteria?","There are two sets of criteria doctors use to determine the severity of sepsis. One set of criteria is for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).
SIRS is defined when you meet two or more of the following criteria:
a fever of more than 100.4�F (38�C) or less than 96.8�F (36�C)
a heart rate of more than 90 beats per minute
a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) of less than 32 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg)
an abnormal white blood cell count
Another tool is the quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA). It uses the results of three criteria:
low blood pressure reading (systolic blood pressure of less than 100 mm Hg)
high respiratory rate (greater than 22 breaths per minute)
Glasgow coma scale score of 14 or less to determine your level of consciousness
A positive qSOFA occurs when two or more of the above measurements are abnormal. Some physicians prefer using qSOFA because, unlike the SIRS criteria, qSOFA doesn�t require laboratory tests.
The results of either of these assessments will help your doctor determine the best course of treatment."
sepsis,"for sepsis, how is sepsis treated??","Sepsis can quickly progress to septic shock and death if it�s left untreated. Doctors use a number of medications to treat sepsis, including:
intravenous (IV) antibiotics to fight the infection
medications to increase blood pressure
insulin to stabilize blood sugar
corticosteroids to reduce inflammation
pain relievers to help with discomfort
Severe sepsis may also require large amounts of IV fluids and a respirator for breathing.
Dialysis might be necessary if the kidneys are affected. Your kidneys help filter harmful wastes, salt, and excess water from your blood. With dialysis, a machine performs these functions.
In some cases, surgery may be needed to remove the source of an infection. This may include draining a pus-filled abscess or removing infected tissue.
Treatment options may vary slightly for older adults, depending on their risk factors. According to a 2016 review
, older adults may be more sensitive to medications that increase blood pressure and antibiotics.
Additionally, seniors are more likely to develop delirium in the ICU and should be regularly screened for sepsis symptoms."
sepsis,"for sepsis, is sepsis contagious??","Sepsis isn�t contagious. But the pathogens responsible for the original infection, like viral pneumonia or COVID-19, can be contagious.
Sepsis spreads within a person�s body from the original source of infection to other organs through the bloodstream."
sepsis,"for sepsis, recovery from sepsis?","Recovering from sepsis depends on the severity of your condition and any pre-existing health issues you might have. While many people make a full recovery, others report lasting effects.
The UK Sepsis Trust reports that it can take up to 18 months before people who�ve had sepsis start feeling like their usual selves again.
According to the Sepsis Alliance, around 50 percent of sepsis survivors deal with a condition called post-sepsis syndrome (PSS). This condition includes long-term effects like:
damaged organs
insomnia
nightmares
disabling muscle and joint pains
fatigue
poor concentration
lowered cognitive functioning
lowered self-esteem"
sepsis,"for sepsis, sepsis prevention?","You can reduce your risk of sepsis by preventing the spread of infection. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, this is more important than ever.
Severe COVID-19 infections cause symptoms similar to sepsis. In addition, contracting COVID-19 puts you at an increased risk of developing another infection. A 2021 review
reported that up to 17 percent of people admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 had additional infections.
You can help prevent both COVID-19 and other infections by taking the following precautions:
Stay up to date on your vaccinations. Get vaccinated for COVID-19, the flu, pneumonia, and other common infections.
Keep your distance from people outside your household. Avoid non-essential travel and activities, and stay 6 feet away from people you don�t know.
Wear a mask. Masks help protect you and others from respiratory infections. Wear a mask in indoor public spaces, like grocery stores and movie theaters.
Practice good hygiene. This means practicing proper wound care, hand-washing, and bathing regularly.
Get immediate care if you develop signs of infection. Every minute counts when it comes to sepsis treatment. The sooner you get treatment, the better the outcome."
sepsis,"for sepsis, sepsis complications?","Sepsis symptoms can range from mild to severe. Complications are more likely in severe cases. These complications can include:
blood clots
an increased risk of infection
tissue death (gangrene)
organ damage
organ failure, particularly the kidneys, heart, and lungs
Severe cases of sepsis can be fatal. A 2020 review
found that the mortality rate for sepsis after 90 days was 32.2 percent. The mortality rate for septic shock after 90 days was 38.5 percent."
sepsis,"for sepsis, the bottom line?","Sepsis is a life threatening illness caused by your body�s response to an infection. Sepsis occurs when your body�s immune system response gets out of control, triggering extensive inflammation.
Sepsis isn�t contagious. But bacterial, viral, and fungal infections that can trigger sepsis can be spread from person to person. COVID-19 is an example of one such infection that can lead to sepsis. Those at the highest risk of sepsis include newborns, seniors, and people with pre-existing health conditions.
Among other symptoms, sepsis causes fever or chills, a rapid heart rate, confusion, and difficulty breathing. Sepsis is a medical emergency.
Seek immediate medical attention if you suspect that you have sepsis, especially if you have a known infection.

rash,"for rash, what is a viral rash??","Viral infections are illnesses caused by a virus rather than bacteria or fungi. Many viral infections, especially those that tend to affect toddlers and children, can cause skin rashes.
While they can look alarming, these rashes usually aren�t a cause for concern, and they disappear once the infection clears up. Viral rashes are caused by either an immune response to the virus or damage to skin cells from the virus.
Read on to learn more about the symptoms of viral rashes, including when you should reach out to a healthcare professional."
rash,"for rash, types of viral rashes?","The characteristics of viral rashes can vary greatly. However, most look like splotchy red spots on lighter skin or purplish spots on darker skin.
These spots might come on suddenly or appear gradually over several days. They can also appear in a small section or cover multiple areas. For example, a measles-related rash starts on your cheeks before eventually spreading to your torso and limbs.
Viral rashes might also feel itchy or painful to the touch. The best way to identify a viral rash is to check for any symptoms of a viral infection, such as:
fever
chills
body aches
fatigue
Measles
Measles is a highly contagious viral infection. It can cause many symptoms, including a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the body. phichet chaiyabin/Shutterstock
Measles is a highly contagious disease among people who are not protected by a vaccine. It can be dangerous in young children and infants.
The measles rash generally starts off as a red, blotchy rash on the face. Over the course of a few days, it can spread to the torso and then the rest of the body.
The rash typically consists of flat pink or red spots that appear 3 to 5 days
after infection. On darker skin, it can be flesh-colored to slightly purplish-gray, with flat to slightly raised bumps.
The rash occurs because your immune system detects the virus as it travels through your bloodstream. Immune cells then release chemicals to destroy the virus. However, these chemicals also cause skin inflammation, resulting in a rash.
Symptoms of measles infection may include:
high fever with spikes of more than 104� F (40� C)
cough
runny nose
conjunctivitis, a condition where the eyes become red and watery
blotchy rash that spreads from the face to the body
German measles (rubella)
Rubella is a viral illness that causes a rash on the face that spreads to the rest of the body. Akkalak Aiempradit/Shutterstock
The rubella virus, also known as German measles, typically causes mild illness in both children and adults. However, this can cause stillbirth or miscarriage and severe birth defects in developing babies.
People with rubella can pass the virus to others by sneezing and coughing as well as through their saliva. They may be contagious for a full week before they develop a rash. They�ll usually continue to be contagious for another week after the rash appears.
The rash caused by German measles typically starts on the face, and within 3 days, it spreads to the rest of the body. The rash can appear red on light skin. It may be hard to see on darker skin but feel rough or bumpy to the touch.
Symptoms of German measles can include:
low-grade fever
headache
swollen lymph nodes
cough or runny nose
Mononucleosis (mono)
VIEW GALLERY
2
Infectious mononucleosis is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This virus is common in teenagers and young adults but can occur at any age. A rash may occur with infection, though it is not the primary symptom.
Like its nickname � the kissing disease � suggests, mono is passed through bodily fluids like saliva.
Mono can have three different types of rashes. Mono rashes can appear as:
A generalized rash. This looks like generalized red spots on lighter skin to pinkish-purple on darker skin, and it can be either flat or small bumps.
A drug rash. Mono is caused by a virus and isn�t treated with an antibiotic. Someone may be mistakenly diagnosed with strep throat and treated with an antibiotic, which may result in a drug rash. The rash is usually temporary, and it will likely be itchy, raised, and splotchy.
Petechiae. These can look like small reddish-purple dots on the skin or inside the mouth. They happen from broken capillaries. When you apply pressure, petechiae stay the same color.
Symptoms of mononucleosis may include:
fatigue
fever of 101�F (38.3�C) to 104�F (40�C)
sore throat
swollen lymph nodes
rash
Chickenpox
VIEW GALLERY
2
Chickenpox, caused by the varicella-zoster virus, causes a rash with fluid-filled pustules. This virus is highly contagious to those who have not been vaccinated.
You can catch chickenpox by coming into contact with the saliva of a person who has the virus, such as when they sneeze or cough. You can also get the disease by touching the blisters or the liquid inside the blisters. Pregnant people can also pass chickenpox to their babies before birth.
For those who have received one or two doses of the chickenpox vaccine, milder breakthrough cases can occur, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
.
The chickenpox rash typically has three phases:
Raised bumps appear on the skin. Depending on the color of your skin, they may appear pink, red, brown, or purplish.
These bumps then become fluid-filled blisters.
The blisters eventually burst and scab over.
Symptoms of chickenpox may include:
itchy rash
fever
tiredness and feeling unwell
headache
loss of appetite
Shingles
VIEW GALLERY

Shingles infection is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox. If you have had chickenpox, you are at risk of developing shingles.
The risk of reactivating the virus increases with age, and 1 out of every 2 people in the United States will develop shingles in their lifetime, according to the CDC
.
You can get shingles from direct contact with blisters or the fluid inside them.
Shingles involves a reactivation of the chickenpox virus that�s lying dormant in your nerves. When the virus reactivates, it travels down your nerves to your skin. As the virus spreads there, the shingles rash begins to form.
Though similar to chickenpox spots in children, the shingles rash and illness are often more severe in adults. Older adults may also be at risk for complications such as nerve pain, blindness, and neurological conditions.
People who develop shingles often note that pain occurred at the site where the rash develops. Unlike the rash caused by a chickenpox infection, a shingles rash typically occurs on one side of the body, often in a single area or stripe.
Symptoms of a shingles infection may include:
rash that can occur in a single area of the skin
fever
headache
fatigue
chills
photosensitivity (sensitivity to light)
upset stomach
Hand, foot, and mouth disease
Hand, foot, and mouth disease is a common infectious disease that�s caused by the coxsackievirus. adriaticfoto/Shutterstock
Hand, foot, and mouth disease is caused by viruses in the enterovirus family. It commonly affects children under age 5, but it can affect people of any age.
It can be very contagious but does not typically cause serious illness. You can get hand, foot, and mouth disease by coming into contact with the bodily fluids of a person who has the virus. This includes:
saliva
mucus
feces
the fluid inside of their blisters
Like its name suggests, the rash associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease often occurs on those parts of the body.
People with the virus can develop painful sores on the back of the mouth and a rash on their skin. This rash can look like flat, red to purple spots or liquid-filled blisters.
While it often appears on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet, it can show up on other parts of the body as well. Per the CDC
, this might include the:
knees
elbows
buttocks
genital area
Symptoms of hand, foot, and mouth disease can include:
fever
flu-like symptoms
rash
mouth sores
sore throat
headache
reduced appetite
malaise or generally not feeling well
Fifth disease
Fifth disease is a viral illness caused by parvovirus, which can cause a �slapped cheek� rash. Kardelen Yang?n via Wikipedia
Fifth disease is a viral illness that can cause a red rash on the cheeks or limbs. It is also known as slapped cheek disease.
In children, fifth disease can be mild, but it may be more severe for:
adults
people who are pregnant
people with weakened immune systems
This virus spreads through bodily fluids, such as the respiratory particles in saliva and mucus, when a person with the virus coughs or sneezes. It can also be passed during pregnancy to an unborn child and by blood.
The rash caused by fifth disease more commonly appears in children, per the CDC
. It may be itchy or go through periods of itchiness. Some people may develop a second rash on another part of the body a few days later.
Symptoms of fifth disease can include:
fever
rash
runny nose
headache
joint pain and swelling
Roseola
Roseola is a common viral illness in small children. It causes a rash that usually occurs after a fever. phadungsak sawasdee/Shutterstock
Roseola, also known as sixth disease, is a contagious illness that typically affects children 6 months to 2 years old. The virus enters the body through the nose and mouth from the respiratory droplets of a person with the virus.
Children with roseola often experience a rash after symptoms of high fever and mild respiratory illness.
The rash caused by roseola tends to first appear on the trunk of the body before spreading to the arms and legs.
The spots can appear pink or slightly darker tones, depending on the color of the child�s skin. When touched, the spots may become lighter in color, a sign that the small capillaries are dilated. On darker skin, this may be harder to see.
The rash often appears as the fever decreases.
Symptoms of roseola include:
respiratory symptoms
sudden high fever
fever that continues for 3 to 4 days
swelling of the eyelids
irritability
rash
West Nile virus
West Nile virus can cause a rash that may resemble rashes from other viral illnesses. Sejvar JJ. (2014). Clinical manifestations and outcomes of West Nile virus infection. https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/6/2/606
The West Nile virus is caused by the bite of an infected mosquito. It can affect people of all ages.
Many people who have this virus don�t develop any symptoms of the disease. But 1 in 5 people
may develop a fever that occurs with other symptoms, including a rash.
The West Nile virus can cause a maculopapular rash, with both flat discolored spots and raised bumps. It tends to appear on the trunk and limbs 5 days
after other symptoms, such as fever and fatigue, begin.
Symptoms of the West Nile virus include:
fever
fatigue
headache
body aches
joint pain
vomiting
diarrhea
rash
Some people with the West Nile virus develop a serious and sometimes fatal illness that affects the central nervous system. Severe symptoms may include:
high fever
disorientation
stiff neck
coma
tremors
paralysis
Zika virus
Zika virus is a recently discovered viral illness that can cause rash. Koenig KL, et al. (2016). Identify-isolate-inform: A tool for initial detection and management of zika virus patients in the emergency department. https://escholarship.org/uc/item/72w2v02d
The Zika virus is mostly spread by Aedes mosquitos that have the virus. A person who contracts the virus while pregnant can also pass the virus to their child, which may cause birth defects.
The Zika virus rash often appears as red spots and blotches that start on the face. It then spreads to the torso and limbs, including the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.
According to a 2020 study, itchiness also tends to occur with an infection.
Symptoms of Zika infection may include:
rash
itchiness
joint pain
headache
fever
muscle weakness
conjunctivitis (pink eye)
Dengue fever

Dengue fever is a disease transmitted by an infected mosquito. It can cause either mild or severe illness.
Rash may occur in two phases of the disease. It can first appear as facial flushing that feels warm to the touch. A second rash can also occur 3 days to 1 week
following the fever.
This rash has flat pinkish or red spots that can merge together. There may be circular areas where the skin is clear and central pinpoint spots that bleed, often called white islands in a sea of red.
Symptoms of dengue fever can include:
fever
rash
nausea and vomiting
pain behind the eyes
muscle, joint, or bone pain
Warning signs of severe dengue usually begin 24 to 48 hours
after the fever has gone down and can include:
pain in the abdomen
bleeding from the nose or gums
blood in vomit, which can appear like coffee grounds
blood in stool, which may appear like red blood or black stool"
rash,"for rash, treatment options?","Viral infections often have to run their course. Unlike bacterial infections, they don�t respond to antibiotics, so treatment usually focuses on relieving symptoms.
You can try to speed up the healing process by drinking lots of fluids and allowing your body plenty of rest.
If you have a fever or body aches, you can take medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil). Parents should not give aspirin to children under age 3 without consulting a doctor.
If you have an itchy viral rash, you can try applying a cool compress or calamine lotion to the affected area. Try to avoid scratching it if you can.
For some viral infections, such as shingles, your doctor might prescribe an antiviral medication."
rash,"for rash, when to contact a doctor?","While it�s always a good idea to talk with a doctor when you notice a new rash, you should definitely make an appointment if you have a rash that:
lasts longer than a week, especially if it doesn�t seem to be improving
starts to blister
spreads rapidly or is all over your body
shows signs of redness, swelling, and oozing
is painful"
rash,"for rash, takeaway?","Many viral infections can cause a skin rash. Most viral infections clear up on their own, but some may require antiviral medication. Contact your doctor if the rash doesn�t seem to be getting any better after a week.
You should also reach out to a healthcare professional if you have a rash and live in or have recently visited a tropical or subtropical climate. Viruses spread by insects tend to be more common in these areas and may require antiviral medication."

What can you tell me about acute kidney injury? Could you describe what acute kidney injury is? I�d like to know more about acute kidney injury. Can you help? What information do you have on acute kidney injury? Could you provide information on acute kidney injury?,"What is acute kidney failure?
Acute kidney failure happens when your kidneys suddenly lose the ability to eliminate excess salts, fluids, and waste materials from the blood. This elimination is the core of your kidneys� main function. Body fluids can rise to dangerous levels when kidneys lose their filtering ability. The condition will also cause electrolytes and waste material to accumulate in your body, which can also be life-threatening.
Acute kidney failure is also called acute kidney injury or acute renal failure. It�s common in people who are already in the hospital. It may develop rapidly over a few hours. It can also develop over a few days to weeks. People who are critically ill and need intensive care have the highest risk of developing acute kidney failure.
Acute kidney failure can be life-threatening and requires intensive treatment. However, it may be reversible. If you�re in good health otherwise, recovery is possible."
acute kidney injury,"for acute kidney injury, what are the causes of acute kidney failure??","Acute kidney failure can occur for many reasons. Among the most common reasons are:
acute tubular necrosis (ATN)
severe or sudden dehydration
toxic kidney injury from poisons or certain medications
autoimmune kidney diseases, such as acute nephritic syndrome and interstitial nephritis
urinary tract obstruction
Reduced blood flow can damage your kidneys. The following conditions can lead to decreased blood flow to your kidneys:
low blood pressure
burns
dehydration
hemorrhage
injury
septic shock
serious illness
surgery
Certain disorders can cause clotting within your kidney�s blood vessels, and this can lead to acute kidney failure. These conditions include:
hemolytic uremic syndrome
idiopathic thrombocytopenic thrombotic purpura (ITTP)
malignant hypertension
transfusion reaction
scleroderma
Some infections, such as septicemia and acute pyelonephritis, can directly injure your kidneys.
Pregnancy can also cause complications that harm the kidneys, including placenta previa and placenta abruption."
acute kidney injury,"for acute kidney injury, what are the risk factors for acute kidney failure??","The chances of acquiring acute kidney failure are greater if you�re an older person or if you have any of the following long-term health problems:
kidney disease
liver disease
diabetes, especially if it�s not well controlled
high blood pressure
heart failure
morbid obesity
If you�re ill or being treated in a hospital�s intensive care unit, you�re at an extremely high risk for acute kidney failure. Being the recipient of heart surgery, abdominal surgery, or a bone marrow transplant can also increase your risk."
acute kidney injury,"for acute kidney injury, what are the symptoms of acute kidney failure??","The symptoms of acute kidney failure include:
bloody stools
breath odor
slow, sluggish movements
generalized swelling or fluid retention
fatigue
pain between ribs and hips
hand tremor
bruising easily
changes in mental status or mood, especially in older adults
decreased appetite
decreased sensation, especially in your hands or feet
prolonged bleeding
seizures
nausea
vomiting
high blood pressure
a metallic taste in your mouth"
acute kidney injury,"for acute kidney injury, how is acute kidney failure diagnosed??","If you have acute kidney failure, you may have generalized swelling. The swelling is due to fluid retention.
Using a stethoscope, your doctor may hear crackling in the lungs. These sounds can signal fluid retention.
Results of laboratory tests may also show abnormal values, which are new and different from baseline levels. Some of these tests include:
blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
serum potassium
serum sodium
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
urinalysis
creatinine clearance
serum creatinine
An ultrasound is the preferred method for diagnosing acute kidney failure. However, abdominal X-ray, abdominal CT scan, and abdominal MRI can help your doctor determine if there�s a blockage in your urinary tract.
Certain blood tests may also reveal underlying causes of acute kidney failure."
acute kidney injury,"for acute kidney injury, what is the treatment for acute kidney failure??","Your treatment will depend on the cause of your acute kidney failure. The goal is to restore normal kidney function. Preventing fluids and wastes from building up in your body while your kidneys recover is important. In the majority of cases, a kidney specialist called a �nephrologist� makes an evaluation.
Diet
Your doctor will restrict your diet and the amount of liquids you eat and drink. This will reduce the buildup of toxins that the kidneys would normally eliminate. A diet high in carbohydrates and low in protein, salt, and potassium is usually recommended.
Medications
Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to treat or prevent any infections that occur at the same time. Diuretics may help your kidneys eliminate fluid. Calcium and insulin can help you avoid dangerous increases in your blood potassium levels.
Dialysis
You may need dialysis, but it�s not always necessary, and it will likely only be temporary. Dialysis involves diverting blood out of your body into a machine that filters out waste. The clean blood then returns to your body. If your potassium levels are dangerously high, dialysis can save your life.
Dialysis is necessary if there are changes in your mental status or if you stop urinating. You may also need dialysis if you develop pericarditis or inflammation of the heart. Dialysis can help eliminate nitrogen waste products from your body."
acute kidney injury,"for acute kidney injury, what are the complications of acute kidney failure??","Some of the complications of acute kidney failure include:
chronic kidney failure
heart damage
nervous system damage
end-stage renal failure
high blood pressure"
acute kidney injury,"for acute kidney injury, how can i prevent acute kidney failure??","Preventing and treating illnesses that can lead to acute kidney failure is the best method for avoiding the disease. According to the Mayo Clinic, having a healthy lifestyle that includes regular physical activity and a sensible diet can help to prevent kidney failure. Work with your doctor to manage existing medical conditions that could lead to acute kidney failure."
acute kidney injury,"for acute kidney injury, what is the long-term outlook??","Acute kidney failure can be a life-threatening illness. Chronic renal failure or end-stage renal disease can develop. There�s a greater risk of death if kidney failure is caused by severe infection, trauma, or surgery.
The following can also increase the risk of death:
lung disease
recent stroke
advanced age
blood loss
progressive kidney failure
With proper treatment and diligence, your chances of recovery are good. Seek immediate and regular medical care for acute kidney failure, and ask your doctor questions about what you can do to heal faster."
mitral valve prolapse,what is mitral valve prolapse? Tell me about mitral valve prolapse? What kind of disease is mitral valve prolapse? Can you elaborate on mitral valve prolapse? What can you tell me about mitral valve prolapse? Could you describe what mitral valve prolapse is? I�d like to know more about mitral valve prolapse. Can you help? What information do you have on mitral valve prolapse? Could you provide information on mitral valve prolapse?,"What is mitral valve prolapse?
You have two chambers on the left side of your heart: your left atrium and your left ventricle. Your mitral valve, which is located between the two, is designed to allow blood flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle, but not back the other way.
In mitral valve prolapse (MVP), also called Barlow�s syndrome, the flaps of the mitral valve don�t close correctly. Instead, the valve bulges into the atrium. This can lead to mitral valve regurgitation, which means that blood leaks back into the left atrium through the prolapsed valve.
Only about 2 percent
of Americans have mitral valve prolapse, according to the American Heart Association. And among these cases, serious complications are uncommon. Most of the time, people with MVP don�t have any symptoms, and it doesn�t affect their daily lives."
mitral valve prolapse,"for mitral valve prolapse, what are risk factors for mitral valve prolapse??","Experts don�t know exactly what causes MVP. Most people are born with abnormalities that cause the condition. These may include mitral valve flaps that are too big, thick, or stretchy.
The Cleveland Clinic reports that MVP is most commonly found in females. It�s also found more often in people born with disorders of the connective tissue (collagen, ligaments, tendons, and so on).
MVP often runs in families, so you may be more likely to have it if your parents or other relatives do.
Certain conditions may lead to mitral valve prolapse. These include:
scoliosis, or curvature of the spine
adult polycystic kidney disease, a genetic condition in which large cysts interfere with kidney function
connective tissue problems such as Marfan�s syndrome, a genetic condition that affects the connective tissue of the skeletal and cardiovascular systems, eyes, and skin"
mitral valve prolapse,"for mitral valve prolapse, what are the symptoms of mitral valve prolapse??","Because mitral valve prolapse often causes no symptoms, most people with this condition are unaware that they have heart problems.
If you do develop symptoms, they will generally be mild. The onset of symptoms is typically slow and gradual rather than abrupt.
When symptoms do occur, they may include:
cough
dizziness
fatigue and tiredness
shortness of breath, especially during exercise or when lying flat
You might also develop migraines (recurring headaches that can cause nausea) or experience pain in your chest. This pain is not caused by heart muscle blood flow seen with heart attacks. Your heartbeat might feel fast or irregular."
mitral valve prolapse,"for mitral valve prolapse, how is mitral valve prolapse diagnosed??","Your doctor will generally perform several tests to better understand your heart before making a diagnosis.
In most cases, your doctor will initially detect MVP when using a stethoscope to listen to your heart. If you have the condition, your heart may make a clicking sound when it beats. This sound is usually more noticeable when you are standing. Hearing this click might lead your doctor to order further tests.
Your doctor may order an X-ray or an echocardiogram. Both of these tests provide images of your heart, but the echocardiogram shows more structural details. Your doctor can check the images to see if you have MVP or regurgitation. Depending on your condition, your doctor may also perform a cardiac catheterization. In this procedure, dye (which is visible on X-rays) is injected into the arteries of your heart using a catheter (tube) that has been threaded through a blood vessel in your neck, arm, or upper thigh.
Your doctor might ask you to exercise on a treadmill or perform some other physical activity to see how your heart responds. This is called a stress test.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a way to check your heartbeat for irregularities. It is a recording of a few seconds of your heart�s electrical activity. This can help your doctor diagnose mitral valve prolapse or other heart conditions."
mitral valve prolapse,"for mitral valve prolapse, how is mitral valve prolapse treated??","In most cases, you won�t need any treatment for mitral valve prolapse. However, if you have noticeable symptoms, your doctor might choose to treat your condition.
Treatment often involves taking medications to help relieve any symptoms you�re experiencing. Possible medications your doctor might prescribe include:
aspirin to reduce the risk of blood clots
beta blockers to prevent your heart from beating irregularly and to improve blood flow
blood thinners to prevent blood clots
diuretics to remove excess fluid from the lungs
vasodilators to widen the blood vessels and improve blood flow
If your condition is more serious, such as if you have severe regurgitation or impaired heart function, you may need surgery. There are two basic types of surgery for this issue: valve replacement and valve repair. Your doctor will generally opt to repair the valve if possible.
If repairing the valve isn�t possible, it may be replaced with either a man-made mechanical valve or a biological valve harvested from a cow or pig or created from human tissue. There are pros and cons to both kinds of valves, so your doctor will discuss your options with you before the procedure."

A vast network of nerves controls the movement of the muscles in our bodies. If a part of this network is damaged, muscles in the affected area may not work properly.
There are several factors that can cause paresis, and there are many different types of paresis. Paresis is often categorized by the area of the body that�s impacted."
partial paralysis,"for partial paralysis, how is paresis different from paralysis??","Paresis is characterized by muscle weakness. A person with paresis can still move the affected muscle or muscles. However, these movements are weaker than normal.
Paresis is different from paralysis. An individual who has paralysis isn�t able to move a specific muscle or muscle group at all.
You may also see paresis used as a suffix to distinguish what part of the body is affected. For example, a person with monoparesis has muscle weakness affecting one limb.
The corresponding suffix for paralysis is �-plegia.� Using the same example, a person with monoplegia has paralysis that affects one limb."
partial paralysis,"for partial paralysis, causes and types of paresis?","There are many different factors that can cause nerve damage that results in paresis.
Several examples of causes include:
head injury
spinal cord injury
pressure on the spinal cord or nerves due to things like inflammation, bone spurs, or a tumor
stroke
seizures
multiple sclerosis (MS)
cerebral palsy
diabetes
certain infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus and syphilis
Guillain-Barr� syndrome
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
Just as there are many potential causes of paresis, there are also many different types of paresis.
Below are several examples of different types of paresis:
Monoparesis. Monoparesis muscle weakness that affects one limb, such as a leg or an arm.
Paraparesis. Paraparesis is muscle weakness that affects both legs.
Hemiparesis. Hemiparesis is muscle weakness that affects one side of your body, such as the left arm and left leg.
Quadriparesis. Quadriparesis is muscle weakness that affects all four limbs.
Bell�s palsy. Bell�s palsy is a condition that leads to temporary weakness in your facial muscles, which can cause facial drooping and pain.
Vocal cord paresis. Vocal cord paresis affects the movement of your vocal cords. The condition often leads to a soft voice or hoarseness, as well as feelings of breathlessness when speaking.
Gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is a condition where the emptying of the stomach is impaired due to muscle weakness. It�s associated with symptoms like nausea, vomiting, bloating, and feeling full quickly.
Todd�s paresis. Todd�s paresis is a type of paresis that occurs following a seizure. It�s often associated with paresis in one limb (monoparesis) or on one side of the body (hemiparesis).
Neurosyphilis. Neurosyphilis occurs when a syphilis infection attacks the nervous system. It can cause paresis as well as headaches, changes in behavior, and dementia.
Spastic paresis. Spastic paresis is a condition that causes muscle overactivity and spasticity. It�s due to nerve damage that often results from conditions like stroke, MS, and cerebral palsy. This can lead to pain as well as difficulty with activities like walking or getting dressed."
partial paralysis,"for partial paralysis, what are the most common symptoms??","Muscle weakness is the main symptom of paresis.
Other common symptoms can include:
muscle stiffness
a tingling or �pins and needles� feeling
decreased sensation in the affected area
Some types of paresis may have slightly different or additional symptoms.
Symptoms of paresis can come on suddenly, as in the case of a head or spinal cord injury. They may come on gradually in other instances, such as with a condition like MS.
Depending on the cause, symptoms may be temporary or permanent. They may also progressively get worse, leading to paralysis, as with ALS."
partial paralysis,"for partial paralysis, treatment options?","Treatment for paresis depends on what�s causing it. It focuses on addressing any underlying conditions and improving quality of life.
Examples of possible treatment options include:
Physical therapy. Physical therapy uses techniques such as exercise and massage to aid in promoting mobility, improving flexibility and range of motion, and stimulating your nerves and muscles.
Occupational therapy. Occupational therapy can teach you strategies for carrying out your day-to-day activities more easily while you�re experiencing paresis.
Assistive devices. Assistive devices are items that can help with your mobility and daily activities. Examples include:
walkers
wheelchairs
grab bars
specialized handles and grips
voice-activated technology
Medications. In some cases, medications may help treat a condition that�s causing paresis. Examples include:
antimicrobial medications for infections
corticosteroids to reduce inflammation that�s putting pressure on a nerve"
partial paralysis,"for partial paralysis, the bottom line        ?","Paresis involves the weakening of a muscle or group of muscles. It may also be referred to as partial or mild paralysis. Unlike paralysis, people with paresis can still move their muscles. These movements are just weaker than normal.
Paresis occurs when nerves are damaged. When this happens, muscles that are served by the affected nerve may not function properly.
There are a variety of different causes of paresis, including injury, stroke, spinal cord inflammation, and conditions like MS.
There�s currently no cure for paresis. Some types of paresis are temporary and will go away over time, while others may be permanent. Sometimes, however, treatments that focus on the underlying cause can help it improve or completely resolve.
Your healthcare provider can work with you to create the right treatment method based on your needs. Proper treatment can help you manage your condition, and improve your mobility and quality of life."

Could you provide information on paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea?,"Overview
Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) causes sudden shortness of breath during sleep. As a result, you wake up gasping for air. It tends to occur within a few hours after you�ve fallen asleep.
The condition can also be defined by the meaning of its name:
Dyspnea can occur at any time of the day or night. It�s a potential symptom of a number of serious respiratory and circulatory diseases, including:
Read on to find out what health conditions can cause PND, and how it�s treated."
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,"for paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea vs. sleep apnea?","PND is a symptom that can be caused by a number of different respiratory and circulatory conditions. Sleep apnea, most commonly obstructive sleep apnea, on the other hand, is a medical condition on its own. Sleep apnea can cause PND, but not vice versa.
People who have sleep apnea experience multiple episodes of slowed or stopped breathing during the night. Sometimes breathing is interrupted for long enough to cause PND and wake you up.
In obstructive sleep apnea, breathing slows or stops altogether because of a physical tissue obstruction to the upper airway. In central sleep apnea, breathing slows or stops altogether because the brain doesn�t send the signals required to breathe properly.
Both types of sleep apnea can cause PND. However, not all cases of PND are caused by sleep apnea."
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,"for paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, what are the symptoms??","PND tends to occur within a few hours after you�ve fallen asleep. It wakes you up. You might gasp for air, cough, or sit or stand up to try to open your airways. After a while, your breathing may return to normal. It might take a half an hour, or sometimes longer, to recover.
Many people find it difficult to return to sleep after an episode of PND. PND can be distressing, and one or more episodes may lead to sleep anxiety or even insomnia.
If sitting or standing up doesn�t relieve symptoms of PND, you should call for emergency medical assistance right away."
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,"for paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, common causes?","There is a lack of consensus over the term �paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.� Some medical professionals use it to refer exclusively to a symptom of heart failure. In other cases, it�s used to describe nighttime shortness of breath caused by other medical conditions, some of which are benign.
Some of the most common causes of nighttime shortness of breath are described below.
Heart failure
Heart failure, also known as congestive heart failure, occurs when the heart muscle struggles to adequately pump blood throughout the body. It can lead to fluid buildup in the lungs (pulmonary edema) and around the lungs, which can make it difficult to breathe. Many people with heart failure also experience difficulty breathing when exerting themselves or laying down.
Respiratory conditions
PND can also be related to lung and respiratory system function. Respiratory conditions that can cause or lead to PND include:
asthma
COPD
postnasal drip
pulmonary edema
sleep apnea
pulmonary artery embolism
restrictive lung disease
Other medical conditions
PND can also be related to a variety of other conditions. Some of these include:
stomach acid reflux
kidney failure
anxiety or panic attacks
PND is serious. You should see a doctor to determine what�s causing your nighttime shortness of breath."
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,"for paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, how it�s diagnosed?","Your doctor will try to determine the underlying cause of your PND. They�ll ask you about your medical history and symptoms, and conduct tests to assess your heart and lungs.
Diagnostic tests can include one or more of the following:
biopsy
blood tests
bronchoscopy
chest CT scan
chest X-ray
coronary artery angiogram
echocardiogram, or a cardiac ultrasound
12-lead electrocardiogram
chest MRI scan
pulmonary function test (spirometry testing)
cardiac stress test
thoracoscopy"
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,"for paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, how it�s treated?","Treatments for PND vary depending on the cause. Your doctor can help you understand the best course of treatment based on your symptoms.
For people whose PND is caused by heart failure, a number of treatments may improve symptoms. Medical treatment can include diuretic therapy to reduce fluid retention and cardiac medication therapy to protect the heart or reduce blood pressure or heart rate. Other treatments, including surgery, may help to decrease the workload on the heart and provide the cells with additional oxygen. Sleeping propped up on several pillows may also provide relief from PND.
When PND is caused by a lung or other respiratory system disorder, treating the disorder usually helps to ease symptoms. For instance, long-term asthma control medications can help to reduce shortness of breath at night. In cases of sleep apnea, a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine, possibly with added supplemental oxygen, may help to improve breathing.
Stomach acid reflux is treatable with lifestyle changes and antacids.
Other treatments focus on reducing stress and improving the overall quality of your sleep. Avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed and adopting a regular sleep schedule are just a few things you can do to improve the overall quality of your sleep."
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,"for paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, what�s the outlook??","Heart failure is one of the most serious causes of PND. The outlook for heart failure depends on the underlying cause, as well as risk factors, lifestyle, and treatments. The course of the disease varies a lot from one person to the next. Heart failure is typically long term and usually gets worse over time, but a number of available treatments can slow its progression and help to prevent acute decompensatory episodes.
Other conditions that cause PND, such as asthma, stomach acid reflux, or sleep apnea, are generally highly treatable. If you experience PND, you should make an appointment with a doctor to identify or confirm the cause.
In addition, remember to seek emergency medical attention if you experience severe or ongoing shortness of breath or chest pain."
pulmonary edema,what is pulmonary edema? Tell me about pulmonary edema? What kind of disease is pulmonary edema? Can you elaborate on pulmonary edema? What can you tell me about pulmonary edema? Could you describe what pulmonary edema is? I�d like to know more about pulmonary edema. Can you help? What information do you have on pulmonary edema? Could you provide information on pulmonary edema?,"Pulmonary edema is a serious condition that occurs when the lungs fill with fluid. This prevents the body from gaining the oxygen it needs. It is typically caused by another condition, such as heart failure or altitude sickness.
Pulmonary edema is a condition in which the lungs fill with fluid. It�s also known as lung congestion, lung water, and pulmonary congestion. When pulmonary edema occurs, the body struggles to get enough oxygen, and you may experience shortness of breath or wheezing.
Pulmonary edema can range in severity. Some people may need critical care. Often, treatment involves treating pulmonary edema along with the related underlying condition.
Timely treatment can improve possible outcomes."
pulmonary edema,"for pulmonary edema, causes of pulmonary edema?","Several possible health conditions and external factors can cause pulmonary edema.
Congestive heart failure
Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a common cause
of pulmonary edema.
Heart failure happens when the heart can no longer pump blood properly throughout the body. This creates a backup of pressure in the small blood vessels in the lungs, which causes the vessels to leak fluid.
Typically, the lungs will take oxygen from the air you breathe and put it into the bloodstream. But when fluid fills your lungs, they cannot put oxygen into the bloodstream. This deprives the rest of the body of oxygen.
Other medical conditions
Other less common medical conditions that can cause pulmonary edema include:
heart attack, or other heart diseases
leaking, narrowed, or damaged heart valves
cardiomyopathy
cardiac arrhythmias
sudden high blood pressure
pneumonia
kidney failure
lung damage caused by severe infection
severe sepsis of the blood, or blood poisoning caused by infection
External factors
Some external factors can also put pressure on the heart and lungs and cause pulmonary edema. These include:
high altitude exposure
drug misuse or overdose
lung damage caused by inhalation of toxins
severe trauma
major injury
near drowning"
pulmonary edema,"for pulmonary edema, symptoms of pulmonary edema?","In cases of pulmonary edema, your body cannot gain oxygen effectively. This is due to the increasing fluid in the lungs preventing oxygen from moving into the bloodstream. Symptoms may continue to worsen until you get treatment.
Symptoms depend on the type of pulmonary edema.
Long-term pulmonary edema
The symptoms of long-term pulmonary edema include:
shortness of breath when physically active
difficulty breathing when lying down
wheezing
waking up at night with a breathless feeling that goes away when you sit up
rapid weight gain, especially in the legs
edema, or swelling in the lower part of the body
fatigue
High-altitude pulmonary edema
Pulmonary edema due to altitude sickness, or not getting enough oxygen in the air, will have symptoms that include:
headaches
irregular, rapid heart rate
shortness of breath after exertion and during rest
coughing
fever
difficulty walking uphill and on flat surfaces
You may need emergency assistance if these symptoms start to get worse. Call 911 or your local emergency services or have someone drive to you the hospital. If you may have pulmonary edema, you should not drive yourself to the hospital."
pulmonary edema,"for pulmonary edema, when is it an emergency??","Pulmonary edema can be an emergency.
Call 911 or your local emergency services immediately for medical help if you experience any of these symptoms:
extreme breathing difficulties, or shortness of breath, like suffocating or drowning
inability to breathe
anxiety related to trouble breathing
cough that produces a pink, frothy mix of saliva and mucus
chest pain
rapid, irregular heart rate
blue or gray skin tone
sweating along with breathing difficulties
These may be symptoms of acute pulmonary edema. Acute pulmonary edema develops suddenly. If left untreated, the fluid in your lungs can cause you to drown."
pulmonary edema,"for pulmonary edema, diagnosis of pulmonary edema?","If a doctor suspects you may have pulmonary edema, they may look for fluid in your lungs or symptoms caused by it. They may perform a basic physical examination and listen to your lungs with a stethoscope, looking for:
an increased heart rate
rapid breathing
a crackling sound from your lungs
any abnormal heart sounds
A doctor may also look for some signs on your body. These may include:
fluid buildup around your neck
swelling in your legs and abdomen
pale or blue tones in your skin
cold, clammy skin
The doctor may discuss your symptoms and ask about your medical history. They may order additional tests if they believe you have fluid in your lungs.
Examples of tests used in diagnosing pulmonary edema include:
complete blood count
echocardiogram, or an ultrasound, to check for abnormal heart activity
chest X-ray to see fluid
blood tests to check oxygen levels
electrocardiogram (ECG) to look for heart rhythm problems or signs of a heart attack"
pulmonary edema,"for pulmonary edema, treatment of pulmonary edema?","Pulmonary edema is a serious condition that requires quick treatment. Treatment for pulmonary edema may include
:
Oxygen
Oxygen may be the first line of treatment for this condition, depending on the severity. A healthcare team may prop you up and deliver 100 percent oxygen through an oxygen mask, nasal cannula, or positive pressure mask.
Diuretics
In less severe cases, it may be treated with diuretics, or water pills. You may not have to stay in the hospital. This may be the case if you have congestive heart failure.
Treatment of the underlying condition
A doctor will also diagnose the cause of pulmonary edema and prescribe the appropriate treatment for the underlying cause.
Depending on your condition and the cause of your pulmonary edema, the doctor may also prescribe:
Preload reducers: These help decrease pressure from the fluid going into your heart and lungs. Diuretics also help reduce this pressure by making you urinate, which eliminates fluid.
Afterload reducers: These medications dilate your blood vessels and take pressure off your heart.
Heart medications: These will control your pulse, reduce high blood pressure, and relieve pressure in arteries and veins.
Morphine: This narcotic is used to relieve anxiety and shortness of breath. But fewer doctors today use morphine due to its risks.
Intensive or critical care
In severe cases, people with pulmonary edema may need intensive or critical care.
In other cases of pulmonary edema, you may need treatment to help you breathe. A machine will deliver oxygen under pressure to help get more air into your lungs. Sometimes this can be done with a mask or cannula, also called continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).
Your doctor may need to insert an endotracheal tube, or breathing tube, down your throat and use mechanical ventilation."
pulmonary edema,"for pulmonary edema, pulmonary edema vs. pleural effusion?","Pulmonary edema is sometimes confused with pleural effusion, another condition involving fluid buildup in the lungs. However, pleural effusion causes a buildup of fluids in the pleural tissues. These cover the outside of each of your lungs as well as the inside of the chest wall.
Causes of pleural effusion may include
:
CHF
inadequate nutrition
pneumonia or tuberculosis
liver cirrhosis
pancreatitis
lupus
rheumatoid arthritis
cancer
With pleural effusion, you may experience:
breathing difficulties
a dry cough
shortness of breath
chest pain and discomfort
A chest X-ray can help diagnose pleural effusion. A doctor may take a biopsy from pleural tissues if they suspect cancer. Depending on the cause, pleural effusion may be treated with a combination of fluid removal techniques and surgery."
pulmonary edema,"for pulmonary edema, pulmonary edema vs. pneumonia?","Pneumonia is another serious condition of the lungs. Unlike edema, pneumonia is caused by viral, fungal, or bacterial infection. As your lungs become infected, fluid builds up in the air sacs (alveoli).
While pulmonary edema and pneumonia cause buildup in the lungs, the former is primarily caused by CHF. Pneumonia, on the other hand, is caused by an infection. A weakened immune system can increase your chances of getting pneumonia from a common cold or flu.
Symptoms of pneumonia may include:
high fever with chills
cough with mucus that continues to worsen
chest pain and discomfort
shortness of breath
nausea or vomiting
diarrhea
According to the American Lung Association, pneumonia is one of the most common causes of hospitalization in children and adults.
If left untreated, this condition can lead to
:
pleural effusion
lung abscesses
respiratory failure
septic shock
kidney failure
Pulmonary edema isn�t a cause of pneumonia. However, the buildup of fluids from pneumonia can lead to pleural effusion. Pneumonia requires immediate treatment to prevent complications. It may require antibiotics and oxygen therapy."
pulmonary edema,"for pulmonary edema, risk factors of pulmonary edema?","People with heart problems or heart failure are the most at risk for pulmonary edema. Other factors that may put a person at risk include:
history of pulmonary edema
history of lung disease, such as tuberculosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD)
vascular (blood) disorders"
pulmonary edema,"for pulmonary edema, prevention of pulmonary edema?","There is no way to fully prevent pulmonary edema. Those at high risk should seek immediate attention if they develop symptoms.
The best way to try and prevent pulmonary edema is by taking good care of your health:
Get a pneumonia vaccine
.
Get the flu vaccine, especially if you have heart problems or are an older adult.
Remain on diuretics after an episode of pulmonary edema to prevent a reoccurrence.
You can also decrease your risk for heart failure, the most common cause of pulmonary edema with the following steps:
Visit a doctor regularly.
Avoid smoking or quit smoking if you smoke.
Avoid illegal drugs.
Get regular exercise.
Eat nutritious foods.
Maintain your weight."
pulmonary edema,"for pulmonary edema, outlook for pulmonary edema?","The outlook for pulmonary edema depends on the severity. If you have a moderate case and receive quick treatment, you will often have a full recovery. Severe cases can be fatal if you delay treatment.
Be sure to see a doctor regularly and get immediate help if you experience any pulmonary edema symptoms.
If you need help finding a primary care doctor, you can browse doctors in your area through the Healthline FindCare tool."
pulmonary edema,"for pulmonary edema, takeaway?","Pulmonary edema is a health condition when the lungs fill with fluid. This fluid can prevent the body from effectively receiving oxygen.
You may experience shortness of breath after exertion and during rest. The severity can range from moderate to severe. Pulmonary edema requires prompt medical treatment.
Pulmonary edema occurs due to another condition, most commonly congestive heart failure. Treatment may involve treating pulmonary edema and its underlying cause.

Could you describe what lymphedema is? I�d like to know more about lymphedema. Can you help? What information do you have on lymphedema? Could you provide information on lymphedema?,"Lymphangitis is an inflammation of the lymphatic system. If it�s treated quickly, it often goes away with no ill effects. If left untreated, complications can occur, and the condition can become serious.
Your lymphatic system is a network of organs, cells, ducts, and glands. The glands are also called nodes and can be found throughout your body. They are most apparent under your jaw, in your armpits, and in your groin.
Organs that make up the lymphatic system include your:
Immune cells called lymphocytes mature within your bone marrow and then travel to your lymph nodes and other organs within the lymphatic system to help protect your body against viruses and bacteria. The lymphatic system also filters a whitish-clear fluid called lymph, which contains bacteria-killing white blood cells.
Lymph travels through your body along lymphatic vessels and collects fats, bacteria, and other waste products from cells and tissues. Your lymph nodes then filter these harmful materials out of the fluid and produce more white blood cells to fight off the infection.
Infectious lymphangitis occurs when viruses and bacteria invade the vessels of your lymphatic system, typically through an infected cut or wound. Tender red streaks often radiate from the wound toward the nearest lymph glands. Other symptoms include fever, chills, and a general sense of illness.
Lymphangitis is sometimes incorrectly called blood poisoning. It�s also sometimes mistaken for thrombophlebitis, which is a clot in a vein."
lymphedema,"for lymphedema, what causes lymphangitis??","Infectious lymphangitis occurs when bacteria or viruses enter the lymphatic channels. They may enter through a cut or wound, or they may grow from an existing infection.
The most common infectious cause of lymphangitis is acute streptococcal infection. It may also be the result of a staphylococcal (staph) infection. Both of these are bacterial infections.
Lymphangitis may occur if you already have a skin infection and it�s getting worse. This might mean that bacteria will soon enter your bloodstream. Complications such as sepsis, a life-threatening condition of body-wide inflammation, can occur as a result.
Conditions that increase your risk of lymphangitis include:
diabetes
immunodeficiency, or loss of immune function
chronic steroid use
chickenpox
A cat or dog bite or a wound made in fresh water can also become infected and lead to lymphangitis. Gardeners and farmers may develop the condition if they get sporotrichosis, a soil-borne fungal infection.
There are also noninfectious causes of lymphangitis. Inflammation of lymph vessels can occur due to malignancy: Breast, lung, stomach, pancreas, rectal, and prostate cancers are common types of tumors that can lead to lymphangitis. Lymphangitis has also been seen in those with Crohn�s disease."
lymphedema,"for lymphedema, what are the symptoms of this condition??","Red streaks often trace the surface of the skin from the infected area to the nearest lymph gland. They may be faint or very visible and tender to the touch. They may extend from a wound or cut. In some cases, the streaks may blister.
Other symptoms include:
chills
swollen lymph glands
fever
malaise, or a general ill feeling
loss of appetite
headache
aching muscles"
lymphedema,"for lymphedema, how is lymphangitis diagnosed??","To diagnose lymphangitis, your doctor will perform a physical exam. They�ll feel your lymph nodes to check for swelling.
Your doctor may also order tests such as a biopsy to reveal the cause of the swelling or a blood culture to see if the infection is present in your blood."
lymphedema,"for lymphedema, how is the condition treated??","Treatment should begin immediately to keep the condition from spreading. Your doctor may recommend the following:
antibiotics, if the cause is bacterial � in the form of oral medication or intravenous antimicrobial therapy, which involves antibiotics given directly into your veins
pain medication
anti-inflammatory medication
surgery to drain any abscesses that may have formed
surgical debridement, or removal, of a node if it�s causing obstruction
You can aid healing and ease the pain by using a hot compress at home. Run hot water over a washcloth or towel and apply it to the tender area. Do this three times a day. The warmth will promote blood flow and encourage healing. For the same reason, you might also want to take warm showers, positioning the showerhead over the infected area.
If possible, keep the infected area elevated. This helps reduce swelling and slows the spread of infection.
For mild pain relief, you can take over-the-counter medicines such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil). Ask your doctor about using these drugs if you have liver or kidney disease or if you�ve ever had a stomach ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding, such as bleeding in your intestines."
lymphedema,"for lymphedema, what are the complications of lymphangitis??","Lymphangitis can spread quickly, leading to complications such as:
cellulitis, a skin infection
bacteremia, or bacteria in your blood
sepsis, a body-wide infection that�s life-threatening
abscess, a painful collection of pus that�s usually accompanied by swelling and inflammation
If bacteria enter your bloodstream, the condition can be life-threatening. Visit your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any of the following:
increasing pain or redness at the site of the infection
growing red streaks
pus or fluid coming from the lymph node
fever over 101�F (38.3�C) for more than two days
Take antibiotics as prescribed to help prevent complications. Don�t miss a dose, especially in the first few days of treatment."
lymphedema,"for lymphedema, what is the long-term outlook??","If no complications occur, most people make a full recovery from lymphangitis. A full recovery may take weeks or months. Swelling and discomfort may be present in the meantime. The amount of time it takes to heal depends on the cause of the condition.
Immediate treatment for lymphangitis can help prevent complications. So if you suspect you have lymphangitis, see your doctor right away."

aortic valve stenosis,"for aortic valve stenosis, what are the symptoms of aortic valve stenosis in children and infants??","Infants and children may have different symptoms from adults, or they may not appear to display any symptoms at all. If they do display symptoms, these may include:
inability to put on weight
poor feeding or eating
becoming easily fatigued
breathing issues
In severe cases, an infant may have significant breathing difficulties that develop within weeks of birth. Without treatment, mild cases can potentially worsen as the child gets older."
aortic valve stenosis,"for aortic valve stenosis, what causes aortic valve stenosis??","Congenital heart defects, age-related damage, and certain health conditions may prevent the aortic valve from completing its proper functions.
Rheumatic fever
Rheumatic fever is a common cause
of heart valve problems in developing countries without effective antibiotic treatment. Rheumatic fever may affect many parts of the body, including the:
brain
joints
heart
skin
Rheumatic fever can occur in adults and children who have or have had strep throat. Strep throat is a contagious condition caused by Streptococcus bacteria.
Calcification of the valves
Aortic valve stenosis can happen due to calcium buildup (calcification) or scarring of the aortic valve. Aortic valve stenosis may occur in as many as 20% of older adults, according to the American Heart Association
. It is most common in people age 65 and older.
While your body needs calcium for strong bones, the mineral may lead to problems in your heart if it deposits in the aortic valve. Calcium deposits usually affect the leaflets of the aortic valve. They can prevent the aortic valve from properly opening and closing.
Improperly functioning aortic valve leaflets may also allow blood to leak back into the left ventricle after it enters the aorta. This is called valvular insufficiency or regurgitation.
It may also be more common
in people with certain health conditions, including lupus and end-stage renal disease.
Heart defect
Children may experience aortic valve stenosis due to a heart defect where the aortic valve doesn�t develop properly. When it is, the aortic valve�s flaps, or �leaflets,� irregularly formed. Typically, these leaflets make up the opening of the aortic valve. When functioning properly, they fit together tightly when closed.
Children born with aortic valve stenosis usually have one of the following irregularities in their aortic valve leaflets:
There are only one or two leaflets.
The leaflets don�t separate properly.
The leaflets are too thick or still to completely open or close.
Having an aortic valve with only two leaflets (a bicuspid aortic valve) can lead to increased calcification and then aortic stenosis."
aortic valve stenosis,"for aortic valve stenosis, who�s at risk for aortic valve stenosis??","The risk factors for aortic valve stenosis include:
Age
Adults over age 65
may be more likely to develop aortic valve stenosis.
Genetics
Children born with either malformed valve leaflets or fewer than three leaflets typically have problems with sufficient blood flow through the aorta.
Disease
Rheumatic fever can produce significant problems with the valve leaflets. Scar tissue from the disease can make the leaflets hard or even fused together. Rheumatic fever can damage:
heart tissue
valves
coronary arteries
Risk factors for quick progression
Some factors can cause aortic valve stenosis to progress more quickly. These can include:
a high BMI
tobacco use
metabolic syndrome
high cholesterol
high blood pressure"
aortic valve stenosis,"for aortic valve stenosis, how is aortic valve stenosis diagnosed??","After reporting your symptoms to a doctor, you may be referred to a heart specialist (cardiologist). They typically check your physical condition with a thorough examination. This includes listening to your heart for any abnormal sounds. A doctor typically orders an echocardiogram to view the condition of the heart chambers and heart valves.
The doctor may order additional tests to show what�s happening inside your heart. These tests may include:
cardiac catheterization, which uses dye to assess the pressure and flow of blood through the heart chambers
other imaging tests, such as a chest X-ray, chest MRI, or CT scan of your heart
a stress test
blood test for inflammation of the heart valve (endocarditis) or rheumatic fever"
aortic valve stenosis,"for aortic valve stenosis, how is aortic valve stenosis treated??","Early treatment may help prevent heart failure. Treatment options may depend on the severity of your condition and may include:
Heart-healthy lifestyle
If you have no symptoms or only mild ones, you may not require treatment. Doctors typically recommend maintaining a heart-healthy lifestyle to prevent disease progression. This can include:
adopting a heart-healthy diet
getting regular physical activity
maintaining a moderate weight
avoiding smoking, or quit smoking if you smoke
getting treatment for any severe sore throat to prevent rheumatic fever
practicing proper dental hygiene, as dental infections can travel through the bloodstream and damage the heart valves and muscles
managing your blood pressure
Procedures
If your aortic valve stenosis is moderate to severe or you�re experiencing symptoms, a doctor typically recommends a procedure or surgery to repair or replace the damaged valve. Procedures can include:
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR): This minimally invasive procedure replaces your damaged valve with one made from animal tissue.
Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR): This open-heart surgery replaces your damaged valve with a mechanical valve or a valve from a cow, pig, or human donor.
Valvuloplasty: This minimally invasive procedure repairs your existing valve. Surgeons typically perform it through a soft, thin tube called a catheter, which is less invasive than traditional surgery.
A doctor may recommend a specific procedure depending on your condition and overall health.
Medications
A doctor may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or reduce the burden on your heart. Medications can include:
Antibiotics: Rheumatic fever requires antibiotics to prevent the infection from advancing and causing heart damage.
Blood pressure medications: ACE inhibitors can help lower your blood pressure.
Blood thinners: Blood thinners can help prevent blood blots from forming.
Antiarrhythmics: Doctors may prescribe antiarrhythmic medications to manage your heart�s rhythm."
aortic valve stenosis,"for aortic valve stenosis, long-term outlook?","Your health may improve dramatically once you receive treatment. Surgical treatments for aortic valve stenosis may allow you to resume an active life. Your outlook depends on a combination of factors:
how long you�ve lived with the condition
the extent of damage to your heart
any complications that may arise from your condition
Without treatment, people with severe aortic valve stenosis typically live for 1 to 3 years
from diagnosis."
aortic valve stenosis,"for aortic valve stenosis, takeaway?","Doctors diagnose aortic valve stenosis when the aortic valve narrows and doesn�t open properly. People may not show symptoms until stenosis becomes severe. If untreated, aortic stenosis can lead to heart failure.
If you have no symptoms or only mild symptoms, treatment may focus on preventing the disease from worsening.
If your condition is moderate to severe, treatment may involve medical procedures to replace or repair the damaged valve."
fluid overload,what is fluid overload? Tell me about fluid overload? What kind of disease is fluid overload? Can you elaborate on fluid overload? What can you tell me about fluid overload? Could you describe what fluid overload is? I�d like to know more about fluid overload. Can you help? What information do you have on fluid overload? Could you provide information on fluid overload?,"Hypervolemia occurs if your body retains too much fluid. You can experience swelling, discomfort, and other symptoms. Untreated, hypervolemia can cause severe complications, including heart failure."
fluid overload,"for fluid overload, what is hypervolemia??","Hypervolemia is the condition of having too much fluid volume in your body. While the body normally has a certain amount of fluids, too much fluid can damage your health.
Fluids in the body can include:
water
blood
lymphatic fluid
If the amount of fluid gets too high, it can impact how fluids are moved through your body and negatively affect your organ function.
Keep reading to learn the signs and causes of hypervolemia and how doctors diagnose and treat the condition."
fluid overload,"for fluid overload, what are the signs and symptoms of hypervolemia??","The symptoms of hypervolemia can include:
swelling, also called edema, most often in the feet, ankles, wrists, and face
discomfort in the body, causing cramping, headache, and stomach bloating
high blood pressure caused by excess fluid in the bloodstream
shortness of breath caused by extra fluid entering your lungs and reducing your ability to breathe normally
heart problems, because excess fluid can speed up or slow your heart rate, harm your heart muscles, and increase the size of your heart
increased weight, caused by excess fluid
When it�s an emergency
If you experience severe symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, severe pain, or irregular heart rhythm, call 911 or your local emergency services, or visit a local emergency department.
Was this helpful?"
fluid overload,"for fluid overload, what causes hypervolemia??","Often, problems with your kidneys cause hypervolemia. This is because the kidneys normally balance the salts and fluids in your body.
But when they retain salt, they increase the body�s total sodium content, which increases your fluid content.
The most common causes of hypervolemia can include:
heart failure, specifically of the right ventricle
cirrhosis, often caused by excess alcohol consumption or hepatitis
kidney failure, often caused by diabetes and other metabolic disorders
nephrotic syndrome, a disorder that causes excess excretion of protein in the urine
premenstrual edema, or swelling that occurs prior to a woman�s menstrual cycle
pregnancy, which changes a woman�s hormonal balance and can result in fluid retention
You can also experience hypervolemia from being on an IV, which can cause your sodium levels to be unbalanced. It can also occur if you consume too much sodium."
fluid overload,"for fluid overload, how is hypervolemia diagnosed??","If you believe you�re experiencing hypervolemia, talk with a doctor. They can determine if you�re experiencing this condition.
First, a doctor typically conducts a physical exam. The key signs of hypervolemia include weight gain and swelling. One or more parts of your body may appear swollen, depending on whether or not you have been sitting, lying, or standing before your visit.
The doctor is also likely to perform a blood test to check your sodium levels. While your body�s total sodium levels will looked elevated if you have hypervolemia, your sodium levels in the blood work may be high, normal, or low.
Performing a sodium test on your urine can help determine if your kidneys are causing your hypervolemia or if there is another cause.
For renal failure, urinary sodium content is typically greater than 20 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L), while in cases of heart failure, cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome, it is typically less than 10 mEq/L.
If you are hospitalized, your care team may measure your fluid intake and output and your weight to check for hypervolemia."
fluid overload,"for fluid overload, can hypervolemia cause other conditions to develop??","Untreated hypervolemia can cause several complications, some of which can be life threatening. These can include:
pericarditis, or swelling of the heart tissues
heart failure
delayed wound healing
tissue breakdown
decreased bowel function"
fluid overload,"for fluid overload, how is hypervolemia treated??","Treatment of hypervolemia differs from person to person, depending on the cause of the condition.
Generally, people with hypervolemia may receive a round of diuretics. These medications remove excess fluid.
In severe cases, a doctor may recommend dialysis (fluid removal through the kidneys) and paracentesis (fluid removal through the belly).
The doctor may also require you to restrict your dietary sodium intake."
fluid overload,"for fluid overload, what is the outlook for hypervolemia??","While you recover from hypervolemia, a doctor may request that you weigh yourself daily to ensure you�re expelling the excess fluid in your body.
Many people who stick to a doctor�s treatment plans fully recover. This can be important for preventing severe complications.
If an underlying condition is causing your hypervolemia, treating the underlying condition may help your recovery.
Besides monitoring your weight, you can prevent a recurrence of fluid overload by:
tracking your fluid intake
following the fluid intake guidelines from a doctor
managing your thirst with sugar-free candies, ice chips, frozen grapes, and other low-fluid, thirst-quenching foods
ensuring you do not consume too much sodium"
fluid overload,"for fluid overload, takeaway?","Hypervolemia, or fluid overload, happens when there is too much fluid in your body. It can raise blood pressure, cause swelling, and impact organ function.
Doctors can diagnose and manage hypervolemia with medication, reduced fluid and sodium intake, and dialysis.
Many people with this condition can make a full recovery with proper treatment."
peptic ulcer,what is peptic ulcer? Tell me about peptic ulcer? What kind of disease is peptic ulcer? Can you elaborate on peptic ulcer? What can you tell me about peptic ulcer? Could you describe what peptic ulcer is? I�d like to know more about peptic ulcer. Can you help? What information do you have on peptic ulcer? Could you provide information on peptic ulcer?,"Some types of ulcers, like arterial ulcers, can take months to clear or may not even heal at all. Other types, like peptic or stomach ulcers, can take a month to heal with proper treatment.
An ulcer is a painful sore that is slow to heal and sometimes recurs. Ulcers aren�t uncommon. Why they appear and their corresponding symptoms typically depend on their underlying causes.
Ulcers can appear anywhere in or on your body, from the lining in your stomach to the outer layer of your skin.
Sometimes ulcers disappear on their own. Other times they require medical treatment to prevent serious complications."
peptic ulcer,"for peptic ulcer, the different types of ulcers?","There are a few types of ulcers, including:
arterial ulcers
venous ulcers
mouth ulcers
genital ulcers
Arterial ulcers
Arterial (ischemic) ulcers are open sores that primarily develop on the smaller side of arterioles and capillaries, most often around the outer side of your ankle, feet, toes, and heels.
Arterial ulcers develop from damage to the arteries due to a lack of blood flow to the tissue. Arterial ulcers are also sometimes found in the gut in individuals who are ill and have poor blood pressure in general.
These forms of ulcers can take months to heal and require proper treatment to prevent infection and further complications.
Arterial ulcers have a �punched out� appearance accompanied by a number of symptoms, including:
red, yellow, or black sores
hairless skin
leg pain
no bleeding
affected area cool to the touch from minimal blood circulation
Treatment for arterial ulcers depends on the underlying cause. Primary treatment includes restoring blood circulation to the affected area.
While antibiotics may help reduce symptoms, your doctor may recommend surgery to increase blood flow to your tissues and organs. In more severe circumstances, your doctor may recommend amputation.
Venous ulcers
Venous ulcers � the most common type of leg ulcers � are open wounds that often form on your leg, below your knee, and on the inner area of your ankle. They typically develop from damage to your veins caused by insufficient blood flow back to your heart.
In some cases, venous ulcers cause little to no pain unless they�re infected. Other cases of this condition can be very painful.
Other symptoms you may experience include:
inflammation
swelling
itchy skin
scabbing
discharge
Venous ulcers can take months to fully heal. In rare cases, they may never heal. Treatment focuses on improving flow to the affected area. Antibiotics can help prevent infection and reduce symptoms, but they aren�t enough to heal venous ulcers.
Alongside medication, your doctor may recommend surgery or compression therapy to increase blood flow.
Peptic ulcers
Peptic ulcers are sores or wounds that can develop on:
the inside lining of your stomach
the upper portion of your small intestine
your esophagus
They form when digestive juices damage the walls of your stomach or intestine. These ulcers are quite common.
Peptic ulcers are most often caused by inflammation after contracting Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria or through long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
There are two types of peptic ulcers:
gastric ulcers, or ulcers that develop in the stomach lining
duodenal ulcers, or ulcers that develop in the duodenum (small intestine)
The most common symptom of this condition is a burning sensation. Other symptoms may include:
bloating or the feeling of being full
belching
heartburn
nausea
vomiting
unexplained weight loss
chest pain
Treatment depends on the underlying cause of your ulcer. If you have an H. pylori infection, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to kill the harmful bacteria.
For the majority of peptic ulcer cases, acid-lowering medication regimens are generally prescribed to help protect the mucosal lining from stomach acid so it has time to heal.
Mouth ulcers
Mouth ulcers are small sores or lesions that develop in your mouth or the base of your gums. They�re commonly known as canker sores.
These ulcers are triggered by a number of causes
, including:
stress
hormonal changes
vitamin deficiencies
bacterial infection
diseases
Mouth ulcers are common and often go away within 2 weeks. They can be uncomfortable but shouldn�t cause significant pain. If a mouth ulcer is extremely painful or doesn�t go away within 2 weeks, seek immediate medical attention.
Minor mouth ulcers appear as small, round ulcers that leave no scarring. In more severe cases, they can develop into larger and deeper wounds. Other serious symptoms associated with this type of ulcer may include:
unusually slow healing (lasting longer than 3 weeks)
ulcers that extend to your lips
issues eating or drinking
fever
diarrhea
Mouth ulcers often go away on their own without treatment. If they become painful, your doctor or dentist may prescribe an antimicrobial mouthwash or ointment to reduce your discomfort.
If your condition is the result of a more serious infection, seek medical attention to receive the best treatment.
Genital ulcers
Genital ulcers are sores that develop on genital areas, including the penis, vagina, anus, or surrounding areas. They are usually caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but genital ulcers can also be triggered by trauma, inflammatory diseases, or even, in some cases
, an Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) infection.
In addition to sores, symptoms that may accompany genital ulcers include:
rash or bumps in the affected area
pain or itching
swollen glands in the groin area
fever
Similar to other types of ulcers, treatment depends on the underlying cause of your condition. In some cases, these sores will go away on their own. If diagnosed with an STI, your doctor may prescribe antiviral or antibiotic medication or ointment. If you feel you�ve been exposed to an STI, seek immediate medical attention."
peptic ulcer,"for peptic ulcer, stomach ulcer symptoms ?","The most common symptom of a peptic ulcer is stomach pain. Often, the pain starts in the center of your stomach and can travel up to your throat or seemingly down your back. This pain can last for a few minutes to a few hours and is usually only temporarily eased by antacids.
You may also feel ill if you have a stomach ulcer and may lose weight.
Serious complications of peptic ulcers include:
vomiting blood
passing dark, tarry stools
a sudden, sharp pain in your stomach that only gets worse, not better
There is no difference between stomach ulcer symptoms in men versus stomach ulcer symptoms in women; however, men are typically more predisposed to developing these types of ulcers, according to the National Health Service (NHS)."
peptic ulcer,"for peptic ulcer, do ulcers go away??","Most ulcers, no matter where they are on the body, are caused by underlying issues. Therefore, the answer to �do ulcers go away?� is directly related to how effective the treatment is for the underlying health issue.
Some ulcers, like peptic and genital ulcers, will go away but then reappear, even with treatment. If you find yourself dealing with chronic ulcers and haven�t yet pinned down a cause, it�s important to talk with your doctor immediately."
peptic ulcer,"for peptic ulcer, how long does it take for ulcers to heal??","The length of time it takes for your ulcer to heal depends on the type, as well as the severity of the ulcer itself.
For many peptic ulcers, the healing time is around a month or so with treatment.
Arterial ulcers can take several months to heal, or may not even heal at all.
With compression therapy, venous ulcers can be healed in a few months, although some may not heal at all.
Mouth ulcers, or canker sores, can take anywhere from a week to 4 weeks
to heal with treatment. However, many people have reoccurring mouth ulcers.
The amount of time it takes to heal genital ulcers really depends on what is causing them. For example, individuals living with genital herpes, which is a sexually transmitted disease, can treat their ulcers but cannot cure them, so they may periodically reappear.
Most ulcers will go away faster with the proper treatment."
peptic ulcer,"for peptic ulcer, takeaway?","Ulcers are sores that are slow to heal and sometimes reoccur. They can appear in many different parts of the body, from the stomach lining to the genital area.
While peptic ulcers are the most common kinds of ulcers, there is a variety of ulcer types, and many are caused by underlying conditions. Treatment of ulcers depends on what causes them.
Ulcers are common, and there are over-the-counter methods that can ease the discomfort they may cause. The quicker you talk with your doctor about your symptoms, the quicker you may be able to find relief."
kidney failure,what is kidney failure? Tell me about kidney failure? What kind of disease is kidney failure? Can you elaborate on kidney failure? What can you tell me about kidney failure? Could you describe what kidney failure is? I�d like to know more about kidney failure. Can you help? What information do you have on kidney failure? Could you provide information on kidney failure?,"Kidney failure occurs when your kidneys lose the ability to filter waste from your blood sufficiently. It may not cause symptoms in the early stages.
Your kidneys filter your blood and remove toxins from your body. These toxins go to your bladder and are eliminated when you urinate. When this doesn�t work properly, you can get kidney failure.
If your kidneys aren�t able to function properly, toxins can overwhelm your body. This can lead to kidney failure, which can be life threatening if left untreated.
Keep reading as we break down everything you need to know about kidney failure, including symptoms, stages, treatment, and the typical outlook."
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, types of kidney failure?","Acute kidney failure occurs when your kidneys suddenly stop working properly while chronic kidney failure occurs over time. Doctors typically divide kidney failure into five types.
The types of kidney failure include:
Acute prerenal kidney failure: Insufficient blood flow to the kidneys can cause acute prerenal kidney failure. Doctors can usually cure this type once they determine the cause of the decreased blood flow.
Acute intrinsic kidney failure: Acute intrinsic kidney failure can result from direct trauma to the kidneys, such as physical impact or an accident, toxin overload, and ischemia, which is a lack of oxygen to the kidneys.
Chronic prerenal kidney failure: When there isn�t enough blood flowing to your kidneys for an extended period of time, the kidneys can shrink and lose the ability to function.
Chronic intrinsic kidney failure: This happens when there�s long-term damage to the kidneys due to intrinsic kidney disease. Intrinsic kidney disease develops from direct trauma to the kidneys, such as severe bleeding or a lack of oxygen.
Chronic post-renal kidney failure: A long-term blockage of the urinary tract prevents urination. This causes pressure and eventual kidney damage.
Acute post-renal kidney failure: This type of kidney failure can occur due to stones or another blockage in the urinary tract."
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, symptoms of kidney failure?","Early-stage kidney failure often doesn�t cause noticeable symptoms. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
, about 90% of people with chronic kidney disease don�t know they have it.
As kidney disease progresses, symptoms may include:
reduced amount of urine
swelling of your legs, ankles, and feet from fluid retention
shortness of breath
trouble sleeping
muscle cramping at night
excessive drowsiness or fatigue
persistent nausea
confusion
chest pain or pressure
seizures
coma
Early signs of kidney failure
Symptoms of early-stage kidney disease may be subtle and hard to identify. They may include:
decreased urine output
swelling in limbs
shortness of breath
Kidney failure urine color
The color of your urine doesn�t tell you much about the state of your kidney function until damage to the kidneys has progressed.
Still, urine color changes may be an early indicator of some issues.
Urine color Indication
clear or pale yellow well-hydrated
dark yellow or amber dehydrated
orange dehydration or bile in the bloodstream
pink or red blood in the urine or having eaten certain foods, like beets
foamy contains a lot of protein; potentially an indicator of kidney disease"
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, causes of kidney failure?","Kidney failure can result from various causes. According to the National Kidney Foundation, the two most common include high blood pressure and diabetes.
People who are most at risk usually have one or more of the following:
Loss of blood flow to the kidneys
A sudden loss of blood flow to your kidneys can prompt kidney failure. Some causes include:
heart attack
heart disease
scarring of the liver or liver failure
dehydration
severe burns
allergic reactions
severe infection, such as sepsis
High blood pressure and anti-inflammatory medications can also limit blood flow.
Urine elimination problems
When your body can�t eliminate urine, toxins build up and overload the kidneys. Some cancers can block the urine passageways, such as:
prostate
colon
cervical
bladder
Other conditions can interfere with urination and possibly lead to kidney failure, including:
kidney stones
enlarged prostate
blood clots within your urinary tract
damage to the nerves that control your bladder
Other causes
Other factors that may lead to kidney failure include:
a blood clot in or around your kidneys
heavy metal poisoning
drugs and alcohol use
vasculitis, an inflammation of the blood vessels
lupus, an autoimmune disease that can cause inflammation of many body organs
glomerulonephritis, an inflammation of the small blood vessels of the kidneys
hemolytic uremic syndrome, which involves the breakdown of red blood cells following a bacterial infection, usually of the intestines
multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cells in your bone marrow
scleroderma, an autoimmune condition that affects your skin
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a disorder that causes blood clots in small vessels
chemotherapy drugs that treat cancer and some autoimmune diseases
dyes used in some imaging tests
certain antibiotics
unmanaged diabetes"
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, who gets kidney failure??","People of all ages develop kidney failure, but the risk increases
with age. According to the CDC, 14%
of U.S. adults have chronic kidney failure.
You may have a higher risk if you have:
diabetes
high blood pressure
heart disease
a family history of kidney failure
The longer you�ve had these conditions, the greater your risk
of chronic kidney failure."
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, diagnostic tests?","Doctors use several tests to diagnose kidney failure. Common tests include:
Urinalysis: A urine sample can show how much protein or sugar is in your urine. A urinary sediment examination looks for red and white blood cells, high levels of bacteria, and high numbers of cellular casts.
Urine volume measurements: Measuring urine output can help diagnose kidney failure. Low output may suggest that kidney disease is due to a urinary blockage.
Blood samples: Blood tests can measure substances filtered by your kidneys, such as blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. A rapid rise in these levels may indicate acute kidney failure.
Imaging: Tests like ultrasounds, MRIs, and CT scans provide images of your kidneys and urinary tract to identify issues.
Kidney tissue sample: Doctors use a kidney biopsy to collect and examine tissue samples."
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, chronic kidney disease stages?","Kidney disease is classified into five stages. These range from very mild (stage 1) to complete kidney failure (stage 5). Symptoms and complications increase as the stages progress.
Stage 1
You may experience no symptoms and have no visible complications. But some kidney damage is present.
Stage 2
Stage 2 kidney disease is still considered mild, but detectable issues like protein in the urine or physical damage to the kidneys may be more obvious.
It�s also a good idea to talk with a doctor about risk factors that could make the disease progress more rapidly, such as:
heart disease
inflammation
blood disorders
Stage 3
At this stage, your kidneys aren�t working as well as they should.
Stage 3 kidney disease is sometimes divided into stages 3a and 3b. A blood test that measures the amount of waste products in your body helps doctors differentiate between the two.
Symptoms may become more apparent. Swelling in hands and feet, back pain, and changes to urination frequency are likely.
A doctor may consider medications to treat underlying conditions that could speed kidney failure.
Stage 4
Stage 4 kidney disease is considered moderate to severe. The kidneys aren�t working well, but you�re not in complete kidney failure yet. Symptoms can include complications like:
anemia
high blood pressure
bone disease
A doctor will likely develop a treatment plan to slow kidney damage.
Stage 5
In stage 5, your kidneys are nearing or in complete failure. Symptoms of the loss of kidney function will be evident, such as vomiting and nausea, trouble breathing, and itchy skin.
You�ll need regular dialysis or a kidney transplant.
The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
estimates that approximately 1 in 500 Americans has stage 5 kidney failure."
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, treatment?","The type of treatment you need depends on the cause and stage of your kidney failure.
Dialysis
Dialysis filters and purifies the blood using a machine to performs the function of the kidneys. Depending on the type of dialysis, you may be connected to a large machine or a portable catheter bag.
Along with dialysis, you may need to follow a low potassium, low salt diet.
Dialysis doesn�t cure kidney failure, but going to regularly scheduled treatments can extend your life.
Kidney transplant
A transplanted kidney can work fully, so you no longer need dialysis.
There�s usually a long wait to receive a donor kidney that�s compatible with your body. If you have a living donor, the process may go more quickly.
Transplant surgery might not be the right treatment option for everyone. It is not always successful.
You must take immunosuppressant drugs after the surgery to prevent your body from rejecting the new kidney. These drugs have their own side effects, some of which can be serious.
You can talk with a doctor about whether you�re a good candidate for a kidney transplant.
Lifestyle modifications
Minimizing your intake of alcohol and making dietary changes may help prevent kidney failure from progressing.
At the early stages and beyond, it�s possible to manage and slow progression with lifestyle factors such as:
Dietary changes
The guidelines for what you eat will often depend on the stage of kidney disease you have and your overall health. Some recommendations might include:
Limiting sodium and potassium: Aim to eat less than 2,000 milligrams per day of both sodium (salt) and potassium.
Limiting phosphorus: Try to stay below 1,000 milligrams
of phosphorus.
Following protein guidelines: In early and moderate kidney disease, you might want to cut back on protein consumption. But you may eat more protein in end-stage kidney failure, depending on your doctor�s recommendations.
Beyond these general guidelines, a doctor may also ask you to avoid certain foods.
Lowering alcohol intake
If you have kidney failure and drink alcohol, your kidneys must work harder than they already do. Alcohol doesn�t metabolize out of your system, so if you have complete kidney failure, you�ll feel its effects until you receive dialysis to filter it from your blood.
Beer, ale, and wine also contain large amounts of phosphorous. Severe heart issues and death are possible if your kidneys cannot filter it out.
If you have kidney failure or late-stage kidney disease, a doctor may recommend you limit alcohol. Eliminating alcohol from your diet, if possible, may be best."
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, diabetes and kidney failure?","Diabetes is the most common cause of kidney failure. About one-third of adults
with diabetes have kidney disease.
Without management, high blood sugar can damage your kidneys. The damage can worsen over time.
Diabetic nephropathy, or kidney damage caused by type 1 or type 2 diabetes, can�t be reversed. Steps to prevent or limit kidney damage can include:
managing your blood sugar
managing blood pressure
taking medications as prescribed
If you have diabetes, a doctor will likely perform regular screenings to monitor for kidney failure. Your risk for diabetic nephropathy increases the longer you live with diabetes."
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, complications?","Kidney failure can lead to various complications. These can include:
anemia
bone weakness, due to an imbalance of phosphorus and calcium
fluid retention (edema)
heart disease
high potassium levels (hyperkalemia)
metabolic acidosis, when the blood becomes too acidic
Many people with kidney failure develop secondary complications. These can include:
depression
liver failure
fluid buildup in the lungs
gout
nerve damage
skin infections"
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, kidney failure outlook?","It�s not possible to know precisely how long a person with kidney failure will live, as it can depend on many factors.
These include:
the underlying cause
how well that underlying cause is managed
any complicating factors, like high blood pressure or diabetes
stage of kidney disease at diagnosis
age
The National Kidney Foundation says that a person on dialysis can expect to live for an average of 5 to 10 years as long as they follow their treatment. Some people live for more than 20 or 30 years.
Once you reach end-stage kidney failure, you will need dialysis or a kidney transplant to live. Missing even one dialysis treatment can decrease your life expectancy.
Proper treatment and healthy lifestyle changes may improve your outlook, such as avoiding certain foods."
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, kidney failure prevention?","You can take steps to lower the risk of kidney failure.
Follow directions when taking over-the-counter medications. Taking doses that are too high, even of common drugs like aspirin, can create high toxin levels quickly. This can overload your kidneys.
Many kidney or urinary tract conditions lead to kidney failure without prompt treatment.
You can help lower your risk of kidney failure by:
eating a balanced diet
maintaining a moderate weight
taking prescribed and over-the-counter medications as directed and not taking more medication than is safe
keeping conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, well managed and following a doctor�s advice"
kidney failure,"for kidney failure, the bottom line?","Kidney failure can develop suddenly or from long-term damage. Possible causes of kidney failure can include diabetes, high blood pressure, and kidney trauma.
Kidney disease is classified into five stages, ranging from mild to complete kidney failure. Symptoms and complications increase as the stages progress.

Could you describe what heart failure is? I�d like to know more about heart failure. Can you help? What information do you have on heart failure? Could you provide information on heart failure?,"Heart failure occurs when your heart cannot pump enough blood to support your body functions. Seek help immediately if you�re experiencing symptoms such as heart palpitations, shortness of breath, or swelling.
Heart failure is characterized by the heart�s inability to pump an adequate supply of blood to the body. Without sufficient blood flow, all major body functions are disrupted. Heart failure is a condition or a collection of symptoms that weaken or stiffen your heart.
In some people with heart failure, the heart has difficulty pumping enough blood to support other organs in the body. Other people may have a hardening and stiffening of the heart muscle itself, which blocks or reduces blood flow to the heart.
Heart failure can affect the right or left side of your heart or both at the same time. It can be either an acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing) condition.
About 6.2 million Americans
have heart failure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Most cases are diagnosed in men. However, women are more likely to die from heart failure when the condition goes untreated.
Heart failure is a serious medical condition that requires treatment. Early treatment increases your chances of long-term recovery with fewer complications. Call your doctor right away if you�re having any symptoms of heart failure."
heart failure,"for heart failure, what causes heart failure??","Heart failure is most often related to another condition. The most common cause of heart failure is coronary artery disease (CAD), a disorder that causes narrowing of the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart. Other conditions that may increase your risk of developing heart failure include:
cardiomyopathy, a disorder of the heart muscle that causes the heart to become weak
congenital heart disease
heart attack
heart valve disease
certain types of arrhythmias, or irregular heart rhythms
high blood pressure
emphysema, a disease of the lung
untreated sleep apnea
diabetes
an overactive or underactive thyroid
HIV
severe forms of anemia
certain cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy
substance misuse disorder"
heart failure,"for heart failure, what are the symptoms of heart failure??","The symptoms of heart failure may include:
fatigue
sudden weight gain
a loss of appetite
persistent coughing
irregular heart rate
heart palpitations
abdominal swelling
shortness of breath
exercise intolerance
leg and ankle swelling or abdomen
sleeping on extra pillows
getting short of breath while lying down
protruding neck veins"
heart failure,"for heart failure, what are the different types of heart failure??","Heart failure can occur in either the left or right side of your heart. It�s also possible for both sides of your heart to fail at the same time.
Heart failure is also classified as either diastolic or systolic.
Left-sided heart failure
Left-sided heart failure is the most common type of heart failure.
The left ventricle is located in the bottom left side of your heart. This area pumps oxygen-rich blood to the rest of your body.
Left-sided heart failure occurs when the left ventricle doesn�t pump efficiently. This prevents your body from getting enough oxygen-rich blood. The blood backs up into your lungs instead, which causes shortness of breath and a buildup of fluid.
Right-sided heart failure
The right heart ventricle is responsible for pumping blood to your lungs to collect oxygen. Right-sided heart failure occurs when the right side of your heart can�t perform its job effectively.
It�s usually triggered by left-sided heart failure. The accumulation of blood in the lungs caused by left-sided heart failure makes the right ventricle work harder. This can stress the right side of the heart and cause it to fail.
Right-sided heart failure can also occur because of other conditions, such as lung disease or valve disease. Right-sided heart failure is marked by swelling of the lower extremities or abdomen. This swelling is caused by fluid backup in the legs, feet, and abdomen.
Diastolic heart failure
Diastolic heart failure occurs when the heart muscle becomes stiffer than normal. The stiffness, which is usually due to heart disease, means that your heart doesn�t fill with blood easily. This is known as diastolic dysfunction. It leads to a lack of blood flow to the rest of the organs in your body.
Diastolic heart failure is more common in people who are female than in those who are male.
Systolic heart failure
Systolic heart failure occurs when the heart muscle loses its ability to contract. The contractions of the heart are necessary to pump oxygen-rich blood out to the body. This problem is known as systolic dysfunction, and it usually develops when your heart is weak and may be enlarged.
Systolic heart failure is more common in males than in females.
Both diastolic and systolic heart failure can occur on the left or right sides of the heart. You may have either condition on both sides of the heart."
heart failure,"for heart failure, what are the risk factors for heart failure??","Heart failure can happen to anyone. However, certain factors may increase your risk of developing this condition.
There is a higher incidence of heart failure in men compared with women, though the prevalence is about the same for all sexes.
People with diseases that damage the heart are also at an increased risk. These conditions include:
hypertension
sleep apnea
diabetes
coronary artery disease
valve disease
anemia
hyperthyroidism
hypothyroidism
emphysema
Certain behaviors can also increase your risk of developing heart failure, including:
smoking
eating foods that are high in fat or cholesterol
not getting enough exercise
having overweight or obesity"
heart failure,"for heart failure, how is heart failure diagnosed??","Physical exam
Your doctor may perform a physical exam to check for signs of heart failure. For instance, leg swelling, irregular heart rate, and bulging neck veins may lead your doctor to diagnose heart failure.
Echocardiogram
An echocardiogram is the most effective way to diagnose heart failure. It uses sound waves to create detailed pictures of your heart, which help your doctor evaluate the damage to your heart, the squeezing and relaxing function and determine the underlying causes of your condition.
Your doctor may use an echocardiogram along with other tests.
Other tests
chest X-ray This test can provide images of the heart and the surrounding organs.
heart MRI An MRI produces images of the heart without the use of radiation.
nuclear scan A very small dose of radioactive material is injected into your body to create images of the chambers of your heart.
catheterization or coronary angiogram In this type of X-ray exam, the doctor inserts a catheter into your blood vessel, usually in the groin or arm. They then guide it into the heart. This test can show how much blood is currently flowing through the heart.
stress exam During a stress exam, an EKG machine monitors your heart function while you run on a treadmill or perform another type of exercise.
Holter monitoring Electrode patches are placed on your chest and attached to a small machine called a Holter monitor for this test. The machine records the electrical activity of your heart for at least 24 to 48 hours.
BNP blood test A BNP test is done by drawing blood from a vein in your arm. This test can detect a rise in B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) hormone, which can be an indication of heart failure."
heart failure,"for heart failure, how is heart failure treated??","Treating heart failure depends on the severity of your condition and the type of heart failure you have.
Early treatment can improve symptoms fairly quickly, but you should still get regular testing and follow up with your doctor every 3 to 6 months. The main goal of treatment is to increase your lifespan.
Treatment of heart failure may include one or more of the following:
medication
bypass surgery
percutaneous coronary intervention
a pacemaker
an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
transplant surgery
Let�s take a closer look at each of these treatments and what they entail.
Medication
Early stages of heart failure may be treated with medications to help relieve your symptoms and prevent your condition from getting worse. Certain medications are prescribed to:
improve your heart�s ability to pump blood
reduce blood clots
reduce your heart rate, when necessary
remove excess sodium and replenish potassium levels
reduce cholesterol levels
reduce adverse hormones and reactions that occur in your body that can make the heart weaker
These medications can include:
blood thinners
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)
beta-blockers
calcium channel blockers
cholesterol-lowering medications
nitrates
angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI)
sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors
hydralazine
ivabradine in some cases
verquvo (vericiguat) in some cases
Always speak with your doctor before taking new medications. Some medications are completely off-limits to people with heart failure, including naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) and ibuprofen (Advil, Midol).
Surgery
Bypass surgery
Some people with heart failure will need surgery, such as coronary bypass surgery. During this surgery, your surgeon will take a healthy piece of an artery or vein and attach it to the blocked coronary artery. This allows the blood to bypass the blocked, damaged artery and flow through the new one.
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
Your doctor may also suggest a procedure known as a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In this procedure, a catheter with a small balloon attached is inserted into the blocked or narrowed artery. Once the catheter reaches the damaged artery, your surgeon inflates a balloon to open the artery.
Your surgeon may need to place a permanent stent, or wire mesh tube, into the blocked or narrowed artery. A stent permanently holds your artery open and can help prevent further narrowing of the artery.
Pacemakers
Other people with heart failure will need pacemakers to help control heart rhythms. These small devices are placed into the chest. They can slow your heart rate when the heart is beating too quickly or increase your heart rate if the heart is beating too slowly. Pacemakers are often used along with bypass surgery as well as medications.
Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
An ICD is a battery-powered device that keeps track of your heart rate and will shock your heart if it detects an abnormal heart rhythm. This shock restores the heart rate back to a normal rhythm. An ICD is suggested for people with an ejection fraction (how much blood your heart pumps out with each contraction) less than 35 percent (if not due to blockages) and <30 percent if due to blockages.
Transplant surgery
Heart transplants are used in the final stages of heart failure when all other treatments have failed. During a transplant, your surgeon removes all or part of your heart and replaces it with a heart from a donor."
heart failure,"for heart failure, how can you prevent heart failure??","Some lifestyle measures can help treat heart failure and prevent the condition from developing. Maintaining a moderate weight and exercising regularly can significantly decrease your risk of heart failure. Reducing the amount of salt in your diet can also lower your risk.
Other habits that may prevent heart failure include:
limiting alcohol intake
not smoking
avoiding high fat foods
getting the right amount of sleep
staying active"
heart failure,"for heart failure, what are the complications of heart failure??","Untreated heart failure can eventually lead to congestive heart failure (CHF), a condition in which blood builds up in other areas of your body. In this potential life threatening condition, you may experience fluid retention in your limbs as well as in your organs, such as the liver and lungs.
Additional complications of heart failure can include:
stroke
thromboembolism
arrhythmias, like atrial fibrillation
kidney dysfunction
Heart attack
A heart attack may also occur because of a complication related to heart failure.
Call 911 or your local emergency services right away if you have these symptoms:
crushing chest pain
discomfort in the chest, such as squeezing or tightness
discomfort in the upper body, including numbness or a coldness
fatigue
dizziness
rapid heart rate
vomiting
nausea
cold sweats"
heart failure,"for heart failure, the bottom line?","Heart failure is usually a long-term condition that requires ongoing treatment to prevent complications. When heart failure is left untreated, the heart can weaken so severely that it causes a life threatening complication.
It�s important to recognize that heart failure can happen to anyone. It�s important to take lifelong preventive measures for your heart health. Always contact your doctor if you suddenly have any new or unexplained symptoms that may indicate a problem with your heart.
Because heart failure is most often a chronic condition, your symptoms will likely get worse over time. Medications and surgeries can help relieve your symptoms, but such treatments may not help if you have a severe case of heart failure. In some cases, heart failure can be life threatening.
The outlook and treatment of heart failure varies depending on the type of heart failure you have. Early treatment is key in preventing the most serious cases of heart failure."
pulmonary hypertension,what is pulmonary hypertension? Tell me about pulmonary hypertension? What kind of disease is pulmonary hypertension? Can you elaborate on pulmonary hypertension? What can you tell me about pulmonary hypertension? Could you describe what pulmonary hypertension is? I�d like to know more about pulmonary hypertension. Can you help? What information do you have on pulmonary hypertension? Could you provide information on pulmonary hypertension?,"Cor pulmonale is a condition that happens when a respiratory disorder results in high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries (pulmonary hypertension). The name of the condition is in Latin and means �pulmonary heart.�
It�s also known as right-sided heart failure because it occurs within the right ventricle of your heart. Cor pulmonale causes the right ventricle to enlarge and pump blood less effectively than it should. The ventricle is then pushed to its limit and ultimately fails.
It�s possible to prevent this condition by controlling the high pressure of the blood going to the lungs. But untreated pulmonary hypertension can eventually lead to cor pulmonale along with other related, life-threatening complications."
pulmonary hypertension,"for pulmonary hypertension, symptoms of cor pulmonale?","The symptoms of cor pulmonale may not be noticeable at first because they�re similar to the feelings you get after a hard workout. They include
:
shortness of breath
tiredness
an increased heart rate
lightheadedness
Over time, these symptoms will worsen and flare up even during periods of rest.
Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following symptoms:
chest pain
leg or feet swelling
fainting
excessive coughing
wheezing
excessive fatigue"
pulmonary hypertension,"for pulmonary hypertension, treatment of cor pulmonale?","In order to treat cor pulmonale, your doctor will need to treat
the underlying cause.
Prescription medications can help decrease blood pressure and help encourage oxygen flow back into the lungs. Diuretics may also be used to get rid of fluid retention and keep your blood sodium levels down. You may also take blood thinners to prevent blood clots.
Severe or advanced cases of cor pulmonale require more aggressive treatments like a heart or lung transplant. In other cases, you may need to have oxygen therapy."
pulmonary hypertension,"for pulmonary hypertension, causes of cor pulmonale?","The lungs depend on the heart to transport blood from the body to the lungs. Pulmonary hypertension occurs as a result of increased pressure in your lungs� arteries.
This increased pressure can then cause resistance in your heart�s right ventricle. It�s a result of having to overcome the high pressure in the lungs in order to force blood into them.
This increased pressure leads to cor pulmonale, and the result is ineffective transportation of blood to the lungs. This, in turn, will lead to decreased oxygen transport to the rest of the body.
Conditions or events that can cause this include:
pulmonary embolism
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
lung tissue damage
sleep apnea
cystic fibrosis
scleroderma
The most common cause of acute cor pulmonale is typically caused by a pulmonary embolism, which is a blood clot in the lungs. Chronic cor pulmonary most commonly results from COPD."
pulmonary hypertension,"for pulmonary hypertension, diagnosing cor pulmonale?","Cor pulmonale is diagnosed with a physical exam and medical testing. Abnormal heart rhythms, fluid retention, and protruding neck veins during a physical exam can indicate the presence of increased pressure and the possibility of cor pulmonale.
Blood tests to detect brain natriuretic peptides, which are amino acids secreted from the heart when it is stressed, may also be ordered.
A doctor may also insert
a right heart catheter to determine if there�s any dysfunction in the right ventricle of your heart. This procedure is known as right heart catheterization or Swan-Ganz catheterization."
pulmonary hypertension,"for pulmonary hypertension, exams and tests?","Beyond the diagnosis of cor pulmonary itself, the condition�s underlying cause needs to be discovered to provide the appropriate treatment.
Testing may include:
CT scans, which take images of parts of the body
An echocardiogram, which is like an ultrasound of your heart and helps your specialist to visualize the structures of your heart and identify any structural differences
chest X-rays, which take images of various parts of your chest
a lung scan, which is used to detect blood clots
lung function tests, which determine how well your lungs work
right heart catheterization
In rare cases, your doctor may also order a lung biopsy to see if any underlying tissue is damaged."
pulmonary hypertension,"for pulmonary hypertension, complications of cor pulmonale?","If not treated promptly, cor pulmonale can lead to the following complications:
An enlarged pulmonary artery
thickening of the walls of the right ventricle of the heart
severe shortness of breath
severe excessive fluid in your body
shock
death"
pulmonary hypertension,"for pulmonary hypertension, outlook for people with cor pulmonale?","The outlook for people with cor pulmonale ultimately depends on the management of pulmonary hypertension that results from the underlying cause.
Cor pulmonale can also cause difficulty breathing, and it is life-threatening when not treated.
Talk with your doctor if you notice any changes in how you feel, especially if you�re currently being treated for pulmonary hypertension. Your doctor may need to adjust your treatment plan to help prevent cor pulmonale."
pulmonary hypertension,"for pulmonary hypertension, lifestyle changes?","You can prevent cor pulmonale by taking care of your heart and lungs. Maintain a moderate weight, get regular exercise (when possible), and eat a well-balanced diet to avoid hypertension and heart disease.
Preventing the onset of lung disease may help prevent this condition. Avoiding smoking cigarettes can help reduce your risk of developing such an illness, which could damage your lungs and lead to cor pulmonale."

Could you provide information on dysphagia?,"Some health conditions can make swallowing foods or liquids more difficult. Treatment can include therapy, medications, and dietary changes.
Swallowing difficulty is the inability to swallow foods or liquids with ease. People who have a hard time swallowing may choke on their food or liquid when trying to swallow. Dysphagia is the medical name for difficulty swallowing.
Dysphagia affects about 15 million people in the United States. About 1 in 25 people will experience dysphagia in their lives.
Difficulty swallowing doesn�t always indicate a medical condition. It may be temporary and go away on its own."
dysphagia,"for dysphagia, what causes swallowing difficulty??","According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)
, there are 50 pairs of muscles and nerves used to help you swallow. In other words, there are lots of things that can go wrong and lead to problems swallowing. Some conditions related to difficulty swallowing include:
Acid reflux and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Acid reflux symptoms are caused when stomach contents flow up from the stomach back into the esophagus, causing symptoms like heartburn, stomach pain, and burping. Learn more about the causes, symptoms, and treatment of acid reflux and GERD.
Heartburn. Heartburn is a burning sensation in your chest that often occurs with a bitter taste in your throat or mouth. Find out how to recognize, treat, and prevent heartburn.
Epiglottitis. Epiglottitis is characterized by inflamed tissue in your epiglottis. It�s a potentially life threatening condition. Learn who gets it, why, and how it�s treated. This condition is considered a medical emergency. Urgent care may be required.
Goiter. Your thyroid is a gland found in your neck just below your Adam�s apple. A condition that increases the size of your thyroid is called a goiter. Read more about the causes and symptoms of goiter.
Esophagitis. Esophagitis is inflammation of the esophagus that can be caused by acid reflux or certain medications. Learn more about the types of esophagitis and their treatments.
Esophageal cancer. Esophageal cancer occurs when a malignant (cancerous) tumor forms in the lining of the esophagus, which can cause difficulty swallowing. Read more about esophageal cancer, its causes, diagnosis, and treatment.
Herpes esophagitis. Herpes esophagitis is caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). The infection can cause some chest pain and difficulty swallowing. Learn more about how herpes esophagitis is diagnosed and treated.
Recurrent herpes simplex labialis. Recurrent herpes simplex labialis, also known as oral or orolabial herpes, is an infection of the mouth area caused by the herpes simplex virus. Read about symptoms, treatment, and prevention of this infection.
Thyroid nodule. A thyroid nodule is a lump that can develop in your thyroid gland. It can be solid or filled with fluid. You can have a single nodule or a cluster of nodules. Learn what causes thyroid nodules and how they are treated.
Infectious mononucleosis. Infectious mononucleosis, or mono, refers to a group of symptoms usually caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Learn about the symptoms and treatments for infectious mononucleosis.
Zenker�s diverticulum. A rare instance in which a pouch-like structure forms between the pharynx and the esophagus, making it difficult to swallow. Learn more about the symptoms and causes of Zenker�s diverticulum.
Snake bites. A bite from a venomous snake should always be treated as a medical emergency. Even a bite from a harmless snake can lead to an allergic reaction or infection. Read more about what to do in the event of a snake bite.
Other medical conditions that may produce swallowing problems as a result of either the condition or its treatment include:

drooling
hoarse voice
feeling like something is lodged in your throat
regurgitation
unexpected weight loss
heartburn
coughing or choking when swallowing
pain when swallowing
difficulty chewing solid foods
recurrent pneumonia

avoid eating
skip meals
lose their appetite
Children who have difficulty swallowing when eating may:
refuse to eat certain foods
have food or liquid leaking from their mouths
regurgitate during meals
have trouble breathing when eating
lose weight without trying"
dysphagia,"for dysphagia, how is swallowing difficulty diagnosed??","Talk with a doctor about your symptoms and when they began. Your doctor will do a physical examination and look in your mouth to check for abnormalities or swelling.
More specialized tests may be needed to find the exact cause.
Barium X-ray
A barium X-ray is often used to check the inside of the esophagus for abnormalities or blockages. During this examination, you will swallow liquid or a pill containing a dye that shows up on an abdominal X-ray.
The doctor or technician will look at the X-ray image as you swallow the liquid or pill to see how the esophagus functions. This will help them identify any weaknesses or abnormalities.
Video fluoroscopy
A videofluoroscopic swallowing evaluation is a radiologic exam that uses a type of X-ray called fluoroscopy. This test is performed by a speech-language pathologist. It shows the oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal phases of the swallow.
During this examination, you�ll swallow a variety of consistencies, ranging from purees to solids and thin and thickened liquid. This process uses a radiopaque dye in the foods. This will show the ingestion of food and liquid into the trachea, or windpipe. Your medical team can use this information to diagnose muscle weakness and dysfunction."
dysphagia,"for dysphagia, functional endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (fees)?","This procedure assesses how well a person is able to swallow. This tool allows a doctor to test different food textures, fluid consistencies, and more. This will allow the doctor determine the severity of the swallowing issues and how to treat it.
Endoscopy
An endoscopy may be used to check all areas of your esophagus. During this examination, the doctor will insert a very thin flexible tube with a camera attachment down into your esophagus. This allows the doctor to see the esophagus in detail. It can also be done using a rigid tube, during which a doctor would use sedation. A doctor will often take biopsies during this procedure.
Manometry
Manometry is another invasive test that can be used to check the inside of your esophagus. More specifically, this test checks the pressure of the muscles in your throat when you swallow. The doctor will insert a tube into your esophagus to measure the pressure in your muscles when they contract."
dysphagia,"for dysphagia, treating swallowing difficulty?","Some swallowing difficulties can�t be prevented, and dysphagia treatment is necessary. A speech-language pathologist will perform a swallowing evaluation to diagnose your dysphagia. Once the evaluation is completed, the speech-language pathologist may recommend:
dietary changes
oropharyngeal swallowing exercises to strengthen muscles
alternative swallowing strategies
posture changes that you should follow while eating
However, if swallowing problems are persistent, they can result in malnutrition and dehydration, especially in the very young and in older adults.
Recurrent respiratory infections and aspiration pneumonia are also likely. All of these complications are serious and life threatening and must be treated definitively.
Various treatments may be prescribed depending on the medical condition causing swallowing difficulty:
Achalasia. If this is causing your swallowing problem, a procedure called esophageal dilation may be used to expand the esophagus. During this procedure, a small balloon is placed into the esophagus to widen it. The balloon is then removed.
Abnormal growths in the esophagus. Surgery may be necessary to remove them. Surgery may also be used to remove scar tissue.
Acid reflux or ulcers. You may be given prescription medication to treat these conditions and encouraged to follow a reflux diet.
Medications. If your swallowing difficulty is related to GERD, prescription oral medications can help reduce stomach acid. Corticosteroids might be recommended for eosinophilic esophagitis. For esophageal spasm, smooth muscle relaxants might help.
In severe cases or acute cases of swallowing difficulty, you may be admitted to the hospital. Treatments you may receive there include:
Feeding tube. You may receive enteral feeding, which is when you receive food through a tube that goes directly into the stomach and bypasses the esophagus.
Modified diets. A dietary change, such as a liquid diet, may be necessary to prevent dehydration and malnutrition until your swallowing difficulty improves."
dysphagia,"for dysphagia, home treatment?","You will likely coordinate your home treatment for dysphagia with your doctor, who may refer you to a speech therapist or occupational therapist. According to the NIDCD
, your home treatment for dysphagia may include:
Muscle exercises. You may be shown exercises to do at home to strengthen weak facial muscles or to improve coordination.
Eating in a specific position. Sometimes the position of your head makes it easier to swallow. For example, when you eat, you may need to turn your head to one side or look straight ahead.
Preparing food differently. You may need to prepare food in particular ways to make them safe for you to swallow. For example, if you can�t swallow thin liquids, you may need to add thickeners to your drinks.
Avoiding certain foods. You may need to avoid hot or cold foods or drinks.
For examples of exercises that doctors or speech therapists might prescribe to strengthen swallowing, see this selection of five exercises from the Napa Center.
Diet
There are many texture-modified foods for people with dysphagia. Because the consistencies of these foods vary so much, the International Dysphagia Diet Standardization Initiative (IDDSI) has created standardized worldwide terminology and definitions for texture-modified liquids and thickened foods.
The IDDSI standards have five levels or grades of thickening that range from grade 0, which is thin liquid, to grade 4, which is a pudding-like consistency.
The Nutrition Care Manual, the standard dietary resource for professionals established by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND), adopted the IDDSI standards effective October 2021.
Elaine Achilles, author of �The Dysphagia Cookbook,� gives helpful tips and recipes in her book on how to cook and present food for someone with swallowing difficulty.
She learned how to cook this way firsthand when her partner of 17 years was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which makes swallowing progressively difficult. Achilles gives tips like these in her book:
Downsize dish, cup, and utensil size. This will necessitate smaller bites, which is important for people with swallowing difficulty.
Always think about texture. Make it appealing. For example, put meringue on custard.
Emphasize taste and aroma. This will overpower unappealing soft textures and help make food appetizing.
Make the environment nice. A pretty table setting, flowers, and a simple attractive environment can do wonders for the appetite.
It�s important to note that dysphagia with a neurologic cause may present differently than dysphagia with other causes.
The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services summarizes which foods to eat and which to avoid if you have swallowing difficulty. Here are some of its recommendations for foods to avoid or use only when carefully prepared:
Peas and corn. These can roll to the back of the throat and create a choking hazard unless carefully prepared into a puree or porridge.
Meat. Meats can be tiring to chew and can get stuck in the throat or esophagus. Again, proper preparation is necessary.
Rice. It can get stuck in the throat and fall into the airway. It is usable if properly prepared.
Ice cream. Its consistency changes when it melts, and it may become too thin for some people with swallowing difficulty.
Bread. People tend to swallow it too soon, and balls of it become lodged in airways. Gelled bread can be used instead.
Peanut butter. It can be hard for people with swallowing difficulty to process peanut butter, and it may block the airways if aspirated (inhaled into the airway). It cannot be removed by a Heimlich maneuver.
Fibrous cooked vegetables. Some examples include cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and asparagus.
Fresh fruits. Fruits like apples and pears can be hard to chew. Stringy, high pulp fruits like pineapple or oranges are also best avoided unless properly prepared."
dysphagia,"for dysphagia, types of dysphagia?","Swallowing occurs in four phases:
oral preparatory
oral
pharyngeal
esophageal
Swallowing difficulty can be broken down into two categories: oropharyngeal (which includes the first three phases) and esophageal.
Oropharyngeal
Oropharyngeal dysphagia is often caused by disorders of the nerves and muscles in the throat. These disorders weaken the muscles, making it difficult for a person to swallow without choking or gagging.
The causes of oropharyngeal dysphagia are conditions that primarily affect the nervous system, such as:
multiple sclerosis (MS)
Parkinson�s disease
nerve damage from surgery or radiation therapy
post-polio syndrome
It may also be caused by an obstruction in the upper throat, pharynx, or pharyngeal pouches that collect food.
Esophageal
Esophageal dysphagia is the feeling that something is stuck in your throat. This condition is caused by:
spasms in the lower esophagus, such as diffuse spasms or the inability of the esophageal sphincter to relax
tightness in the lower esophagus due to an intermittent narrowing of the esophageal ring
narrowing of the esophagus from growths or scarring
foreign bodies lodged in the esophagus or throat
esophageal webs
diverticula
extrinsic compression
a swelling or narrowing of the esophagus from inflammation or GERD
scar tissue in the esophagus due to chronic inflammation or post-radiation treatment"
dysphagia,"for dysphagia, takeaway?","Dysphagia, the medical term for swallowing difficulty, can result from many different medical conditions or their treatments. It may be temporary or a lifelong condition.
People with dysphagia need to eat foods that have been carefully prepared so as not to present choking hazards. These can be fresh foods made into soft or pureed textures and cut into small bites, or special foods like thickened liquids or texture-modified foods.
Some people with dysphagia cannot take foods orally and must use a feeding tube. The good news is that many cases of dysphagia are temporary, and a wide variety of treatments are available."

What information do you have on Pneumocystis pneumonia? Could you provide information on Pneumocystis pneumonia?,"This type of pneumonia is rare but can be dangerous for those with weakened immune systems. Treatment and diagnosis processes have come a long way in the last few decades.
Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is an infection caused by a fungus called Pneumocystis jirovecii. PCP is a serious infection that most often develops in people with weakened immune systems. The infection is relatively rare in the general population.
The �C� in PCP comes from its previous name. There was a shift in understanding and knowledge about this infection in the 1980s when hospitals began seeing the number of people with it rise among those with HIV and AIDS. Before the 1980s, P. jirovecii was called P. carinii and was classed a protozoal infection. The �C� in the acronym PCP originally stood for carinii.
Although this is no longer correct, the acronym has stayed the same to avoid confusion. Keep reading to learn more about this rare form of pneumonia."
Pneumocystis pneumonia,"for Pneumocystis pneumonia, causes of pneumocystis pneumonia?","The fungus that causes PCP can live in the lungs of most people without causing symptoms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that up to 20% of adults
carry the fungus at any time. Most people�s bodies typically remove the fungus without issue after a few months.
But people with weakened immune systems can develop serious infections when they contract the fungus that causes PCP. This is most commonly seen in people who have HIV or AIDS. About 30% to 40%
of people with PCP have HIV or AIDS.
Other people who are at risk of PCP include people

There are no tracked statistics for PCP in the United States. Data from 2017 estimated that about 10,590 Americans
were hospitalized with PCP during that calendar year. But there aren�t overall statistics and data.
It�s known that before the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, PCP was extremely rare. During the height of the AIDS epidemic and before the development of today�s AIDS medications, around 75% of people with AIDS developed PCP.
These numbers have dropped in modern times, but PCP is still a concern for people with AIDS and other conditions that weaken their immune systems. PCP is also a concern in many countries around the world with developing healthcare systems.

Pneumocystis pneumonia,"for Pneumocystis pneumonia, symptoms of pneumocystis pneumonia?","Symptoms of PCP are similar to symptoms of other types of pneumonia. They can include:
difficulty breathing
cough
fever
chills
chest pain
fatigue
It�s a good idea to contact a healthcare professional if you�re experiencing any of these symptoms, especially if you�ve had them for more than a few days.
How to prevent Pneumocystis pneumonia
Some people who are at high risk of PCP, such as people with HIV or AIDS or people who�ve received organ or stem cell transplants, might be prescribed medication to help prevent PCP.
Typically, this involves a medication called co-trimoxazole (TMX/SMX). You and a healthcare professional can discuss if preventive medication is right for you. There�s no vaccine to prevent PCP.

Pneumocystis pneumonia,"for Pneumocystis pneumonia, diagnosis of pneumocystis pneumonia?","You�ll likely have a round of tests to confirm a diagnosis of PCP. This commonly includes:
Blood tests: Blood tests such as complete blood counts (CBCs) can help find your levels of white blood cells and can indicate an infection. Another blood test looks for a part of fungal cells called D-glucan.
Blood gas tests: You might have your arterial blood gas and venous blood gas taken to test the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood.
Sputum exam: A sputum exam tests mucus that you cough into a collection tube for PCP-causing fungus.
X-ray: An X-ray can take images of your chest and check for buildup in your lungs.
Bronchoscopy: A bronchoscopy is a test that uses a small and narrow tube called an endoscope that�s inserted into your airways to get a better look at inflammation and damage. It can provide sputum samples as well as biopsies.
Lung biopsy: During a lung biopsy, a piece of your lung tissue will be removed so that it can be tested in a lab."
Pneumocystis pneumonia,"for Pneumocystis pneumonia, treatments options for pneumocystis pneumonia?","PCP is a serious infection. People with PCP need medical treatment to resolve the infection. If PCP isn�t treated, it can be fatal.
Treatment for PCP most often involves co-trimoxazole medication given as oral medication or through an intravenous (IV) line. Typically, 3 weeks of treatment are required. Your healthcare team will be monitoring your progress closely, so be sure to ask them if you have any questions about your treatment for PCP.
You might also receive treatment to relieve your symptoms, such as medication to bring down fever, rehydration liquids, and pain-relieving medications.
Get involved
While we do have treatments for PCP, researchers are still looking to improve the process. If you�d like to get involved in the search for new and better treatments, check out ClinicalTrials.gov to see what studies are currently looking for participants.
Make sure to discuss any trials with a doctor or healthcare professional, especially if it will involve any changes to your current treatment regimen.

Pneumocystis pneumonia,"for Pneumocystis pneumonia, cost and coverage of pneumocystis pneumonia treatments?","The exact cost for PCP treatment will depend on your insurance plan and on factors such as the brand of co-trimoxazole you receive, if you need additional treatments for symptoms, and if you need hospitalization.
Your deductible, copayments, and the other details of your insurance plan will also make a difference in your final price.
PCP has an umbrella International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) diagnostic billing code of B59. All treatments will fall under this code when they�re billed to your insurance. You can use this code to search your insurance coverage information to see what�s listed.
Your plan might specify that only certain medications and treatments are covered for PCP. Make sure to check with them for the most up-to-date information."
Pneumocystis pneumonia,"for Pneumocystis pneumonia, outlook for pneumocystis pneumonia?","PCP can be fatal. Without treatment, PCP can lead to respiratory failure and to complications, such as a collapsed lung or fluid in your chest (pleural effusion).
Early treatment can help prevent these complications. Today, fewer people develop PCP than in the past thanks to better understanding and testing methods.
The introduction of medications for HIV and AIDS, especially antiretroviral therapy, has greatly reduced the number of people with PCP in the United States. But because the infection is so severe, the CDC still classifies PCP as a substantial public health concern."
Pneumocystis pneumonia,"for Pneumocystis pneumonia, takeaway?","PCP is a rare and serious fungal infection that primarily affects people with weakened immune systems.
This infection is most common in people with HIV and AIDS, but it can also occur in people who�ve had organ transplants and stem cell transplants and other people whose immune systems have been weakened due to conditions or medications.
Symptoms of PCP include fever, difficulty breathing, and fatigue. Medical treatment of PCP is important. Without treatment, PCP can be fatal. Treatment typically involves 3 weeks of co-trimoxazole medication orally or by an IV line."
alcohol use disorder,what is alcohol use disorder? Tell me about alcohol use disorder? What kind of disease is alcohol use disorder? Can you elaborate on alcohol use disorder? What can you tell me about alcohol use disorder? Could you describe what alcohol use disorder is? I�d like to know more about alcohol use disorder. Can you help? What information do you have on alcohol use disorder? Could you provide information on alcohol use disorder?,"Alcoholism, referred to as alcohol use disorder, occurs when someone drinks so much that their body eventually becomes dependent on or addicted to alcohol. There are different treatment plans available.
Alcoholism has been known by a variety of terms, including alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. Today, it�s referred to as alcohol use disorder.
People with alcohol use disorder will continue to drink even when drinking causes negative consequences, like losing a job or destroying relationships with people they love. They may know that their alcohol use negatively affects their lives, but it�s often not enough to make them stop drinking.
Some people may drink alcohol to the point that it causes problems, but they�re not physically dependent on alcohol. This used to be referred to as alcohol abuse."
alcohol use disorder,"for alcohol use disorder, what causes it??","The cause of alcohol use disorder is still unknown. Alcohol use disorder develops when you drink so much that chemical changes in the brain occur. These changes increase the pleasurable feelings you get when you drink alcohol. This makes you want to drink more often, even if it causes harm.
Eventually, the pleasurable feelings associated with alcohol use go away and the person with alcohol use disorder will engage in drinking to prevent withdrawal symptoms. These withdrawal symptoms can be quite unpleasant and even dangerous.
Alcohol use disorder typically develops gradually over time. It�s also known to run in families."
alcohol use disorder,"for alcohol use disorder, what are the risk factors??","Although the exact cause of alcohol use disorder is unknown, there are certain factors that may increase your risk for developing this disease.
Known risk factors include having:
more than 15 drinks per week if you�re male
more than 12 drinks per week if you�re female
more than 5 drinks per day at least once a week (binge drinking)
a parent with alcohol use disorder
a mental health problem, such as depression, anxiety, or schizophrenia
You may also be at a greater risk for alcohol use disorder if you:
are a young adult experiencing peer pressure
have low self-esteem
experience a high level of stress
live in a family or culture where alcohol use is common and accepted
have a close relative with alcohol use disorder"
alcohol use disorder,"for alcohol use disorder, what are the symptoms??","Symptoms of alcohol use disorder are based on the behaviors and physical outcomes that occur as a result of alcohol addiction.
People with alcohol use disorder may engage in the following behaviors:
drinking alone
drinking more to feel the effects of alcohol (having a high tolerance)
becoming violent or angry when asked about their drinking habits
not eating or eating poorly
neglecting personal hygiene
missing work or school because of drinking
being unable to control alcohol intake
making excuses to drink
continuing to drink even when legal, social, or economic problems develop
giving up important social, occupational, or recreational activities because of alcohol use
People with alcohol use disorder may also experience the following physical symptoms:
alcohol cravings
withdrawal symptoms when not drinking, including shaking, nausea, and vomiting
tremors (involuntary shaking) the morning after drinking
lapses in memory (blacking out) after a night of drinking
illnesses, such as alcoholic ketoacidosis (includes dehydration-type symptoms) or cirrhosis"
alcohol use disorder,"for alcohol use disorder, self-testing: do i misuse alcohol??","Sometimes it can be hard to draw the line between safe alcohol use and the misuse of alcohol. The Mayo Clinic suggests that you may misuse alcohol if you answer �yes� to some of the following questions:
Do you need to drink more in order to feel the effects of alcohol?
Do you feel guilty about drinking?
Do you become irritable or violent when you�re drinking?
Do you have problems at school or work because of drinking?
Do you think it might be better if you cut back on your drinking?
The National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence and AlcoholScreening.org offer more comprehensive self-tests. These tests can help you assess whether you misuse alcohol."
alcohol use disorder,"for alcohol use disorder, professional diagnosis?","Your doctor or healthcare provider can diagnose alcohol use disorder. They�ll do a physical exam and ask you questions about your drinking habits.
Your doctor may ask if you:
drive when you�re drunk
have missed work or have lost a job as a result of your drinking
need more alcohol to feel �drunk� when you drink
have experienced blackouts as a result of your drinking
have tried to cut back on your drinking but couldn�t
Your doctor may also use a questionnaire that assesses alcohol use disorder to help diagnose your condition.
Typically, a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder doesn�t require any other type of diagnostic test. There�s a chance your doctor may order blood work to check your liver function if you show signs or symptoms of liver disease.
Alcohol use disorder can cause serious and lasting damage to your liver. Your liver is responsible for removing toxins from your blood. When you drink too much, your liver has a harder time filtering the alcohol and other toxins from your bloodstream. This can lead to liver disease and other complications."
alcohol use disorder,"for alcohol use disorder, how is it treated??","Treatment for alcohol use disorder varies, but each method is meant to help you stop drinking altogether. This is called abstinence. Treatment may occur in stages and can include the following:
detoxification or withdrawal to rid your body of alcohol
rehabilitation to learn new coping skills and behaviors
counseling to address emotional problems that may cause you to drink
support groups, including 12-step programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)
medical treatment for health problems associated with alcohol use disorder
medications to help control addiction
There are a couple of different medications that may help with alcohol use disorder:
Naltrexone (ReVia) is used only after someone has detoxed from alcohol. This type of drug works by blocking certain receptors in the brain that are associated with the alcoholic �high.� This type of drug, in combination with counseling, may help decrease a person�s craving for alcohol.
Acamprosate is a medication that can help re-establish the brain�s original chemical state before alcohol dependence. This drug should also be combined with therapy.
Disulfiram (Antabuse) is a drug that causes physical discomfort (such as nausea, vomiting, and headaches) any time the person consumes alcohol.
You may need to seek treatment at an inpatient facility if your addiction to alcohol is severe. These facilities will provide you with 24-hour care as you withdraw from alcohol and recover from your addiction. Once you�re well enough to leave, you�ll need to continue to receive treatment on an outpatient basis."
alcohol use disorder,"for alcohol use disorder, what�s the outlook for a person with alcohol use disorder??","Recovering from alcohol use disorder is difficult. Your outlook will depend on your ability to stop drinking. Many people who seek treatment are able to overcome the addiction. A strong support system is helpful for making a complete recovery.
Your outlook will also depend on the health complications that have developed as a result of your drinking. Alcohol use disorder can severely damage your liver. It can also lead to other health complications, including:
bleeding in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract
damage to brain cells
cancer in the GI tract
dementia
depression
high blood pressure
pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
nerve damage
changes in mental status, including Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (a brain disease that causes symptoms such as confusion, vision changes, or memory loss)"
alcohol use disorder,"for alcohol use disorder, how can you prevent alcohol use disorder??","You can prevent alcohol use disorder by limiting your alcohol intake. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism
, women shouldn�t drink more than one drink per day, and men shouldn�t drink more than two drinks per day.
See your doctor if you begin to engage in behaviors that are signs of alcohol use disorder or if you think that you may have a problem with alcohol. You should also consider attending a local AA meeting or participating in a self-help program such as Women for Sobriety."

It tends to affect people with preexisting neurological conditions or injuries.
You may a neurological condition known as emotional lability if you have uncontrollable laughing or crying, often at inappropriate times. It tends to affect people with preexisting neurological conditions or injuries.
It has many other names, including:
While the symptoms of emotional lability seem psychological, they�re actually a result of changes to the part of your brain that�s responsible for emotional control."
emotional lability,"for emotional lability, what are the symptoms??","The main symptoms of emotional lability are uncontrollable outbursts of crying or laughing. These outbursts are usually an exaggerated or inappropriately intense emotional reaction. They can also be completely unrelated to your current emotional state. For example, you might start laughing uncontrollably when you�re upset.
Other symptoms of emotional lability include:
short emotional outbursts that don�t last for more than a few minutes
mixed emotional outbursts, such as laughing that turns into crying
lack of emotional symptoms between episodes
laughing or crying in situations that other people don�t find funny or sad
emotional responses that are over-the-top for the situation
emotional outbursts that are very different from your usual behavior"
emotional lability,"for emotional lability, emotional lability after a stroke?","Emotional lability often occurs after a stroke. According to the National Stroke Association
, more than half of stroke survivors have symptoms of emotional lability.
Strokes happen when a blood vessel in your brain bursts or something cuts of your brain�s blood supply. This causes brain cells to start dying within minutes, which can damage the parts of your brain responsible for memory, language, and emotion.
Researchers aren�t sure about the exact cause of emotional lability after a stroke. However, the most popular theory
suggests it�s related to damage to the connections between the brainstem and frontal lobes."
emotional lability,"for emotional lability, other causes of emotional lability?","In addition to strokes, neurological conditions and traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) can lead to emotional lability.
Common neurological conditions that can cause emotional lability include:
Alzheimer�s disease
dementia
multiple sclerosis (MS)
ALS (Lou Gehrig�s disease)
Types of TBIs that can cause emotional lability include:
blunt force head trauma
skull fracture
coup-countercoup injury
contusion
hematoma
laceration
penetrating injury
infection
brain swelling
oxygen deprivation"
emotional lability,"for emotional lability, how is it diagnosed??","Emotional lability is often misdiagnosed as depression or another mental health condition. To make getting a diagnosis easier, try to keep a journal of your symptoms, including when they occur and how long they last. If possible, note your general mood and emotional state between outbursts. If you don�t notice any emotional symptoms between episodes, it�s a good indicator that you likely have emotional lability, rather than a psychological condition.
Make sure to tell your doctor about any recent head injuries or underlying conditions. You might also find it helpful to bring along a loved one who�s observed your emotional outbursts.
While there�s no specific test for diagnosing emotional lability, your doctor will ask you a series of questions about your medical history and moods to confirm the diagnosis."
emotional lability,"for emotional lability, how is it treated??","More mild cases of emotional lability may not need treatment. However, if it causes significant stress, certain medications can help to reduce the severity and frequency of your outbursts. This can make the condition much more manageable and less destructive in social situations.
Medications often used to treat emotional lability include:
Dextromethorphan hydrobromide and quinidine sulfate (Nuedexta)
Nuedexta is currently the only medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to specifically treat emotional lability. Clinical studies
in people with neurological conditions found that it reduced the frequency of emotional outbursts by about half.
Antidepressants
Low doses of antidepressants may reduce the intensity of your emotional outbursts and make them occur less often.
Although antidepressants can alleviate the symptoms of emotional lability, they aren�t approved by the FDA to treat the condition. When a drug is used to treat a condition it hasn�t received FDA approval for, it�s known as off-label drug usage."
emotional lability,"for emotional lability, how can i find support??","Living with emotional lability can be frustrating, especially if it makes it hard for you to participate in social situations or those close to you don�t understand your condition.
Here are a few tips for coping with emotional lability:
Take frequent breaks from social situations to calm yourself.
Look for a local support group or online community to meet other people dealing with the condition that caused your emotional lability.
Practice slow breathing techniques and focus on your breath during episodes.
Figure out what triggers your episodes, such as stress or fatigue.
Distract yourself from rising emotions with a change of activity or position.
Distract yourself by counting objects in the room or counting your breath.
If you have an episode, try to move on with your day and avoid dwelling on it.
Prepare a short explanation to give to people who may be confused by your behavior, such as: �Since my stroke, I giggle sometimes. Just ignore it.�

emotional lability,"for emotional lability, what�s the outlook??","The long-term outlook for people with emotional lability depends on the underlying cause. If you have permanent brain damage from a stroke, you may continue to have outbursts for the rest of your life. However, over time, you may be able to identify things that trigger your outbursts or come up with ways to distract yourself when you feel one coming on.
If your episodes start to cause you a lot of stress, medication may also help. Work with your doctor to find treatment options that work best for you."

I�d like to know more about bedsore. Can you help? What information do you have on bedsore? Could you provide information on bedsore?,"A decubitus ulcer is also known as a pressure ulcer, pressure sore, or bedsore. It�s an open wound on your skin caused by a long period of constant pressure to a specific area of the body. Decreased blood flow to these areas leads to tissue damage and death.
Decubitus ulcers often occur on the skin covering bony areas. The most common places for a decubitus ulcer are your:
This condition is common among people who are older and people who have decreased mobility. Left untreated, infections can spread to the blood, heart, and bones and become life threatening.
But it�s important to know that bedsores can be treated. An individual�s outlook depends on several factors, including underlying medical conditions as well as the stage of the ulcer."
bedsore,"for bedsore, stages?","Decubitus ulcers occur in stages. There�s a staging process to help your healthcare professional diagnose and treat you.
Stage 1 and 2 ulcers usually do not require surgery, but stage 3 and 4 ulcers may.
Stage 1
The skin isn�t broken, but it�s discolored. The area may appear red if you have a light complexion. The discoloration may vary from blue to purple if you have a darker complexion.
For example, if you have a lighter complexion, a sore can turn red instead of turning lighter when you press on it. The sore will stay red for at least 30 minutes.
It may also:
feel warm to the touch
look swollen
be painful
itch
burn
Stage 2
A break in the skin reveals a shallow sore or cut that may leak pus. The sore may also look like a blister filled with fluid. It affects the first (epidermis) and possibly the second (dermis) layers of skin.
The ulcer hurts, and the surrounding skin may be discolored.
Stage 3
The ulcer is much deeper within the skin, affecting your fat layer. You should not be able to see bones or tendons.
The sore looks like a crater and may be foul smelling.
Stage 4
This ulcer is very deep and affects many tissue layers, possibly including the bone. There is a lot of dead tissue and pus. Infection is likely in this stage.
You may be able to see:
muscle
bones
tendons
joints
Unstageable
Sometimes, it�s not possible to measure the depth of a sore or the amount of tissue damage that has occurred. This makes it difficult to fully evaluate and stage an ulcer.
This may be due to the presence of a hard plaque called an eschar inside the sore. The sore may look:
tan
brown
black
Ulcers can also contain discolored debris known as slough that may appear:
yellow
tan
green
brown
Your doctor may need to remove the eschar or slough to determine the full extent of the ulcer. Further imaging or surgical evaluation of the area may be required."
bedsore,"for bedsore, symptoms?","Each stage of a decubitus ulcer has different symptoms. Depending on the stage, you may have any of the following:
skin discoloration
pain, itching, or burning in the affected area
open skin
skin that doesn�t lighten to the touch
skin that�s softer or firmer than the surrounding skin
necrosis, or dead tissue that appears black
The sore may also be infected. Symptoms of infection include:
redness or discoloration surrounding the sore
pus or green-colored drainage
a foul smell
fever"
bedsore,"for bedsore, causes?","Prolonged pressure is essentially the main cause of a decubitus ulcer. Lying on a certain part of your body for long periods causes your skin to break down. The areas around the hips, heels, and tailbone are especially vulnerable to these types of sores.
Other factors that increase the odds of experiencing a bedsore include:
poor circulation
excessive moisture
skin irritants like urine and feces
friction, such as when a person who is confined to bed has sheets dragged from under them"
bedsore,"for bedsore, risk factors?","You may be at greater risk of decubitus ulcers if you:
are confined to bed following surgery or illness
can�t move or change positions by yourself while lying in bed or sitting in a wheelchair
are over 70 years old, as older adults are more likely to have fragile skin and mobility difficulties
smoke
have obesity
don�t get enough nutrients in your diet, which may influence the condition of your skin
have urinary or bowel incontinence
have chronic conditions that can restrict your blood circulation or limit your mobility, such as:
diabetes
atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries)
heart failure
kidney failure
Parkinson�s disease
multiple sclerosis"
bedsore,"for bedsore, diagnosis?","Your healthcare professional may refer you to a wound care team of doctors, specialists, and nurses experienced in treating pressure sores. The team may evaluate your ulcer based on several factors, including:
the size and depth of your ulcer
the type of tissue directly affected by your ulcer, such as skin, muscle, or bone
the color of the skin affected by your ulcer
the amount of tissue death that occurs from your ulcer
the condition of your ulcer, such as presence of infection, strong odor, or bleeding
Your healthcare professional may take a biopsy, or sample of the fluids and tissue in your decubitus ulcer, and send it to a lab for testing."
bedsore,"for bedsore, treatment?","Your treatment will depend on the stage and condition of your ulcer. Repositioning frequently and keeping the site clean, dry, and free of irritants is important to promote healing.
Treatment may include:
treatment of any infection that is present, which may include:
antibiotic cream
oral antibiotics
intravenous (IV) antibiotics
local wound care, including specific cleaning and dressing recommendations
using special bandages that help remove dead tissue
medication to relieve or reduce any discomfort
debridement, which removes dead or infected tissue
repositioning frequently
reducing friction and moisture in the location
using special off-loading cushions to reduce pressure on the sore
surgery
Stage 3 and 4 ulcers are more likely to require surgical debridement and negative pressure wound therapy. Chronic deep ulcers may be difficult to treat.
Your treatment strategy depends on several factors. Your doctor will discuss the best options for your specific ulcer.

bedsore,"for bedsore, prevention?","Your doctor or a physical therapist can make recommendations to reduce the likelihood of experiencing bedsores. They may recommend:
changing positions in bed at least every 2 hours
if you use a wheelchair, aiming to:
sit upright
shift your sitting position every 15 minutes
use a cushion that redistributes your weight
regularly checking your skin for signs of pressure sores, if you�re hospitalized or otherwise immobilized
using pillows or a pressure-reducing mattress to prevent new sores from forming in vulnerable areas
wearing clothing that isn�t too tight or loose or that bunches up under you
wearing special padding on pressure points including elbows and heels
quitting smoking, if you currently smoke
dietary modifications for adequate nutrition and possibly working with a registered dietitian
staying hydrated
exercising as much as possible, such as taking short walks a couple of times per day or sitting up and stretching"
bedsore,"for bedsore, outlook?","Your healing process depends on the stage of your ulcer. The sooner it�s diagnosed, the sooner you can begin treatment and recovery.
Early treatment reduces the likelihood of experiencing possibly life threatening complications, including infection. Later stages often require more aggressive treatments and longer recovery times.
Your healthcare professional may suggest that you change your diet and exercise routine to reduce the risk of recurrence. This may involve eating a balanced diet and getting regular exercise as best you can."
