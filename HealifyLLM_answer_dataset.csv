diabetes,diabetes definition,"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease that causes high blood sugar. Your body either doesn�t make enough insulin or can�t effectively use the insulin it makes.
The hormone insulin moves sugar from the blood into your cells to be stored or used for energy. If this malfunctions, you may have diabetes.
Untreated high blood sugar from diabetes can damage your nerves, eyes, kidneys, and other organs. But educating yourself about diabetes and taking steps to prevent or manage it can help you protect your health."
diabetes,diabetes symptoms,"Diabetes symptoms are caused by rising blood sugar.
General symptoms
The symptoms of type 1, type 2, and type 1.5 (LADA) are the same, but they occur in a shorter period than types 2 and 1.5. In type 2, the onset tends to be slower. Tingling nerves and slow-healing sores are more common in type 2.
Left untreated, type 1, in particular, can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. This is when there is a dangerous level of ketones in the body. It�s less common in other types of diabetes, but still possible.
The general symptoms of diabetes include:
increased hunger
increased thirst
weight loss
frequent urination
blurry vision
extreme fatigue
sores that don�t heal
Symptoms in men
In addition to the general symptoms of diabetes, men with diabetes may have:
a decreased sex drive
erectile dysfunction
poor muscle strength
Symptoms in women
Women with diabetes can have symptoms such as:
vaginal dryness
urinary tract infections
yeast infections
dry, itchy skin
Gestational diabetes
Most people who develop gestational diabetes don�t have any symptoms. Healthcare professionals often detect the condition during a routine blood sugar test or oral glucose tolerance test, which is usually performed between the 24th and 28th weeks of pregnancy.
In rare cases, a person with gestational diabetes will also experience increased thirst or urination.
The bottom line
Diabetes symptoms can be so mild that they�re hard to spot at first. Learn which signs should prompt a trip to the doctor."
diabetes,diabetes causes,"Different causes are associated with each type of diabetes.
Type 1 diabetes
Doctors don�t know exactly what causes type 1 diabetes. For some reason, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.
Genes may play a role in some people. It�s also possible that a virus sets off an immune system attack.
Type 2 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes stems from a combination of genetics and lifestyle factors. Having overweight or obesity increases your risk, too. Carrying extra weight, especially in your belly, makes your cells more resistant to the effects of insulin on your blood sugar.
This condition runs in families. Family members share genes that make them more likely to get type 2 diabetes and to be overweight.
Type 1.5 diabetes
Type 1.5 is an autoimmune condition that occurs when the pancreas is attacked by your own antibodies. as in type 1. It may be genetic, but more research is needed.
Gestational diabetes
Gestational diabetes occurs as the result of hormonal changes during pregnancy. The placenta produces hormones that make a pregnant person�s cells less sensitive to the effects of insulin. This can cause high blood sugar during pregnancy.
People who are overweight when they get pregnant or who gain too much weight during pregnancy are more likely to get gestational diabetes.
The bottom line
Both genes and environmental factors play a role in triggering diabetes.
Get more information on the causes of diabetes."
diabetes,diabetes risks,"Certain factors increase your risk for diabetes.
Type 1 diabetes
You�re more likely to get type 1 diabetes if you�re a child or teenager, you have a parent or sibling with the condition, or you carry certain genes that are linked to the disease.
Type 2 diabetes
Your risk for type 2 diabetes increases if you:
are overweight
are age 45 or older
have a parent or sibling with the condition
aren�t physically active
have had gestational diabetes
have prediabetes
have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or high triglycerides
Type 2 diabetes also disproportionately affects certain racial and ethnic populations.
Adults who have African American, Hispanic or Latino American, or Asian American ancestry are more likely to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes than white adults, according to 2016 research. They�re also more likely to experience decreased quality of care and increased barriers to self-management.
Type 1.5 diabetes
Type 1.5 diabetes is found in adults over 30 and is often mistaken for type 2, but people with this condition are not necessarily overweight, and oral medications and lifestyle changes have no effect.
Gestational diabetes
Your risk for gestational diabetes increases if you:
are overweight
are over age 25
had gestational diabetes during a past pregnancy
have given birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds
have a family history of type 2 diabetes
have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
The bottom line
Your family history, environment, and preexisting medical conditions can all affect your odds of developing diabetes.
Find out which risks you can control and which ones you can�t."
diabetes,diabetes complications,"High blood sugar damages organs and tissues throughout your body. The higher your blood sugar is and the longer you live with it, the greater your risk for complications.
Complications associated with diabetes include:
heart disease, heart attack, and stroke
neuropathy
nephropathy
retinopathy and vision loss
hearing loss
foot damage, such as infections and sores that don�t heal
skin conditions, such as bacterial and fungal infections
depression
dementia
Gestational diabetes
Unmanaged gestational diabetes can lead to problems that affect both the mother and baby. Complications affecting the baby can include:
premature birth
higher-than-typical weight at birth
increased risk for type 2 diabetes later in life
low blood sugar
jaundice
stillbirth
A pregnant person with gestational diabetes can develop complications such as high blood pressure (preeclampsia) or type 2 diabetes. You may also require cesarean delivery, commonly referred to as a C-section.
The risk of gestational diabetes in future pregnancies also increases.
The bottom line
Diabetes can lead to serious medical complications, but you can manage the condition with medications and lifestyle changes.
Avoid the most common diabetes complications with these helpful tips.

diabetes,diabetes treatment,"Doctors treat diabetes with a few different medications. Some are taken by mouth, while others are available as injections.
Type 1 and 1.5 diabetes
Insulin is the main treatment for type 1 and 1.5 diabetes. It replaces the hormone your body isn�t able to produce.
Various types of insulin are commonly used by people with type 1 and 1.5 diabetes. They differ in how quickly they start to work and how long their effects last:
Rapid-acting insulin: starts to work within 15 minutes and its effects last for 2 to 4 hours
Short-acting insulin: starts to work within 30 minutes and lasts 3 to 6 hours
Intermediate-acting insulin: starts to work within 2 to 4 hours and lasts 12 to 18 hours
Long-acting insulin: starts to work 2 hours after injection and lasts up to 24 hours
Ultra-long acting insulin: starts to work 6 hours after injection and lasts 36 hours or more
Premixed insulin: starts working within 15 to 30 minutes (depending on whether a rapid-acting or short-acting insulin is part of the mix) and lasts 10 to 16 hours
Type 2 diabetes
Diet and exercise can help some people manage type 2 diabetes. If lifestyle changes aren�t enough to lower your blood sugar, you�ll need to take medication.
These drugs lower your blood sugar in a variety of ways:
Drug How it works Examples
alpha-glucosidase inhibitors slow your body�s breakdown of sugars and starchy foods acarbose (Precose) and miglitol
biguanides reduce the amount of glucose your liver makes metformin (Glucophage, Riomet)
DPP-4 inhibitors improve your blood sugar without making it drop too low alogliptin (Nesina), linagliptin (Tradjenta), saxagliptin (Onglyza), and sitagliptin (Januvia)
glucagon-like peptides stimulate your pancreas to produce more insulin; slow stomach emptying semaglutide (Ozempic), dulaglutide (Trulicity), exenatide (Byetta), and liraglutide (Victoza)
meglitinides stimulate your pancreas to release more insulin nateglinide and repaglinide
SGLT2 inhibitors release more glucose into the urine canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), and empagliflozin (Jardiance)
sulfonylureas stimulate your pancreas to release more insulin glyburide (Glynase), glipizide (Glucotrol), and glimepiride (Amaryl)
thiazolidinediones help insulin work better pioglitazone (Actos) and rosiglitazone
You may need to take more than one of these medications. Some people with type 2 diabetes also take insulin.
Gestational diabetes
If you receive a diagnosis of gestational diabetes, you�ll need to monitor your blood sugar level several times per day during pregnancy. If it�s high, dietary changes and exercise may be enough to bring it down.
Research has found that about 15% to 30%
of women who develop gestational diabetes will need insulin to lower their blood sugar. Insulin is safe for the developing baby.
The bottom line
The treatment regimen your doctor recommends will depend on the type of diabetes you have and its cause.
Check out this list of the various medications that are available to treat diabetes."
diabetes,diabetes diagnosis,"Anyone who has symptoms of diabetes or is at risk for the condition should be tested. People are routinely tested for gestational diabetes during their second trimester or third trimester of pregnancy.
Doctors use these blood tests to diagnose prediabetes and diabetes:
The fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test measures your blood sugar after you�ve fasted for 8 hours.
The A1C test provides a snapshot of your blood sugar levels over the previous 3 months.
A 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test is also used. This checks the BG 2 hours after ingesting a sugary drink containing 75 grams of carbs.
How to diagnose gestational diabetes
To diagnose gestational diabetes, your doctor will test your blood sugar levels between the 24th week and 28th week of pregnancy. There are two types of tests:
Glucose challenge test: During a glucose challenge test, your blood sugar is checked an hour after you drink a sugary liquid. If your results are standard, no more testing is done. If blood sugar levels are high, you�ll need to undergo a glucose tolerance test.
Glucose tolerance test: During a glucose tolerance test, your blood sugar is checked after you fast overnight. Then you�re given a sugary drink and your blood sugar is re-tested after 1 hour and again after 2 hours. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed if any of these three readings come back noting high blood sugar.
The earlier you are diagnosed with diabetes, the sooner you can start treatment. Find out whether you should get tested, and get more information on tests your doctor might perform.
If you don�t already have a primary care specialist, you can browse doctors in your area through the Healthline FindCare tool."
diabetes,diabetes prevention,"Type 1 and type 1.5 diabetes are not preventable because they are caused by an issue with the immune system. Some causes of type 2 diabetes, such as your genes or age, aren�t under your control either.
Yet many other diabetes risk factors are manageable. Most diabetes prevention strategies involve making simple adjustments to your diet and fitness routine.
If you�ve received a diagnosis of prediabetes, here are a few things you can do to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes:
Get at least 150 minutes per week of aerobic exercises like walking or cycling.
Cut saturated and trans fats, along with refined carbohydrates, out of your diet.
Eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
Eat smaller portions.
Try to lose 5% to 7%
of your body weight if you have overweight or obesity.
These aren�t the only ways to prevent diabetes. Discover more strategies that may help you avoid this chronic health condition."
depression mental or depressive disorder,depression mental or depressive disorder definition,"Major depressive disorder (MDD), or clinical depression, is a common mood disorder that can affect anyone. Its most prevalent symptom includes persistent sadness or irritability.
Sadness is a natural part of the human experience. People may feel sad or depressed when a loved one passes away or when they�re going through a life challenge, such as a divorce or serious illness.
These feelings are usually short-lived. When someone experiences persistent and intense feelings of sadness for extended periods, then they may have a mood disorder such as major depressive disorder (MDD)."
depression mental or depressive disorder,depression mental or depressive disorder symptoms,"A doctor or a mental health professional can diagnose MDD based on your symptoms, feelings, and behaviors.
Typically, you�ll be asked specific questions or given a questionnaire so health professionals can better determine whether you have MDD or another condition.
To be diagnosed with MDD, you need to meet the symptom criteria listed in the �Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5).� This manual helps medical professionals diagnose mental health conditions.
According to its criteria:
You must experience a change in your previous functioning.
Symptoms must occur for a period of 2 or more weeks.
At least one symptom is either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure.
You must also experience five or more of the following symptoms in the 2-week period:
You feel sad or irritable most of the day, nearly every day.
You�re less interested in most activities you once enjoyed.
You suddenly lose or gain weight or have a change in appetite.
You have trouble falling asleep or want to sleep more than usual.
You experience feelings of restlessness.
You feel unusually tired and have a lack of energy.
You feel worthless or guilty, often about things that wouldn�t usually make you feel that way.
You have difficulty concentrating, thinking, or making decisions.
You think about harming yourself or suicide.
Symptoms in different age groups
Symptoms in teens
Symptoms parents should be aware of in their teens include the following:
onset or increased use of substances (i.e., alcohol, smoking)
poorer academic performance
problems with peers
increased social withdrawal/isolation
Symptoms in older adults
Depression symptoms in older adults are similar to other age groups. It�s often the cause of physical pain in older adults that�s not explained by other medical conditions.
Depression is common
in people with Alzheimer�s and related dementias. It�s sometimes called geriatric depression.
Older adults with one chronic health condition are 80%
more at risk of developing depression than the average person, especially if their function becomes limited."
depression mental or depressive disorder,depression mental or depressive disorder causes,"The exact cause of MDD isn�t known. However, several factors can increase
your risk of developing the condition.
A combination
of genes and stress can affect brain chemistry and lower your ability to maintain mood stability.
Changes in the balance of hormones might also contribute to the development of MDD.
MDD may also be triggered by:
alcohol
or drug use
certain medical conditions, such as cancer or hypothyroidism
particular types of medications, including steroids
abuse during childhood"
coronary arteriosclerosis or coronary heart disease,coronary arteriosclerosis or coronary heart disease definition,"Coronary artery disease is the most common form of heart disease. It happens when something, like plaque buildup, reduces blood flow to the heart. It can increase your risk of heart attack.
Coronary artery disease (CAD) causes impaired blood flow in the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Also called coronary heart disease (CHD), CAD is the most common form of heart disease and affects approximately 16.5 million
Americans over the age of 20.
It�s also the leading ca
use of death
for both men and women in the United States. It�s estimated that every 36 seconds
, someone in the United States has a heart attack.
A heart attack can come from uncontrolled CAD."
coronary arteriosclerosis or coronary heart disease,coronary arteriosclerosis or coronary heart disease symptoms,"When your heart doesn�t get enough arterial blood, you may experience a variety of symptoms. Angina (chest discomfort) is the most common symptom of CAD. Some people describe this discomfort as:
chest pain
heaviness
tightness
burning
squeezing
These symptoms can also be mistaken for heartburn or indigestion.
Other symptoms of CAD include:
pain in the arms or shoulders
shortness of breath
sweating
dizziness
You may experience more symptoms when your blood flow is more restricted. If a blockage cuts off blood flow completely or almost completely, your heart muscle will start to die if not restored. This is a heart attack.
Don�t ignore any of these symptoms, especially if they are excruciating or last longer than five minutes. Immediate medical treatment is necessary.
Symptoms of CAD for women
Women may also experience the above symptoms, but they�re also more likely to have:
nausea
vomiting
back pain
jaw pain
shortness of breath without feeling chest pain
Men have a higher risk
of developing heart disease than women, however.
Due to decreased blood flow, your heart may also:
become weak
develop abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmia) or rates
fail to pump as much blood as your body needs
Your doctor will detect these heart abnormalities during diagnosis."
coronary arteriosclerosis or coronary heart disease,coronary arteriosclerosis or coronary heart disease causes,"The most common cause of CAD is a vascular injury with cholesterol plaque buildup in the arteries, known as atherosclerosis. Reduced blood flow occurs when one or more of these arteries becomes partially or completely blocked.
Other rare causes of damage or blockage to a coronary artery also limit blood flow to the heart."
coronary arteriosclerosis or coronary heart disease,coronary arteriosclerosis or coronary heart disease risks,"Understanding the risk factors for CAD can help with your plan to prevent or decrease the likelihood of developing the disease.
Risk factors include:
high blood pressure
high blood cholesterol levels
tobacco smoking
insulin resistance/hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus
obesity
inactivity
unhealthy eating habits
obstructive sleep apnea
emotional stress
excessive alcohol consumption
history of preeclampsia during pregnancy
The risk for CAD also increases with age. Based on age alone as a risk factor, men have a greater risk for the disease beginning at age 45 and women have a greater risk beginning at age 55. The risk for coronary artery disease is also higher if you have a family history of the disease."
coronary arteriosclerosis or coronary heart disease,coronary arteriosclerosis or coronary heart disease diagnosis,"Diagnosing CAD requires a review of your medical history, a physical examination, and other medical testing. These tests include:
Electrocardiogram: This test monitors electrical signals that travel through your heart. It may help your doctor determine whether you�ve had a heart attack.
Echocardiogram: This imaging test uses ultrasound waves to create a picture of your heart. The results of this test reveal whether certain things in your heart are functioning properly.
Stress test: This particular test measures the stress on your heart during physical activity and while at rest. The test monitors your heart�s electrical activity while you walk on a treadmill or ride a stationary bike. Nuclear imaging or echocardiographic imaging may also be performed for a portion of this test. For those unable to perform physical exercise, certain medications can be used instead for stress testing.
Cardiac catheterization (left heart catheterization): During this procedure, your doctor injects a special dye into your coronary arteries through a catheter inserted through an artery in your groin or wrist. The dye helps enhance the radiographic image of your coronary arteries to identify any blockages.
Heart CT scan: Your doctor may use this imaging test to check for calcium deposits in your arteries."
coronary arteriosclerosis or coronary heart disease,coronary arteriosclerosis or coronary heart disease treatment,"It�s important to reduce or control your risk factors and seek treatment to lower the chance of a heart attack or stroke if you�re diagnosed with CAD.
Treatment also depends on your current health condition, risk factors, and overall wellbeing. For example, your doctor may prescribe medication therapy to treat high cholesterol or high blood pressure, or you may receive medication to control blood sugar if you have diabetes.
Medications are the most common treatment for CAD. Learn more here.
Lifestyle changes can also reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke. For example:
quit smoking tobacco
reduce or stop your consumption of alcohol
exercise regularly
lose weight to a healthy level
eat a healthy diet (low in saturated fat, sodium, and added sugar)
If your condition doesn�t improve with lifestyle changes and medication, your doctor may recommend a procedure to increase blood flow to your heart. These procedures may be:
balloon angioplasty: to widen blocked arteries and smoosh down the plaque buildup, usually performed with insertion of a stent to help keep the lumen open after the procedure
coronary artery bypass graft surgery: to restore blood flow to the heart in open chest surgery
enhanced external counterpulsation: to stimulate the formation of new small blood vessels to naturally bypass clogged arteries in a noninvasive procedure"
pneumonia,pneumonia definition,"Pneumonia is an infection caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. It leads to inflammation in the air sacs of one or both lungs. These sacs, called alveoli, fill with fluid or pus, making it difficult to breathe.
Both viral and bacterial pneumonia is contagious. This means they can spread from person to person through inhalation of airborne droplets from a sneeze or cough.
You can also get these types of pneumonia by coming into contact with surfaces or objects that are contaminated with pneumonia-causing bacteria or viruses.
You can contract fungal pneumonia from the environment. It does not spread from person to person.
Pneumonia is further classified according to where or how it was acquired:
Walking pneumonia is a milder case of pneumonia. People with walking pneumonia may not even know they have pneumonia. Their symptoms may feel more like a mild respiratory infection than pneumonia. However, walking pneumonia may require a longer recovery period.
The symptoms of walking pneumonia can include things like:
Viruses and bacteria, like Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae, often cause pneumonia. However, in walking pneumonia, the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae most commonly causes the condition.
Pneumonia may be classified based off the area of the lungs it�s affecting:
Bronchopneumonia can affect areas throughout both of your lungs. It�s often localized close to or around your bronchi. These are the tubes that lead from your windpipe to your lungs.
Lobar pneumonia affects one or more lobes of your lungs. Each lung is made of lobes, which are defined sections of the lung.
Lobar pneumonia can be further divided into four stages based off how it�s progressed:"
pneumonia,pneumonia symptoms,"Pneumonia symptoms can be mild to life threatening. They can include:
coughing that may produce phlegm (mucus)
fever
sweating or chills
shortness of breath that happens while doing normal activities, or even while resting
chest pain that�s worse when you breathe or cough
feelings of tiredness or fatigue
loss of appetite
nausea or vomiting
headaches
Other symptoms can vary according to your age and general health:
Infants may appear to have no symptoms, but sometimes they may vomit, lack energy, or have trouble drinking or eating.
Children under 5 years old may have fast breathing or wheezing.
Older adults may have milder symptoms. They can also experience confusion or a lower-than-normal body temperature."
pneumonia,pneumonia causes,"Pneumonia happens when germs get into your lungs and cause an infection. The immune system�s reaction to clear the infection results in inflammation of the lung�s air sacs (alveoli). This inflammation can eventually cause the air sacs to fill up with pus and liquids, causing pneumonia symptoms.
Several types of infectious agents can cause pneumonia, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
Bacterial pneumonia
The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other causes include:
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
Haemophilus influenzae
Legionella pneumophila
Viral pneumonia
Respiratory viruses are often the cause of pneumonia. Examples of viral infections that can cause pneumonia include:
influenza (flu)
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
rhinoviruses (common cold)
human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection
human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infection
measles
chickenpox (varicella-zoster virus)
adenovirus infection
coronavirus infection
SARS-CoV-2 infection (the virus that causes COVID-19)
Although the symptoms of viral and bacterial pneumonia are very similar, viral pneumonia is usually milder. It can improve in 1 to 3 weeks without treatment.
According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
, people with viral pneumonia are at risk of developing bacterial pneumonia.
Fungal pneumonia
Fungi from soil or bird droppings can cause pneumonia. They most often cause pneumonia in people with weakened immune systems. Examples of fungi that can cause pneumonia include:
Pneumocystis jirovecii
Cryptococcus species
Histoplasmosis species
Risk factors
Anyone can get pneumonia, but certain groups do have a higher risk. These groups include:
infants from birth to 2 years old
people ages 65 and older
people with weakened immune systems due to:
pregnancy
HIV
the use of certain medications, such as steroids or certain cancer drugs
people with certain chronic medical conditions, such as:
asthma
cystic fibrosis
diabetes
COPD
heart failure
sickle cell disease
liver disease
kidney disease
people who�ve been recently or are currently hospitalized, particularly if they were or are on a ventilator
people who�ve had a brain disorder, which can affect the ability to swallow or cough, such as:
stroke
head injury
dementia
Parkinson�s disease
people who�ve been regularly exposed to lung irritants, such as air pollution and toxic fumes, especially on the job
people who live in a crowded living environment, such as a prison or nursing home
people who smoke, which makes it more difficult for the body to get rid of mucus in the airways
people who use drugs or drink heavy amounts of alcohol, which weakens the immune system and increases the odds of inhaling saliva or vomit into the lungs due to sedation"
pneumonia,pneumonia diagnosis,"Your doctor will start by taking your medical history. They�ll ask you questions about when your symptoms first appeared and your health in general.
They�ll then give you a physical exam. This will include listening to your lungs with a stethoscope for any abnormal sounds, such as crackling.
Depending on the severity of your symptoms and your risk of complications, your doctor may also order one or more of these tests:
Chest X-ray
An X-ray helps your doctor look for signs of inflammation in your chest. If inflammation is present, the X-ray can also inform your doctor about its location and extent.
Blood culture
This test uses a blood sample to confirm an infection. Culturing can also help identify what may be causing your condition.
Sputum culture
During a sputum culture, a sample of mucus is collected after you�ve coughed deeply. It�s then sent to a lab to be analyzed to identify the cause of the infection.
Pulse oximetry
A pulse oximetry measures the amount of oxygen in your blood. A sensor placed on one of your fingers can indicate whether your lungs are moving enough oxygen through your bloodstream.
CT scan
CT scans provide a clearer and more detailed picture of your lungs.
Fluid sample
If your doctor suspects there�s fluid in the pleural space of your chest, they may take a fluid sample using a needle placed between your ribs. This test can help identify the cause of your infection.
Bronchoscopy
A bronchoscopy looks into the airways in your lungs. It does this using a camera on the end of a flexible tube that�s gently guided down your throat and into your lungs.
Your doctor may do this test if your initial symptoms are severe, or if you�re hospitalized and not responding well to antibiotics.
If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here."
pneumonia,pneumonia treatment,"Your treatment will depend on the type of pneumonia you have, how severe it is, and your general health.
Prescription medications
Your doctor may prescribe a medication to help treat your pneumonia. What you�re prescribed will depend on the specific cause of your pneumonia.
Oral antibiotics can treat most cases of bacterial pneumonia. Always take your entire course of antibiotics, even if you begin to feel better. Not doing so can prevent the infection from clearing, and it may be harder to treat in the future.
Antibiotic medications don�t work on viruses. In some cases, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral. However, many cases of viral pneumonia clear on their own with at-home care.
Antifungal medications are used to treat fungal pneumonia. You may have to take this medication for several weeks to clear the infection.
OTC medications
Your doctor may also recommend over-the-counter (OTC) medications to relieve your pain and fever, as needed. These may include:
aspirin
ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)
acetaminophen (Tylenol)
Your doctor may also recommend cough medicine to calm your cough so you can rest. Keep in mind coughing helps remove fluid from your lungs, so you don�t want to eliminate it entirely.
Home remedies
Although home remedies don�t actually treat pneumonia, there are some things you can do to help ease symptoms.
Coughing is one of the most common symptoms of pneumonia. Natural ways to relieve a cough include gargling salt water or drinking peppermint tea.
Cool compresses can work to relieve a fever. Drinking warm water or having a nice warm bowl of soup can help with chills. Here are more home remedies to try.
You can help your recovery and prevent a recurrence by getting a lot of rest and drinking plenty of fluids.
Although home remedies can help ease symptoms, it�s important to stick to your treatment plan. Take any prescribed medications as directed.
Hospitalization
If your symptoms are very severe or you have other health problems, you may need to be hospitalized. At the hospital, doctors can keep track of your heart rate, temperature, and breathing. Hospital treatment may include:
antibiotics injected into a vein
respiratory therapy, which involves delivering specific medications directly into the lungs, or teaching you to perform breathing exercises to maximize your oxygenation
oxygen therapy to maintain oxygen levels in your bloodstream (received through a nasal tube, face mask, or ventilator, depending on severity)"
pneumonia,pneumonia complications,"Pneumonia may cause complications, especially in people with weakened immune systems or chronic conditions, such as diabetes.
Complications may include:
Worsened chronic conditions. If you have certain preexisting health conditions, pneumonia could make them worse. These conditions include congestive heart failure and emphysema. For certain people, pneumonia increases their risk of having a heart attack.
Bacteremia. Bacteria from the pneumonia infection may spread to your bloodstream. This can lead to dangerously low blood pressure, septic shock, and, in some cases, organ failure.
Lung abscesses. These are cavities in the lungs that contain pus. Antibiotics can treat them. Sometimes they may require drainage or surgery to remove the pus.
Impaired breathing. You may have trouble getting enough oxygen when you breathe. You may need to use a ventilator.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome. This is a severe form of respiratory failure. It�s a medical emergency.
Pleural effusion. If your pneumonia isn�t treated, you may develop fluid around your lungs in your pleura, called pleural effusion. The pleura are thin membranes that line the outside of your lungs and the inside of your rib cage. The fluid may become infected and need to be drained.
Kidney, heart, and liver damage. These organs may be damaged if they don�t receive enough oxygen, or if there�s an overreaction of the immune system to the infection.
Death. In some cases, pneumonia can be fatal. According to the CDC, nearly 44,000 people
in the United States died from pneumonia in 2019."
pneumonia,pneumonia prevention,"In many cases, pneumonia can be prevented.
Vaccination
The first line of defense against pneumonia is to get vaccinated. There are several vaccines that can help prevent pneumonia.
Prevnar 13 and Pneumovax 23
These two pneumonia vaccines help protect against pneumonia and meningitis caused by pneumococcal bacteria. Your doctor can tell you which one might be better for you.
Prevnar 13 is effective against 13 types of pneumococcal bacteria. The CDC
recommends this vaccine for:
children under age 2
people between ages 2 and 64 with chronic conditions that increase their risk of pneumonia
adults ages 65 and older, on the recommendation of their doctor
Pneumovax 23 is effective against 23 types of pneumococcal bacteria. The CDC
recommends it for:
adults ages 65 and older
adults ages 19 to 64 who smoke
people between ages 2 and 64 with chronic conditions that increase their risk of pneumonia
Flu vaccine
Pneumonia can often be a complication of the flu, so be sure to also get an annual flu shot. The CDC
recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older get vaccinated, particularly those who may be at risk of flu complications.
Hib vaccine
This vaccine protects against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), a type of bacterium that can cause pneumonia and meningitis. The CDC
recommends this vaccine for:
all children under 5 years old
unvaccinated older children or adults who have certain health conditions
people who�ve gotten a bone marrow transplant
According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
, pneumonia vaccines won�t prevent all cases of the condition.
But if you�re vaccinated, you�re likely to have a milder and shorter illness as well as a lower risk of complications.
Other prevention tips
In addition to vaccination, there are other things you can do to avoid pneumonia:
If you smoke, try to quit. Smoking makes you more susceptible to respiratory infections, especially pneumonia.
Regularly wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
Cover your coughs and sneezes. Promptly dispose used tissues.
Maintain a healthy lifestyle to strengthen your immune system. Get enough rest, eat a balanced diet, and get regular exercise.
Together with vaccination and additional prevention steps, you can help reduce your risk of getting pneumonia. Here are even more prevention tips."
asthma,asthma definition,"Asthma occurs because of inflammation and mucus in the lining of the airways. During an attack, this commonly causes a wheezing or whistling sound when you breathe but can cause other symptoms."
asthma,asthma symptoms,"The most common symptom of asthma is wheezing. This is a squealing or whistling sound that occurs when you breathe.
Other asthma symptoms may include:
coughing, especially at night, when laughing, or during exercise
tightness in the chest
shortness of breath
difficulty talking
anxiousness or panic
fatigue
chest pain
rapid breathing
frequent infections
trouble sleeping
The type of asthma that you have can determine which symptoms you experience.
Some people experience symptoms consistently throughout the day. Others may find that certain activities can make symptoms worse.
Not everyone with asthma will experience these particular symptoms. If you think the symptoms you�re experiencing could be a sign of a condition such as asthma, make an appointment to see your doctor.
Also, keep in mind that even if your asthma is well-managed, you may still occasionally experience a flare-up of symptoms. Flare-ups often improve with the use of quick-acting treatments, like an inhaler, but may require medical attention in severe cases.
Signs of an asthma flare-up may include:
coughing
wheezing
throat clearing
difficulty sleeping
chest pain or tightness
fatigue
If your symptoms worsen or don�t improve with the use of an inhaler, you should seek immediate medical treatment.
You should also seek treatment if you experience symptoms of an asthma emergency, including:
severe breathing difficulty
gasping for air
confusion
pale lips or fingernails
dizziness
difficulty walking or talking
blue lips or fingernails
Call 911
If you or someone around you experiences symptoms of an asthma emergency, call 911 or your local emergency number, or go to the nearest emergency department.

asthma,asthma causes,"Although asthma is especially common in children, many people don�t develop asthma until they are adults.
No single cause has been identified
for asthma. Instead, researchers believe it�s caused by a variety of factors. These factors include:
Genetics. If a parent or sibling has asthma, you�re more likely to develop it.
History of viral infections. People with a history of severe viral infections during childhood, such as respiratory syncytial virus infection (RSV), may be more likely to develop the condition.
Hygiene hypothesis. This theory explains that when babies aren�t exposed to enough bacteria in their early months and years, their immune systems don�t become strong enough to fight off asthma and other allergic conditions.
Many factors can also trigger asthma and cause symptoms to worsen. Triggers for asthma can vary and some people may be more sensitive to certain triggers than others.
The most common triggers include:
health conditions, such as respiratory infections
exercise
environmental irritants
allergens
intense emotions
extreme weather conditions
pests
certain medications, including aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)"
asthma,asthma diagnosis,"There�s no single test or exam that will determine if you or your child has asthma. Instead, your doctor will use a variety of criteria to determine if the symptoms are the result of asthma.
The following can help diagnose
asthma:
Health history. If you have family members with the breathing disorder, your risk is higher. Alert your doctor to this genetic connection.
Physical exam. Your doctor will listen to your breathing with a stethoscope. You may also be given a skin test to look for signs of an allergic reaction, such as hives or eczema. Allergies increase your risk for asthma.
Breathing tests. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) measure airflow into and out of your lungs. For the most common test, spirometry, you blow into a device that measures the speed of the air.
Doctors don�t typically perform breathing tests in children under 5 years of age because it�s difficult to get an accurate reading.
Instead, they may prescribe asthma medications to your child and wait to see if symptoms improve. If they do, your child likely has asthma.
For adults, your doctor may prescribe a bronchodilator or other asthma medication if test results indicate asthma. If symptoms improve with the use of this medication, your doctor will continue to treat your condition as asthma.
Your doctor will also need to determine the type of asthma you have. The most common type is allergic asthma, representing 60 percent
of all cases of asthma.
Additional types of asthma are related to a person�s stage in life. Though asthma can appear at any age, pediatric asthma specifically affects children and adult-onset asthma doesn�t appear until adulthood.
Other specific types of asthma are described below.
Allergic asthma
Allergens trigger this common type of asthma. These might include:
pet dander from animals like cats and dogs
food
mold
pollen
dust
Allergic asthma is often seasonal because it goes hand-in-hand with seasonal allergies.
Non-allergic asthma
Irritants in the air not related to allergies trigger this type of asthma. These irritants might include:
burning wood
cigarette smoke
cold air
air pollution
viral illnesses
air fresheners
household cleaning products
perfumes
Occupational asthma
Occupational asthma is a type of asthma induced by triggers in the workplace. These include:
dust
dyes
gases and fumes
industrial chemicals
animal proteins
rubber latex
These irritants can exist in a wide range of industries, including:
farming
textiles
woodworking
manufacturing
Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB)
Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) usually affects people within a few minutes of starting exercise and up to 10 to 15 minutes after physical activity.
This condition was previously known as exercise-induced asthma (EIA).
Up to 90 percent of people with asthma also experience EIB, but not everyone with EIB will have other types of asthma.
Aspirin-induced asthma
Aspirin-induced asthma (AIA), also called aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), is usually severe.
It�s triggered by taking aspirin or another NSAID, such as naproxen (Aleve) or ibuprofen (Advil).
The symptoms may begin within minutes or hours. People with AIA also typically have nasal polyps.
About 9 percent of people with asthma have AIA. It usually develops suddenly in adults between the ages of 20 and 50.
Nocturnal asthma
In this type of asthma, symptoms worsen at night.
Triggers that are thought to bring on symptoms at night include:
heartburn
pet dander
dust mites
The body�s natural sleep cycle may also trigger nocturnal asthma.
Cough-variant asthma (CVA)
Cough-variant asthma (CVA) doesn�t have classic asthma symptoms of wheezing and shortness of breath. It�s characterized by a persistent, dry cough.
If it�s not treated, CVA can lead to full-blown asthma flares that include the other more common symptoms."
asthma,asthma treatment,"To help treat asthma, the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP)
classifies the condition based on its severity before treatment.
Asthma classifications include:
Intermittent. Most people have this type of asthma, which doesn�t interfere with daily activities. Symptoms are mild, lasting fewer than 2 days per week or 2 nights per month.
Mild persistent. The symptoms occur more than twice a week � but not daily � and up to 4 nights per month.
Moderate persistent. The symptoms occur daily and at least 1 night every week, but not nightly. They may limit some daily activities.
Severe persistent. The symptoms occur several times every day and most nights. Daily activities are extremely limited.
Treatments for asthma fall into four primary categories:
quick relief medications
long-term control medications
a combination of quick relief and long-term control medications. The most current asthma clinical guidelines
, released in 2020 by the NAEPP, recommend this treatment. However this treatment is not yet approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA).
biologics, which are given by injection or infusion usually only for severe forms of asthma
Your doctor will recommend one treatment or a combination of treatments based on:
the type of asthma you have
your age
your triggers
Your treatment plan may also involve learning your triggers, monitoring your symptoms carefully, and taking steps to avoid flare-ups.
Quick-relief asthma treatments
These medications should only be used in the event of asthma symptoms or an attack. They provide quick relief to help you breathe again.
Bronchodilators
Bronchodilators work within minutes to relax the tightened muscles around your airwaves and decrease symptoms quickly.
Although they can be administered orally or injected, bronchodilators are most commonly taken with an inhaler (rescue) or nebulizer.
They can be used to treat sudden symptoms of asthma or taken before exercise to prevent a flare-up.
First aid asthma treatment
If you think that someone you know is having an asthma attack, tell them to sit them upright and assist them in using their rescue inhaler or nebulizer.
The dosage will vary depending on the medication. Check the instructions insert to make sure you know how many puffs of medications you need in the event of an attack.
If symptoms persist for more than 20 minutes, and a second round of medication doesn�t help, seek emergency medical attention.
If you frequently need to use quick-relief medications, ask your doctor about another type of medication for long-term asthma control.
Long-term asthma control medications
These medications are taken daily to help reduce the number and severity of your asthma symptoms, but they don�t manage the immediate symptoms of an attack.
Long-term asthma control medications include:
Anti-inflammatories. Taken with an inhaler, corticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory medications help reduce swelling and mucus production in your airways, making it easier to breathe.
Anticholinergics. These help stop your muscles from tightening around your airways. They�re usually taken daily in combination with anti-inflammatories.
Long-acting bronchodilators. These should only be used in combination with anti-inflammatory asthma medications.
Biologics
Doctors use biologics to treat severe asthma that doesn�t respond to other medications or to treatment by trigger control.
They work by targeting specific antibodies in your body. This disrupts the pathway that leads to asthma-causing inflammation.
There are five types of biologic medications on the market, and others in development. These medications need to be administered either by injection or by infusion in your doctor�s office.
Bronchial thermoplasty
This treatment uses an electrode to heat
the airways inside the lungs, helping to reduce the size of the surrounding muscle and prevent it from tightening.
This minimally invasive procedure is performed by a doctor in a clinic or hospital and usually takes around an hour.
Bronchial thermoplasty is intended for people with severe asthma and can provide relief from symptoms for up to 5 years
.
However, because it�s a relatively new procedure, it�s not yet widely available."
asthma,asthma prevention,"Because researchers have yet to identify the exact cause of asthma, it�s challenging to know how to prevent the inflammatory condition.
However, more information is known about preventing asthma attacks. These strategies include:
Avoiding triggers. Steer clear of chemicals, smells, or products that have caused breathing problems in the past.
Reducing exposure to allergens. If you�ve identified allergens, such as dust or mold, that trigger an asthma attack, avoid them if possible.
Getting allergy shots. Allergen immunotherapy is a type of treatment that may help alter your immune system. With routine shots, your body may become less sensitive to any triggers you encounter.
Taking preventive medication. Your doctor may prescribe medication for you to take on a daily basis. This medication may be used in addition to the one you use in case of an emergency.
Your doctor can help you put an asthma action plan in place so that you know which treatments to use and when.
In addition to using maintenance medications, you can take steps each day to help make yourself healthier and reduce your risk for asthma attacks. These include:
Eating a healthier diet. Eating a healthy, balanced diet can help improve your overall health.
Maintaining a moderate weight. Asthma tends to be worse in people with overweight and obesity. Losing weight is healthy for your heart, your joints, and your lungs.
Quitting smoking, if you smoke. Irritants such as cigarette smoke can trigger asthma and increase your risk for COPD.
Exercising regularly. Activity can trigger an asthma attack, but regular exercise may actually help reduce the risk of breathing problems.
Managing stress. Stress can be a trigger for asthma symptoms. Stress can also make stopping an asthma attack more difficult.
Nutrient-rich foods are vital to helping reduce symptoms, but food allergies can trigger asthma symptoms."
myocardial infarction,myocardial infarction definition,"Acute myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack, is a life-threatening condition that occurs when blood flow to the heart muscle is abruptly cut off, causing tissue damage.
This is usually the result of a blockage in one or more of the coronary arteries. A blockage can develop due to a buildup of plaque, a substance mostly made of fat, cholesterol, and cellular waste products or due to a sudden blood clot that forms on the blockage.
Call 911 or local emergency services right away if you think that you or someone you know may be having a heart attack."
myocardial infarction,myocardial infarction symptoms,"In an emergency
If you, or someone around you, experiences symptoms of a heart attack, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department.
Was this helpful?
While the classic symptoms of a heart attack are chest pain and shortness of breath, the symptoms can be quite varied. The most common symptoms of a heart attack include
:
pressure or tightness in the chest
pain in the chest, back, jaw, and other areas of the upper body that lasts more than a few minutes or that goes away and comes back
shortness of breath
sweating
nausea
vomiting
anxiety
feeling like you�re going to faint
a fast heart rate
sense of impending doom
It�s important to note that not all people who have heart attacks experience the same symptoms or the same severity of symptoms.
Chest pain is the most commonly reported symptom among both women and men. However, women are a bit more likely
than men to have more of the �atypical� symptoms, such as:
shortness of breath
jaw pain
upper back pain
lightheadedness
nausea
vomiting
In fact, some women who have had a heart attack report that their symptoms felt like the symptoms of the flu."
myocardial infarction,myocardial infarction causes,"Your heart is the main organ in your cardiovascular system, which also includes different types of blood vessels. Some of the most important vessels are the arteries. They take oxygen-rich blood to your body and all of your organs.
The coronary arteries take oxygen-rich blood specifically to your heart muscle. When these arteries become blocked or narrowed due to a buildup of plaque, the blood flow to your heart can decrease significantly or stop completely. This can cause a heart attack."
myocardial infarction,myocardial infarction risks,"A major trigger for heart problems can be
the fat content of food. People who eat a lot of processed and fried foods, as well as some meat and dairy foods that contain unhealthy saturated and trans saturated fats, are at a higher risk for heart disease. Obesity can increase this risk.
According to one study, replacing 2 percent
of calories consumed from carbs with trans fat could double the risk of heart disease.
In addition, your blood also contains fat known as triglycerides, which store
excess energy from the food that you eat. When the level of triglycerides in your blood is high, you may be more at risk for cardiovascular disease.
If, along with that, you also have a high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in your blood, your risk may be even higher. This is because LDL cholesterol can stick to the walls of your arteries and produce plaque, a hard substance that blocks
blood flow in the arteries.
Reducing your cholesterol and the unhealthy fat in your body typically requires eating a balanced diet that contains few processed foods, and when necessary, taking medications called statins.
Your doctor would be able to recommend the best nutrition plan for you and determine whether you need to take medications.
Additional risks
In addition to your diet, the following factors can also increase your risk of heart problems
:
High blood pressure. This can damage your arteries and accelerate the buildup of plaque.
High blood sugar levels. Having high levels of blood sugar can damage blood vessels and eventually lead to coronary artery disease.
Smoking. Smoking may increase your risk for heart attack and lead to other cardiovascular conditions and diseases.
Age. The risk of having a heart attack increases with age. Men are at a higher risk of a heart attack after age 45, and women are at a higher risk of a heart attack after age 55.
Sex. Not only do men have a significantly higher risk of having a heart attack than women, but they also often have heart attacks earlier in life.
Family history. You�re more likely to have a heart attack if you have a family history of early heart disease. Your risk is especially high if you have male family members who developed heart disease before age 55 or if you have female family members who developed heart disease before age 65.
Stress. Although the evidence for this is still limited, stress may also
be a trigger for acute myocardial infarction. Reducing chronic anxiety or stress can help reduce the risk of a heart attack and other heart problems over time.
Physical inactivity. Getting regular exercise can help keep your heart healthy by helping you maintain a moderate weight, as well as reduce your blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels.
Drug use. The use of certain drugs, including cocaine and amphetamines, can narrow the blood vessels, which could increase the risk of heart attack.
Preeclampsia. If you have a history of preeclampsia, or high blood pressure during pregnancy, you may be at a higher risk of developing heart problems later in life."
myocardial infarction,myocardial infarction diagnosis,"To determine whether you�ve had a heart attack, your doctor will look over the history of your symptoms, as well as your vital signs such as your blood pressure. Your doctor will then complete a physical exam with specific attention to the heart.
Your doctor will also run a number of different tests if they suspect that you�ve had a heart attack. An electrocardiogram (EKG) may be done to measure your heart�s electrical activity.
Blood tests will also be used to check for proteins that are associated with heart damage, such as troponin.
Your doctor may also perform an angiogram with coronary catheterization to look for areas of blockage in your arteries."
myocardial infarction,myocardial infarction prevention,"There are many steps you can take to prevent a heart attack, even if you�ve had one before.
One way to lower your risk is to eat a heart-healthy diet.
This diet should largely consist of:
whole grains
vegetables
fruits
lean protein
You should also try to reduce the following in your diet:
sugar
processed foods
This is especially important for people with diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol.
Exercising several times a week will also improve your cardiovascular health. If you�ve had a heart attack recently, you should speak with your doctor before starting a new exercise plan.
It�s also important to stop smoking if you smoke. Quitting smoking will significantly lower your risk of a heart attack and improve both your heart and lung health. You should also avoid being around secondhand smoke."
dementia,dementia definition,"Dementia is a neurodegenerative disease that has several different forms, symptoms, and causes. There�s currently no cure, but researchers are looking into effective treatments and ways to prevent it.
Dementia is a decline in cognitive function. To be considered dementia, mental impairment must affect at least two brain functions. Dementia may affect:
Dementia may be caused by a variety of illnesses or injuries. Mental impairment may range from mild to severe. It may also cause personality changes.
Some types of dementia are progressive. This means they get worse over time. Some types are treatable or even reversible. Some experts restrict the term �dementia� to irreversible mental deterioration."
dementia,dementia symptoms,"In its early stages, dementia can cause symptoms, such as:
Not coping well with change. Someone may have a hard time accepting changes in schedules or environment.
Subtle changes in short-term memory making. Someone can remember the events of 15 years ago like it was yesterday, but they can�t remember what they had for lunch.
Reaching for the right words. Word recollection or association may be more difficult.
Being repetitive. Someone may ask the same question, complete the same task, or tell the same story multiple times.
Confused sense of direction. Places someone once knew well may now feel foreign. They may also struggle with driving routes they�ve taken for years because it no longer looks familiar.
Struggling to follow storylines. Someone may find following a person�s story or description difficult.
Changes in mood. Depression, frustration, and anger are not uncommon for people with dementia.
Loss of interest. Apathy may occur in people with dementia. This includes losing interest in hobbies or activities that they once enjoyed.
Confusion. People, places, and events may no longer feel familiar. Someone might not remember people who know them.
Difficulty completing everyday tasks. A person in the early stages of dementia may have trouble recalling how to do tasks they�ve done for many years."
dementia,dementia causes,"Dementia has many causes. In general, it results from the degeneration of neurons (brain cells) or disturbances in other body systems that affect how neurons function.
Several conditions can cause dementia, including diseases of the brain. The most common causes are Alzheimer�s disease and vascular dementia.
Some of the more common causes of dementia include:
Neurodegenerative diseases
�Neurodegenerative� means that neurons gradually stop functioning or function inappropriately and eventually die.
This affects the neuron-to-neuron connections, called synapses, which arehow messages are passed along in your brain. This disconnect can result in a range of dysfunction.
Alzheimer�s disease
Parkinson�s disease with dementia
vascular dementia
chronic alcohol use disorder
Another cause is frontotemporal lobar degeneration. This is a blanket term for a range of conditions that cause damage to the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. They include:
frontotemporal dementia
Pick�s disease
supranuclear palsy
corticobasal degeneration
Other causes of dementia
Dementia has other causes, including:
structural brain disorders, such as normal pressure hydrocephalus and subdural hematoma
metabolic disorders, such as hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 deficiency, and kidney and liver disorders
toxins, such as lead
certain tumors or infections of the brain
medication side effects
Some of these types of dementia may be reversible. These treatable causes of dementia may reverse symptoms if they�re caught early enough. This is one of the many reasons why it�s important to contact your doctor and get a medical workup as soon as symptoms develop."
dementia,dementia treatment,"Two primary treatments are used to alleviate symptoms of dementia: medications and non-drug therapies. Not all medications are approved for each type of dementia, and no treatment is a cure.
Medications for dementia
Two main types of medication are used to treat symptoms of Alzheimer�s disease and other dementia-causing conditions:
Cholinesterase inhibitors. These drugs increase a chemical called acetylcholine. This chemical may help form memories and improve judgment. It may also delay worsening symptoms of Alzheimer�s disease.
Memantine. This drug is used to delay the onset of cognitive and behavioral symptoms in people with moderate or severe Alzheimer�s disease. Memantine may let people with Alzheimer�s disease maintain their usual mental functions for a longer period of time.
These two drugs may also be prescribed together. Side effects can occur. Other medications may be prescribed to treat related symptoms, such as impaired sleep, mood changes, and more.
Aducanumab (Aduhelm)
Aducanumab is another medication approved to treat Alzheimer�s and may slow the progression of the disease, though research is ongoing. Aducanumab is an anti-amyloid antibody therapy delivered intravenously. It targets a specific protein fragment that can disrupt communication between nerve cells in the brain.
Non-drug therapies
These therapies may help reduce symptoms of dementia and alleviate some of the manageable complications of the condition. Common non-drug treatments for dementia include:
Modifying your environment. Clutter, noise, and overstimulation may reduce focus.
Modifying common tasks. You can work with a therapist or other healthcare professional to break down everyday activities, such as showering or grooming, into manageable tasks.
Occupational therapy. Occupational therapists are specialized healthcare professionals who can help you learn to be safer and more secure with tasks including walking, cooking, and driving."
dementia,dementia prevention,"For decades, doctors and researchers believed dementia could not be prevented or cured. However, new research suggests that may not be the case.
A 2017 review found that more than one-third of dementia cases may be the result of lifestyle factors. Specifically, the researchers identified nine risk factors that may increase a person�s chance of developing dementia. They include:
midlife hypertension
midlife obesity
hearing loss
late-life depression
diabetes
physical inactivity
smoking
social isolation
lower levels of education
The researchers believe that targeting these risk factors with treatment or intervention could delay or possibly prevent some cases of dementia.
A 2019 retrospective study
looked at nearly 200,000 participants of European ancestry. The study suggested that lifestyle factors such as smoking status, physical activity, diet, and alcohol consumption could potentially contribute to the risk of dementia.
These findings suggest that working with your doctor to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle could help prevent or delay the onset of dementia."
hypothyroidism,hypothyroidism definition,"Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid doesn�t produce enough thyroid hormones, often causing symptoms like weight gain and fatigue. Medications and certain lifestyle changes may help ease symptoms.
Certain brands and strengths of medication for hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid)
. This is due to the medication having less active drug (levothyroxine) than it is supposed to.
Certain brands and strengths of medication for hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid)
. This is due to the medication having less active drug (levothyroxine) than it is supposed to.

"
hypothyroidism,hypothyroidism symptoms,"The effects of hypothyroidism on the body often vary among different people and may be difficult to identify. The severity of the condition also affects which signs and symptoms appear and when.
Early symptoms can include weight gain and fatigue. Note that these both become more common as you age, regardless of your thyroid�s health.
As a result, you may not realize that these changes are related to your thyroid until more symptoms appear. For instance, these may include skin changes associated with hypothyroidism, like scaly, rough, and dry skin and fragile nails.
In general, the most common signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism include:
fatigue
weight gain
depression
constipation
feeling cold
decreased sweating
slowed heart rate
elevated blood cholesterol
dry skin
dry, thinning hair
impaired memory
muscle weakness
muscle stiffness, aches, and tenderness
pain and stiffness in your joints
For most people, symptoms of the condition progress gradually over many years. As the thyroid slows more and more, the symptoms may become more easily identified. Of course, many of these symptoms also become more common with age in general.
If you suspect your symptoms are the result of a thyroid problem, talk with your doctor. They can order a blood test to determine whether you have hypothyroidism.
If you don�t already have a primary care doctor, you can browse doctors in your area through the Healthline FindCare tool.
Hypothyroidism symptoms in adults
Besides the most common hypothyroidism symptoms, research
indicates that hypothyroidism symptoms in men may also include erectile dysfunction.
Hypothyroidism symptoms in women may additionally include:
fertility difficulties
menstrual changes, particularly irregular or heavy periods
problems during pregnancy, including anemia
It�s also possible to develop hypothyroidism during pregnancy. Symptoms will usually be similar to those of other cases of hypothyroidism.
Hypothyroidism in young people
While hypothyroidism is less common in younger people, it can still occur. The condition may cause slower development in children and early puberty in teenagers.
Babies may also be born lacking thyroid function, a condition called congenital hypothyroidism. Symptoms of hypothyroidism in infants may include:
sleeping more than usual
constipation
difficulty with feeding
delayed growth (if the condition is untreated)
In some cases, babies with hypothyroidism may show no symptoms.
Severe hypothyroidism symptoms
If hypothyroidism isn�t treated, you may develop additional symptoms:
puffy, sensitive face
hoarseness
anemia
loss of hearing
In rare cases, severe hypothyroidism may result in myxedema coma, a life threatening condition that requires emergency care. While the condition does not actually involve being in a coma, you may experience:
fatigue
hypothermia
low blood pressure
low heart rate"
hypothyroidism,hypothyroidism causes,"The most common causes of hypothyroidism are:
Hashimoto�s thyroiditis
radioactive iodine treatment
thyroid surgery
radiation therapy
medications
iodine deficiency
Less common causes include:
pituitary disorders
congenital disease
pregnancy
de Quervain thyroiditis
Hashimoto�s thyroiditis
Your immune system is designed to protect your body�s cells against invading bacteria and viruses. When unknown bacteria or viruses enter your body, your immune system responds by sending fighter cells to destroy the foreign cells.
Sometimes, your body confuses normal, healthy cells for invading cells. This is called an autoimmune response. If the autoimmune response isn�t regulated or treated, your immune system can attack healthy tissues. This can cause serious medical issues, including conditions such as hypothyroidism.
Hashimoto�s thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition and the most common cause
of an underactive thyroid in the United States. This disease attacks your thyroid gland, causing damage that reduces thyroid function.
It most often affects middle-aged women, but it can occur in men and children. This condition also runs in families. If a family member has received a diagnosis of this disease, then your risk of having it is higher.
Radioactive iodine treatment for hyperthyroidism
If your thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, you have a condition known as hyperthyroidism. Treatment for this condition aims to reduce and regulate thyroid hormone production.
Standard treatment for hyperthyroidism uses radioactive iodine to destroy thyroid cells. This may cause the levels of your thyroid hormone to remain low permanently.
Surgical removal of your thyroid
If your entire thyroid gland is removed as a result of thyroid problems, you�ll develop hypothyroidism. Using thyroid medication long term is the primary treatment.
If only a portion of the gland is removed, your thyroid may still be able to produce enough hormones on its own. Blood tests will help determine how much thyroid medication you may need.
Radiation therapy
If you�ve received a diagnosis of cancer of the head or neck, lymphoma, or leukemia, you may have undergone radiation therapy. Radiation used for the treatment of these conditions may slow or halt the production of thyroid hormone, leading to hypothyroidism.
Medications
Several medications may lower thyroid hormone production, resulting in hypothyroidism. These include ones used to treat mental health conditions, cancer, or heart disease, such as:
lithium, which treats mania in bipolar disorder
interleukin-2 (IL-2), an immunotherapy drug
anti-CTLA-4 medications, which treat melanoma
amiodarone (Pacerone), an antiarrhythmic drug
stavudine, a medication for HIV
Iodine deficiency
Iodine deficiency occurs infrequently in the United States, but it is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in other parts of the world. Iodine, which is needed to produce thyroid hormone, is found in foods including:
iodized salt
dairy
seafood
eggs
If you have iodine deficiency, you may develop swelling at the base of your neck. This is called a goiter. It�s caused by an enlarged thyroid gland.
Pituitary disorders
Hypothyroidism may also result from problems involving the pituitary gland. This small gland in the brain produces hormones that affect many bodily functions, including the thyroid gland.
Problems with the pituitary gland may cause thyroid issues. Pituitary disorders may result from:
pituitary tumors
medications like dopamine and opioids
radiation therapy around the brain
Sheehan syndrome, which damages the pituitary gland
This type of hypothyroidism is called secondary hypothyroidism because the thyroid gland functions normally. It�s less common than primary hypothyroidism, which is caused by a problem with the thyroid gland.
Congenital disease
Congenital hypothyroidism is hypothyroidism that�s present in children from birth. It affects between 1 in 2,000 and 1 in 4,000 newborns and is twice as common in females.
The condition occurs when the thyroid gland develops abnormally or is not present at all. Genetics or iodine deficiency may cause this. While some babies may show no symptoms, others will be less active or have trouble feeding.
U.S. hospitals test newborns for the condition. It�s important to treat congenital hypothyroidism to prevent it from delaying growth or mental development.
Pregnancy
Around 5
to 10 percent
of pregnant people will develop postpartum thyroiditis several months after their pregnancy. While only some will need treatment, others will develop permanent hypothyroidism.
The following can increase the risk of postpartum thyroiditis:
history of postpartum thyroiditis
presence of antibodies to thyroid peroxidase in the blood
type 1 diabetes
De Quervain thyroiditis
An upper respiratory infection that damages thyroid cells may cause De Quervain thyroiditis, an uncommon condition that is also called subacute granulomatous thyroiditis. It�s most common in women and often occurs during the summer and fall
.
Symptoms of de Quervain thyroiditis include:
pain in the neck, jaw, and throat
enlarged, tender thyroid gland
fever
fatigue
body pain
The condition may cause hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism and last 2 to 8 weeks. Typically, thyroid function will then return to normal, though in some cases hypothyroidism may be permanent."
hypothyroidism,hypothyroidism risks,"Factors that can increase your risk of developing hypothyroidism include:
being female
being at least 60 years old
being treated with radiation therapy to your neck or chest
recently being pregnant
having a family history of thyroid disorders
having certain autoimmune conditions, such as Sj�gren�s disease and type 1 diabetes"
hypothyroidism,hypothyroidism diagnosis,"Two primary tools are used to determine whether you have hypothyroidism: a medical evaluation and blood tests.
Medical evaluation
Your doctor will complete a thorough physical exam and medical history. They�ll check for physical signs of hypothyroidism, including:
dry skin
slowed reflexes
swelling in the neck
a slower heart rate
In addition, your doctor will ask you to report any symptoms you�ve been experiencing, such as fatigue, constipation, or constantly feeling cold.
If you have a known family history of thyroid conditions, tell your doctor during this exam.
Blood tests
Blood tests are the only way to reliably confirm a diagnosis of hypothyroidism.
A thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test measures how much TSH your pituitary gland is creating:
If your thyroid isn�t producing enough hormones, the pituitary gland will boost TSH to increase thyroid hormone production. The high TSH levels indicate hypothyroidism.
If you have hyperthyroidism, your TSH levels will be low, as your body is trying to stop excessive thyroid hormone production.
A thyroxine (T4) level test is also useful in diagnosing hypothyroidism. T4 is one of the hormones directly produced by your thyroid. Used together, T4 and TSH tests can help evaluate thyroid function.
Typically, if you have a low level of T4 along with a high level of TSH, you have hypothyroidism. If you have subclinical hypothyroidism, though, you may have normal T4 with a high TSH level.
Since there�s a spectrum of thyroid disease, other thyroid function tests may be necessary to properly diagnose your condition.
If your T4 test is normal, you may also receive a triiodothyronine (T3) test. Low T3 levels may indicate hypothyroidism, though again, T3 levels may be normal in subclinical hypothyroidism.
Finally, thyroid antibody tests look for antibodies in your blood to diagnose autoimmune thyroid disorders like Hashimoto�s thyroiditis."
hypothyroidism,hypothyroidism treatment,"Besides standard thyroid medications, animal extracts that contain thyroid hormone are also available. These extracts come from the thyroid glands of pigs. They contain both T4 and triiodothyronine (T3).
If you take levothyroxine, you�re only receiving T4. However, that�s all you need because your body is capable of producing T3 from the synthetic T4.
Research has found medications with animal extracts to be similar to levothyroxine. Other studies have indicated that taking animal thyroid extract may reduce thyroid symptoms but cause more side effects. Currently, animal thyroid extracts aren�t routinely recommended.
You can also buy glandular extract supplements in some health food stores. Additionally, studies suggest that selenium supplements may help people with hypothyroidism caused by autoimmune disease, though research is mixed.
Note that dietary supplements aren�t regulated as drugs by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Because of this, their potency, legitimacy, and purity aren�t guaranteed.
Use these products at your own risk. It�s important to tell your doctor if you decide to try a supplement so they can adjust your treatment accordingly."

Neoplastic diseases are conditions that cause tumor growth. Growth can be either benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous).
Benign tumors usually grow slowly and can�t spread to other tissues. Conversely, malignant tumors can grow at a slow pace, but they can also grow very fast depending on the exact tumor type. Malignant tumors carry the risk of metastasis or spreading to multiple tissues and organs.
In this article, we go over the causes of neoplastic disease, along with the disease�s symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment."
malignant neoplasms or primary malignant neoplasm,malignant neoplasms or primary malignant neoplasm causes,"The exact causes of tumor growth are still being researched. In general, cancerous tumor growth is triggered by DNA mutations within your cells.
Your DNA contains genes that tell cells how to operate, grow, and divide. Your cells can�t function normally when the DNA changes. This change is what causes cells to become cancerous.
There are a number of contributing factors that can cause your genes to mutate and result in benign or malignant tumor growth. Common factors include:
genetics

Wear protective equipment when you work or play sports.
Inspect your feet daily for signs of injury or infection."
gastroesophageal reflux disease,gastroesophageal reflux disease definition,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is when contents of your stomach persistently move back up into your esophagus. These contents sometimes contain excessive acid and may irritate your esophagus.
Many people may experience acid reflux, indigestion, or heartburn from time to time. However, if you experience acid reflux symptoms more than twice per week, you may have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
GERD affects about 20%
of people in the United States.
If left untreated, it may lead to serious complications.
Read on to learn more about the symptoms, causes, and treatments for GERD."
gastroesophageal reflux disease,gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms,"The most common symptom of GERD is persistent heartburn, which may involve:
a burning feeling in your stomach that may rise to your chest, neck, and throat
a sour or bitter taste at the back of your mouth
regurgitation of food or liquid from your stomach into your mouth
Other possible symptoms of GERD include:
a feeling of fullness or of a lump in the back of your throat (globus sensation)
chronic cough
a hoarse voice
bad breath
In some cases, people may experience alarm
symptoms associated with GERD. These are typically persistent and could progressively worsen despite medical treatment. Alarm symptoms may also indicate an underlying condition.
Alarm symptoms may include:
difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
pain when swallowing (odynophagia)
nausea or vomiting
weight loss
anemia
bleeding
If you�re experiencing any of these, get medical attention.
Heartburn or heart attack?
Heartburn and heart attacks are two common causes of chest pain. However, their causes and sensations are typically different:
Heartburn may occur when acidic contents of your stomach move back up into your esophagus. This may cause a burning sensation that rises from your stomach and radiates into your chest.
Heart attack is when your heart doesn�t get enough blood and oxygen due to a reduced flow of blood in one or more major arteries. This may cause sudden, uncomfortable, or sharp pain in the center or left side of your chest that feels like pressure or squeezing. It could spread to your neck, jaw, and shoulder too.
If you�re feeling any heart attack symptoms, such as shortness of breath or faintness, get medical assistance immediately.

Symptoms in infants
It�s normal for babies to sometimes spit up food or vomit. But if your baby is frequently spitting or vomiting, they may have GERD.
Other signs and symptoms of GERD in infants might include:
refusal to eat
trouble swallowing
gagging or choking
wet burps or hiccups
irritability or arching of the back during or after feeding
weight loss or poor growth
recurring cough or pneumonia
difficulty sleeping
If you suspect that your baby might have GERD or another health condition, speak with a doctor."
gastroesophageal reflux disease,gastroesophageal reflux disease causes,"GERD commonly causes acid reflux, which may result from improper functioning of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).
The LES is a circular band of muscle at the end of your esophagus. When you swallow, it relaxes and opens up to allow food and liquid to travel from your mouth to your stomach. Then, it tightens and closes again.
Acid reflux happens when your LES doesn�t tighten or close properly. This allows digestive juices and other contents of your stomach to rise up into your esophagus.
Your LES may not function properly if you:
Have a hiatal hernia: This occurs when part of your stomach moves above your diaphragm toward your chest. If your diaphragm is compromised, it may prevent your LES from functioning properly.
Frequently eat large meals: This may cause distension of the upper part of your stomach. This distension sometimes means there isn�t enough pressure on the LES, and it doesn�t close properly.
Lie down too soon after meals: This might not create enough pressure for the LES to function properly.
Other factors, including those listed below, may also contribute to having heartburn more than twice a week.
Lifestyle factors
Lifestyle factors that may contribute to persistent reflux with esophageal inflammation include:
smoking or being exposed to secondhand smoke
eating large meals before lying down
using an abundance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen
Health factors
Health factors such as the following may contribute to GERD:
obesity
pregnancy
connective tissue disorders
older age
Other conditions
Other health conditions that can worsen the symptoms of GERD include:
anxiety
pregnancy
asthma
irritable bowel syndrome
Alcohol
Studies suggest that drinking alcohol may increase the risk of GERD. The greater the quantity of alcohol and frequency of consumption, the greater the correlation.
If you�ve received a diagnosis of GERD, limiting or stopping alcohol intake may provide symptom relief.
Dietary triggers
Some foods may trigger GERD symptoms more than others, including:
high fat foods such as fried and fast foods
spicy foods
certain fruits and vegetables, such as pineapple, tomato, and citrus
certain liquids, such as coffee, tea, and carbonated drinks"
gastroesophageal reflux disease,gastroesophageal reflux disease diagnosis,"A doctor will typically take your medical history and perform a physical examination to assess your symptoms.
If you�re experiencing alarm symptoms, such as chest pain or trouble swallowing, they may refer you to a gastroenterologist or request certain tests, including:
Ambulatory 24-hour pH probe: A small tube is inserted through your nose into your esophagus. A pH sensor at the tip of the tube measures how much acid exposure your esophagus is getting and sends the data to a portable computer. You wear this tube for about 24 hours.
Esophagram: After you drink a barium solution, healthcare professionals use X-ray imaging to examine your upper digestive tract.
Upper endoscopy: A flexible tube with a tiny camera is threaded into your esophagus to examine it and collect a tissue sample (biopsy) if needed.
Esophageal manometry: A flexible tube is passed through your nose into your esophagus to measure the strength of your esophageal muscles.
Esophageal pH monitoring: A monitor is inserted into your esophagus to help healthcare professionals find out how acid is regulated in your body over a few days.
After arriving at a diagnosis, your doctor will speak with you to decide what treatment plan will work best for you."
gastroesophageal reflux disease,gastroesophageal reflux disease treatment,"Lifestyle strategies
To manage and relieve symptoms of GERD, certain home remedies and lifestyle habits may help, including:
breathing exercises
consuming foods and liquids that may help with your acid reflux
making efforts to maintain a moderate weight
quitting smoking, if you smoke
avoiding eating big, heavy meals in the evening
waiting 2�3 hours after eating to lie down
elevating your head during sleep
Medication
If lifestyle strategies alone don�t help treat GERD, a doctor might prescribe medications to decrease your stomach acid secretion, since acid reflux is a common manifestation of GERD.
These may include:
proton pump inhibitors
antacids
H2 receptor blockers
Consult a doctor before taking medications because they may have negative side effects.
Surgery
In most cases, lifestyle strategies and medications are enough to prevent and relieve symptoms of GERD.
However, a doctor might recommend surgery if these approaches haven�t stopped your symptoms or if you�ve developed complications.
Possible surgery options include:
fundoplication
LINX reflux management system
bariatric surgery"
gastroesophageal reflux disease,gastroesophageal reflux disease complications,"For most people, GERD doesn�t cause serious complications.
However, in rare cases, it may lead to serious or life threatening health problems such as:
esophagitis, which is inflammation of your esophagus
esophageal stricture, which happens when your esophagus narrows or tightens
Barrett�s esophagus, which involves permanent changes to the lining of your esophagus
esophageal cancer, which affects a small portion of people with Barrett�s esophagus
tooth enamel erosion, gum disease, or other dental problems
To lower your chances of complications, it�s important to take the steps to prevent, manage, and treat symptoms of GERD."
deep vein thrombosis,deep vein thrombosis definition,"The changes that happen in the body during pregnancy can cause blood clotting. The risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is low, but symptoms may include swelling, pain in one leg, skin warmth and discoloration, visibly enlarged veins, and puffiness.
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that develops in a deep vein in the:
DVT is not common during pregnancy, but pregnant people are at least 5 times more likely
to develop DVT than people who aren�t pregnant, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Blood-clotting protein levels increase during pregnancy, while anticlotting protein levels decrease. This helps reduce the amount of blood lost during delivery.
The enlarging uterus during pregnancy may also increase the risk because it puts the veins of the lower body under additional pressure to return blood to the heart.
Read on to learn more about DVT and pregnancy."
deep vein thrombosis,deep vein thrombosis symptoms,"The most obvious symptom of DVT is swelling and heavy pain or extreme tenderness in one of your legs. Approximately 82%
of DVT cases in pregnancy occur in the left leg. Other symptoms of DVT can include:
pain in the leg when standing or moving around
pain in the leg that worsens when you bend your foot up toward your knee
warm skin in the affected area
visible veins that appear enlarged
discoloration or red skin at the back of the leg, typically below the knee
bluish toes
slight to severe swelling
Around 50%
of people with acute DVT may be asymptomatic. It occurs more often in post-op patients, particularly those who have undergone orthopedic surgery.
The chances of having asymptomatic DVT before or after pregnancy are unlikely
. But those with multiple risk factors should receive adequate screening for DVT, especially after cesarean delivery."
deep vein thrombosis,deep vein thrombosis symptoms,"You may experience muscle cramps during pregnancy. They typically affect the calf during the second and third trimesters, particularly at night. Muscle cramps during pregnancy are not a medical emergency.
They can be prevented or relieved with:
stretching and movement
hydration
massages
magnesium supplements
comfortable, supportive footwear
Swelling
Muscle cramps do not cause leg swelling. Unlike muscle cramps, stretching and moving around will not improve pain from DVT.

deep vein thrombosis,deep vein thrombosis diagnosis,"It�s not always easy to diagnose DVT in pregnancy from symptoms alone. A doctor may order multiple tests to confirm the diagnosis, including:
D-dimer test: This blood test identifies pieces of a blood clot that have broken off into your bloodstream. D-dimer levels above a certain threshold may indicate
a higher risk of PE, but doctors typically conduct further testing because levels normally fluctuate during pregnancy.
Doppler ultrasound: This scan determines how fast blood flows through a blood vessel. A Doppler ultrasound helps a healthcare team establish whether blood flow is slowed or blocked, a possible sign that indicates a blood clot.
Venogram: If a D-dimer test and ultrasound cannot confirm a DVT diagnosis, a doctor may use a venogram or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A venogram involves injecting a liquid called a contrast dye into a vein in your foot. The dye moves up the leg. The dye shows on an X-ray, which pinpoints a gap in the blood vessel where the clot stops the blood flow.
According to a 2019 review of over 40 studies, a venogram is the �gold standard� for a DVT diagnosis."
deep vein thrombosis,deep vein thrombosis treatment,"A doctor can form a treatment plan if you develop DVT during pregnancy. They may refer you to a specialist, such as a hematologist (blood specialist) and a maternal medicine or obstetric medicine specialist.
To treat DVT, a doctor may recommend once or twice daily injections of the blood-thinning agent low-molecular-weight heparin. This treatment may help to:
stop the clot from getting bigger
help the clot dissolve in the body
reduce the risk of further clots
You�ll likely have regular checkups and blood tests to ensure the clot dissolves and no further clots appear.
A doctor may recommend at-home practices for DVT in addition to medication. These may include daily walks, keeping the affected leg elevated when sitting, and following your prescribed anticoagulant medication schedule."
deep vein thrombosis,deep vein thrombosis complications,"Untreated, DVT can have lasting effects on the body.
Long-term DVT can lead to permanent swelling of the veins and fluid retention.
In rare cases, a clot can dislodge and move to the lungs, resulting in a PE.
Another rare complication from DVT is venous gangrene of the toes or fingers.
Irreparable damage to the veins from DVT may result in chronic post-thrombotic syndrome. This is a collection of symptoms associated with leg pain and ulcers.
Finally, taking anticoagulants raises the risk of side effects like bleeding. Report any unusual bleeding, such as nose bleeds, bloody stool/urine, or bruising, to a doctor if you take these medications."
deep vein thrombosis,deep vein thrombosis risks,"Factors that can increase your risk for DVT during pregnancy include:
having a previous history of clots or DVT
having a family history of DVT
being over 35
having a BMI of 30 or higher
carrying twins or multiple babies
having fertility treatment
having had a previous, recent cesarean delivery
sitting still or being bedridden for long periods
smoking
having preeclampsia
having certain chronic conditions such as high blood pressure (hypertension) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
having severe varicose veins
Race and DVT risk
Research indicates that DVT and PE occur more frequently
in Black Americans than in white Americans. The researchers speculate that this disparity has to do with increased risk factors, such as higher BMI and blood clotting protein levels. The data did not take pregnancy into account.

deep vein thrombosis,deep vein thrombosis prevention,"There isn�t a way to definitively prevent DVT in pregnancy. But taking certain steps can help to reduce your risk:
Stay active with pregnancy-safe exercises.
Wear compression socks during air travel and walk around at least once every hour.
Move your legs when sitting down, for example, by raising and lowering your heels and your toes and flexing your ankle.
Wear support hose.
Quit smoking, if you smoke.
See a doctor immediately if you notice any pain, tenderness, redness, or swelling in your legs.
Pregnant people at high risk for DVT may receive
a preventive dose of heparin, either during the entire pregnancy or for 6 to 8 weeks postpartum."
dehydration,dehydration definition,"Your body regularly loses water through sweating and urination. If it isn�t replaced, you get dehydrated. Adults at risk include athletes, people who work in the heat, older adults, and those with chronic conditions.
Dehydration takes place when your body loses more fluid than you drink. Common causes of dehydration include:
The Mayo Clinic recommends women drink 92 fluid ounces (11.5 cups) per day and men drink 124 fluid ounces (15.5 cups) daily. Individuals on the go, athletes and people exposed to high temperatures should increase their water intake to avoid dehydration.
When too much water is lost from the body, its organs, cells, and tissues fail to function as they should, which can lead to dangerous complications. If dehydration isn�t corrected immediately, it could cause shock.
Dehydration can be mild or severe. You can usually treat mild dehydration at home. Severe dehydration needs to be treated in a hospital or emergency care setting."
dehydration,dehydration risks,"Athletes exposed to direct sun aren�t the only ones at risk for dehydration. In fact, bodybuilders and swimmers are among the athletes who commonly develop the condition, too. Strange as it may seem, it�s possible to sweat in water. Swimmers lose a lot of sweat when swimming.
Some people have a higher risk for developing dehydration than others, including:
people working outdoors who are exposed to excessive amounts of heat (for example, welders, landscapers, construction workers, and mechanics)
older adults
people with chronic conditions
athletes (especially runners, cyclists, and soccer players)
infants and young children
people who reside in high altitudes"
dehydration,dehydration diagnosis,"Before beginning any tests, your doctor will go over any symptoms you have to rule out other conditions. After taking your medical history, your doctor will check your vital signs, including your heart rate and blood pressure. Low blood pressure and rapid heart rate can indicate dehydration.
Your doctor may use a blood test to check your level of electrolytes, which can help indicate fluid loss. A blood test can also check your body�s level of creatinine. This helps your doctor determine how well your kidneys are functioning, an indicator of the degree of dehydration.
A urinalysis is an exam that uses a sample of urine to check for the presence of bacteria and electrolyte loss. The color of your urine can also indicate dehydration when combined with other symptoms. Dark urine alone can�t diagnosis dehydration."

embolism pulmonary,embolism pulmonary symptoms,"Symptoms of a PE depend on the size of the clot and where it gets stuck in the lung.
The most common symptom of a PE is shortness of breath. This may be gradual or sudden.
Other symptoms include:
anxiety
clammy or bluish skin
chest pain that may extend into your arm, jaw, neck, and shoulder
fainting
irregular heartbeat
lightheadedness
rapid breathing
rapid heartbeat
spitting up blood
weak pulse
If you notice one or more of these symptoms, especially shortness of breath, you should seek medical attention immediately.
Read more: How to tell if you have a blood clot."
embolism pulmonary,embolism pulmonary causes,"Blood clots can form for a variety of reasons. PEs are most often caused by deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a condition in which blood clots form in veins deep in the body. The blood clots that most often cause PEs begin in the legs or pelvis.
Blood clots in the deep veins of the body can have several different causes, including:
Injury or damage. Injuries like bone fractures or muscle tears can cause damage to blood vessels, leading to clots.
Inactivity. During long periods of inactivity, gravity causes blood to collect in the lowest areas of your body, which may lead to a blood clot. This could occur if you�re sitting for a lengthy trip or if you�re lying in bed recovering from an illness.
Medical conditions. Some health conditions cause blood to clot easily, which can lead to PE. Treatments that involve surgery often lead to short-term bed rest or limited movement, which can make clotting more likely. Also, certain medical therapies for cancer can have side effects such as clotting in the blood. This puts you at risk for DVT and PE.
There are additional risk factors that increase your odds of having the type of blood clot that can cause PE."
embolism pulmonary,embolism pulmonary diagnosis,"PE has a wide variety of characteristics, ranging from no symptoms to sudden death. The most common presenting symptom is shortness of breath followed by chest pain and cough. However, many people with PE have mild or nonspecific symptoms or are asymptomatic, including people with a large PE.
When you talk with a doctor about your symptoms, they�ll ask about your overall health and any preexisting conditions you may have.
A doctor will typically perform one or more of the following tests to discover the cause of your symptoms:
Chest X-ray. This is a standard, noninvasive test that lets a doctor see your heart and lungs to look for other obvious causes of your symptoms. A PE can not be diagnosed with this test. The most common finding of a PE on a chest X-ray is �normal.�
Electrocardiography (ECG). An ECG measures your heart�s electrical activity. A PE can not be diagnosed on an ECG. This test will check for other causes of chest pain.
Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). This test is the first-choice diagnostic imaging method because it�s sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of PE. However, it requires the use of intravenous (IV) contrast. Therefore, people with kidney problems will likely not be able to have this test because contrast may cause or worsen kidney disease. When a CTPA can not be performed, the doctor may instead consider a VQ scan to diagnose a PE.
Ventilation/perfusion scan (VQ). A VQ scan is carried out in two parts. In the first part, radioactive material is breathed in, and pictures are taken to look at the airflow in your lungs. In the second part, a different radioactive material is injected into a vein in your arm, and more images are taken to see the blood flow in your lungs. This is mostly reserved for when:
you can not receive a CTPA
the results of the CPTA were inconclusive
more testing is needed
Magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography (MRPA). This is not recommended as a first-line test for diagnosing PE, but it may be an imaging option to diagnose PE in people who can neither receive a CTPA nor a VQ scan. Potential advantages of MRPA are that no ionizing radiation is involved, and the examination can be combined with MR venography in the same sitting to look for DVT.
Venography. A venogram is an invasive test that is rarely used for the diagnosis of only a DVT. This is a specialized X-ray of the veins in your legs and also requires the use of contrast.
Pulmonary angiography. A pulmonary angiography is an invasive test that�s rarely used to diagnose an acute PE. It involves making a small incision so a doctor can guide specialized tools through your veins. The doctor will use contrast to see the blood vessels in the lung.
Duplex venous ultrasound. This is a practical and noninvasive test to only diagnose a DVT. It�s important to remember that you can still have a PE even if the ultrasound is negative for a DVT. This test uses radio waves to visualize the blood flow and check for blood clots in your legs.
D-dimer test. This is a type of blood test used to screen for signs of a PE or DVT based on the your probability of having a clot. A doctor can not make a diagnosis based on this blood test. If the result is positive, the doctor must confirm the diagnosis with the appropriate imaging method.
Acute PE, a blockage in the lung artery, often from a blood clot, is a common and sometimes fatal disease. When you�re evaluated for a PE, it�s often important for the evaluation to be efficient and avoid unnecessary testing so you can start therapy quickly.

embolism pulmonary,embolism pulmonary prevention,"After you receive proper treatment for a pulmonary embolism at the hospital, you�ll be advised to treat the underlying cause of the PE or DVT if it�s known.
You�ll most likely start taking anticoagulant medications, such as heparin, warfarin, or newer agents referred to as direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), to prevent blood clots from returning.
Regularly exercising your legs and practicing health-promoting behaviors are key components of prevention and therapy after a PE. A doctor will give you complete instructions on how to care for yourself to prevent future blood clots."
epilepsy,epilepsy definition,"A seizure is a sudden change in movement or awareness due to a change in the electrical function of the brain. Sudden bursts of electrical energy may affect movement, sensation and consciousness.
Seizures are changes in the brain�s electrical activity. These changes can cause dramatic, noticeable symptoms, subtle or mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all.
The symptoms of a severe seizure include repetitive jerking and stiffening and a loss of control. Because some seizures can lead to injury or be a sign of an underlying medical condition, it�s important to seek treatment if you experience them."
epilepsy,epilepsy symptoms,"A person can have an epilepsy condition that causes both focal and generalized seizures at different times, but not simultaneously.
A focal seizure can progress to become a generalized seizure. Sometimes this happens slowly and sometimes it can happen rapidly.
Sometimes symptoms occur before the seizure takes place. These can include:
a sudden feeling of fear or anxiousness
a feeling of being sick to your stomach
dizziness
a change in vision
a jerky movement of the arms and legs that may cause you to drop things
an out-of-body sensation
a headache
d�j� vu
mood changes
Signs that indicate a seizure is in progress include:
losing consciousness, followed by confusion
having uncontrollable muscle spasms
drooling or frothing at the mouth
falling
having a strange taste in your mouth
clenching your teeth
biting your tongue
having sudden, rapid eye movements
making unusual noises, such as grunting
losing control of bladder or bowel function
Learn more about what a seizure feels like here."
epilepsy,epilepsy causes,"Seizures can stem from several health conditions. Some examples include:
alcohol withdrawal
a brain infection, such as meningitis
a brain injury during childbirth
a brain irregularity present at birth
choking
substance use
substance withdrawal
an electrolyte imbalance
electric shock
epilepsy
extremely high blood pressure
fever
head trauma
kidney or liver failure
low blood glucose levels
a stroke
a brain tumor
vascular abnormality in the brain
Seizures can run in families. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has a history of seizures. In some instances, especially with young children, the cause of the seizure may be unknown."
epilepsy,epilepsy diagnosis,"Your doctor may recommend specific tests to accurately diagnose a seizure and help ensure that the treatments they recommend will be effective.
Your doctor will consider your complete medical history and the events leading up to the seizure. For example, migraine, headaches, sleep disorders, and extreme psychological stress can cause seizure-like symptoms.
Lab tests may help your doctor rule out other conditions that can cause seizure-like activity. The tests may include:
blood testing to check for electrolyte imbalances
a spinal tap to rule out infection
a toxicology screening to test for drugs, poisons, or toxins
An electroencephalogram (EEG) can help your doctor diagnose a seizure. This test measures your brain waves. Viewing brain waves during a seizure can help your doctor diagnose the type of seizure. An EEG can show evidence of seizure activity even when a person isn�t having a seizure. But an EEG can also be completely normal when a person is not having a seizure.
Imaging scans, such as a CT scan or MRI scan, can also help by providing a clear picture of the brain. These scans allow your doctor to see abnormalities like brain damage or a tumor."
epilepsy,epilepsy prevention,"In many instances, a seizure isn�t preventable. But maintaining a healthy lifestyle can give you the best chance at reducing your risk. You can do the following:
Get plenty of sleep.
Eat a balanced diet and drink plenty of fluids.
Exercise regularly.
Engage in stress-reducing techniques.
Don�t take illegal substances.
If you�re on medication for epilepsy or other medical conditions, take them as your doctor recommends."
cardiomyopathy,cardiomyopathy definition,"Cardiomyopathy is a progressive disease of the myocardium, or heart muscle. In most cases, the heart muscle weakens and is unable to pump blood to the rest of the body as well as it should.
There are many different types of cardiomyopathy, caused by a range of factors, from coronary heart disease to certain drugs. Cardiomyopathy can lead to an irregular heartbeat, heart failure, or other complications.
Medical treatment and follow-up care are important. They can help prevent heart failure or heart damage.
This article will take a closer look at the types of cardiomyopathy, as well as the symptoms, causes, and treatment."
cardiomyopathy,cardiomyopathy symptoms,"The symptoms of all types of cardiomyopathy tend to be similar. In all cases, the heart can�t adequately pump blood to the tissues and organs of the body. It can result in symptoms such as:
general weakness and fatigue
shortness of breath, particularly during exertion or exercise
lightheadedness or dizziness
chest pain
heart palpitations
fainting spells
high blood pressure
a bloated abdomen
coughing when lying down
edema, or swelling, of your feet, ankles, legs, or other body parts"
cardiomyopathy,cardiomyopathy causes,"According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
, the cause of cardiomyopathy is often unknown. In other cases, the cause can either be inherited or acquired:
�Inherited� means that you�re born with cardiomyopathy due to the genes you inherited from your parents.
�Acquired� means that you developed cardiomyopathy due to a health condition, disease, or some other type of illness during the course of your life, such as:
coronary artery disease
heart tissue damage due to a heart attack
infections in the heart muscle"
cardiomyopathy,cardiomyopathy risks,"Cardiomyopathy can affect people of all ages. Major risk factors include:
a family history of cardiomyopathy, sudden cardiac arrest, or heart failure
coronary artery disease
chronic (long-term) high blood pressure
damage to the heart due to a heart attack
infections that cause inflammation of the heart
heart valve disorders
COVID-19 infection
diabetes
obesity
thyroid disease
alcohol use disorder
sarcoidosis
hemochromatosis
amyloidosis
connective tissue disorders
use of cocaine or amphetamines
some types of cancer medications
exposure to toxins, such as poison or heavy metals
According to 2016 research
, HIV and HIV treatments can also increase your risk of cardiomyopathy. HIV can increase your risk of heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy, in particular.
If you have HIV, talk with a doctor about getting regular tests to check your heart�s health. You should also try to follow a heart-healthy diet and exercise program."
cardiomyopathy,cardiomyopathy diagnosis,"Your doctor or cardiologist will incorporate the results of four components into your diagnosis:
your personal medical history
your family medical history
physical examination
diagnostic tests and procedures
The diagnostic tests and procedures your doctor or cardiologist may use include:
Blood tests. Blood tests can provide information about your heart and also help rule out other conditions.
Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can help your doctor see the size and structure of your heart and lungs and check for any fluid buildup.
Stress test. A stress test gauges your heart function while you exercise.
Electrocardiogram. An electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) is used to assess your heart�s electrical activity over a short period of time.
Holter monitor. A Holter or event monitor can measure your heart�s electrical activity over 24 or 48 hours.
Echocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to create live images of your heart and how it�s beating.
Heart MRI. A heart MRI uses magnets and radio waves to capture images of your heart and coronary blood vessels.
Your doctor may also perform some diagnostic procedures to confirm the diagnosis, especially if you�re planning to have surgery. These procedures may include:
Cardiac catheterization. With cardiac catheterization, a long, thin tube is inserted into an artery or vein and threaded up to your heart so your doctor can evaluate your heart for a number of potential issues, including artery blockages.
Coronary angiography. With coronary angiography, your doctor injects dye into your bloodstream to look at the flow of blood through your arteries and heart.
Myocardial biopsy. A myocardial biopsy is a procedure that involves removing a small part of your heart�s tissue so it can be examined under a microscope."
cardiomyopathy,cardiomyopathy prevention,"If cardiomyopathy runs in your family, you may not be able to completely prevent it. But, you can take steps to keep your heart healthy and minimize the impact of this condition.
Even if cardiomyopathy isn�t part of your family history, it�s still important to take steps to make sure you don�t develop a heart condition or disease that could put you at an increased risk of cardiomyopathy.
The steps
you can take to help lower your risk of cardiomyopathy include:
Getting regular exercise. Try to limit how much you sit each day, and focus on getting at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week.
Getting enough sleep. Sleep deprivation is linked to an increased risk of heart disease. Try to get at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night.
Eating a heart-healthy diet. Try to limit your intake of sugary, fried, fatty, and processed foods. Focus instead on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, nuts, seeds, and low fat dairy. Also limit your intake of salt (sodium), which can raise your risk of high blood pressure.
Reducing your stress levels. Try to find healthy ways to lower your stress when possible. You may want to consider taking regular brisk walks, doing deep breathing exercises, meditating, doing yoga, listening to music, or talking with a trusted friend.
Quitting smoking, if you smoke. Smoking can negatively affect your entire cardiovascular system, including your heart, blood, and blood vessels.
Managing underlying health conditions. Work closely with your doctor to control and manage any underlying health conditions that may raise your risk of cardiomyopathy."
chronic kidney failure,chronic kidney failure definition,Chronic kidney failure occurs when your kidneys are damaged and cannot filter waste from your body effectively. You may experience more symptoms as the condition progresses.
chronic kidney failure,chronic kidney failure symptoms,"If you�re in the early stages of chronic kidney failure, you may or may not have symptoms.
Some early symptoms of kidney failure can also occur with other illnesses and conditions. This can make diagnosis difficult.
Early symptoms can include:
high blood pressure
swelling in your hands or feet
urinary tract infections
protein in your urine
blood in your urine
If the damage to your kidneys gets worse, you will eventually notice symptoms. Later stage symptoms can include:
difficulty staying alert
cramps and twitches
numbness in your limbs
weakness
fatigue
bad breath
skin that�s darker or lighter than usual
bone pain
excessive thirst
bleeding and bruising easily
insomnia
urinating more or less than usual
hiccups
swollen feet and ankles
missing menstrual periods
shortness of breath
Chronic kidney disease can also lead to other complications. These may include:
pulmonary edema (fluid buildup in your lungs) and fluid buildup in other areas
vitamin D deficiency, which can affect your bone health
nerve damage that can lead to seizures
anemia
cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke
electrolyte imbalance
sexual dysfunction and impotence
uremia
infertility
inability to maintain weight"
chronic kidney failure,chronic kidney failure causes,"Diabetes and high blood pressure can commonly lead
to chronic kidney failure.
Other causes can include:
damage to kidney function
recurring kidney infections
inflammation in your kidneys� filtration system
congenital kidney disease
obstruction of your urinary tract
autoimmune disorders
You may be at a higher risk of chronic kidney failure if you:
smoke cigarettes
have obesity
have diabetes
have heart disease
have high cholesterol
have a family history of kidney disease
are over age 65"
chronic kidney failure,chronic kidney failure diagnosis,"If you have high blood pressure, diabetes, or another condition that puts you at higher risk of kidney failure, a doctor will likely routinely monitor your kidney function.
Regular checkups and reporting symptoms can help doctors diagnose chronic kidney failure early.
Physical exam
At your appointment, a doctor will perform a physical exam.
Kidney failure can cause fluids to back up in your lungs or heart. A doctor may examine these organs by listening to them with a stethoscope.
Blood and urine tests
If a doctor thinks you might have chronic kidney failure, they will likely order blood and urine tests.
Blood tests for kidney function measure the levels of electrolytes and waste in your blood. They measure waste products such as. These can include:
Creatinine: Creatinine is a byproduct of muscle metabolism.
Blood urea: Blood urea is left over when your body breaks down proteins.
When your kidneys are working properly, they excrete both substances.
Urine tests can measure your kidney function.
A urine protein test measures how much protein is in your urine. Urine typically contains only trace amounts of protein. An elevated protein level may indicate kidney problems months or even years before other symptoms appear.
Imaging tests
Imaging tests can provide structural details of your kidneys. These can include:
kidney ultrasound
MRI
CT scan
Biopsy
A doctor may also order a biopsy. This can be performed as a needle biopsy or an open biopsy.
A needle biopsy is the most common type of kidney biopsy. During this procedure, a doctor or technician inserts a needle into your kidney. This is considered a minimally invasive procedure.
During an open biopsy, a doctor will use a surgical incision to expose your kidney. This procedure requires strict sterile techniques and general anesthesia.
After the doctor collects a sample of kidney tissue, they will send it to a lab for microscopic examination.
Testing results and follow-up
The results of your examination will help the doctor make a diagnosis. It can also help them determine the cause of your kidney failure.
If you receive a diagnosis of chronic kidney failure, you will likely need regular blood tests. These measure various substances in your body, such as:
calcium
potassium
cholesterol
sodium
magnesium
phosphorous
You may also need ongoing kidney function tests to measure your creatinine and urea levels."
chronic kidney failure,chronic kidney failure treatment,"There is no cure for chronic kidney failure. However, certain measures can slow its progression.
Medication
Medication can help treat the symptoms of chronic kidney failure.
Kidney failure is linked to high blood pressure, so a doctor may prescribe medication to lower your blood pressure. You might also need medications called statins to lower your cholesterol level.
People with chronic kidney failure may also experience anemia. Anemia occurs when your body doesn�t produce enough red blood cells. Treatments for anemia can include:
a supplement to help increase your red blood cell production
iron pills or shots to help your body manufacture blood cells
a blood transfusion to improve your red blood cell health, in some cases
If your kidney problem causes fluid retention, medications called diuretics can help relieve your swelling. This medication makes you urinate frequently.
A doctor may also prescribe medication to support your bone health. This can include:
calcium supplements
vitamin D supplements, as vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption
phosphate binders, as high levels of phosphate can reduce calcium absorption
Antihistamines can help relieve itchy skin and antiemetics can help with nausea.
Diet
A doctor may also recommend certain dietary changes, including reducing your intake of certain nutrients.
These can include
:
Protein: As your body processes protein, it creates waste products. Your kidneys are responsible for filtering this waste. A lower protein diet makes their job easier.
Potassium: When your kidneys are not functioning well, they may not filter potassium properly. In people with chronic kidney failure, high levels of potassium (hyperkalemia) can be life threatening. It can lead to issues with heart function or paralysis. Doctors may recommend a low potassium diet.
Phosphate: Your kidneys may not be able to process phosphate either. Phosphate can also diminish your body�s ability to absorb calcium. High phosphate foods include fish, dairy products, eggs, and meat. You may need to eat less of these.
Salt and sodium: Consuming too much sodium can make it hard for your body to maintain fluid levels. Reading labels may help you manage your intake. Many prepared foods, such as canned soup or fast food, can be high in sodium.
You can work with a dietitian or a doctor to find out how much of these substances you should eat.
You may also need to limit your fluid intake so your kidneys don�t have to work too hard.
People with chronic kidney failure often lose weight. Make sure you�re consuming enough calories from foods approved and recommended by a dietitian.
Lifestyle
Certain lifestyle practices may help slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. These can include:
quitting smoking, if you smoke
keeping up to date on your vaccinations, including your flu shot
discuss supplements and over-the-counter (OTC) medications with a doctor before taking them
If you see other doctors for different conditions, always inform them of your kidney situation.
End stage treatment
If attempts to control your condition through diet and medication fail, you might face end stage kidney disease.
End stage kidney disease, also known as end stage renal disease (ESRD), occurs when your kidneys operate at less than 15%
of their full capacity. At this stage, your kidneys can no longer eliminate waste as fast as you produce it.
There are two treatment options for end stage kidney disease: dialysis and kidney transplant.Doctors typically try to postpone these options as long as possible because both carry serious risks.
Dialysis
Dialysis is a system for filtering waste products and excess fluids out of your blood.
The two main types of dialysis include:
Hemodialysis: In hemodialysis, your blood is filtered outside your body in a machine.
Peritoneal dialysis: In peritoneal dialysis, you fill your abdominal cavity with a special solution via a catheter. The solution absorbs excess fluid and waste before it�s drained from your body.
Because dialysis usually needs to be done several times a week, it�s a big lifestyle change. Dialysis also carries a risk of infection.
Kidney transplant
Kidney transplant is more convenient than dialysis if you can find an appropriate donor kidney. The donor needs to have the same blood type as you.
A kidney from a living sibling or other close relative is usually best. You could also get your kidney from a deceased donor.
However, kidney transplants also carry a large risk of infection because you will need lifelong immunosuppression."
chronic kidney failure,chronic kidney failure prevention,"You may be able to prevent kidney failure with certain lifestyle changes. Here are some general guidelines:
If they consume alcohol, people over 65 should limit themselves to no more than one drink per day. Males who are younger than 65 should stop at two drinks or fewer.
Manage your blood pressure.
If you have diabetes, manage your blood sugar.
If needed, try to maintain a moderate weight. This can mean consuming fewer calories and increasing your activity. A doctor can make provide healthy weight loss guidelines.
OTC pain relievers can cause kidney damage. Follow the directions on the package, only take them as needed, and discuss the use of pain relievers with a doctor if you have any kidney concerns.
If you smoke cigarettes, consider quitting."
carcinoma,carcinoma definition,"What is basal cell carcinoma?
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a type of skin cancer that begins in the basal cells. Normal basal cells line the epidermis. They�re the skin cells that replace old cells with new ones. Cancer of the basal cells results in tumors that appear on the skin�s surface. These tumors often look like sores, growths, bumps, scars, or red patches.
While BCC almost never spreads to other places in the body (metastasizes), it can still result in disfigurement. In rare cases, it can spread to other parts of the body. If it does, it can become life-threatening.
BCC is the most common type of skin cancer. Approximately 4 million cases of it are diagnosed in the United States every year."
carcinoma,carcinoma symptoms,"Almost all BCCs develop on parts of the body frequently exposed to the sun. Tumors can develop on the face, ears, shoulders, neck, scalp, and arms. In very rare cases, tumors develop on areas not often exposed to sunlight.
BCCs are typically painless. The only symptom is the growth or change in the appearance of the skin. There are different types of BCC. Each has a different appearance:
Pigmented BCC: This type appears as a brown, blue, or black lesion, which often has a translucent and raised border.
Superficial BCC: This type takes on the appearance of a reddish patch on the skin, which is often flat and scaly. It continues to grow and often has a raised edge. It typically takes on this appearance when on the back or chest.
Nonulcerative BCC: This type appears as a bump on the skin that is white, skin-colored, or pink. It�s often translucent, with blood vessels underneath that are visible. This is the most common type of BCC. It most commonly appears on the neck, ears, and face. It can rupture, bleed, and scab over.
Morpheaform BCC: This is the least common type of BCC. It typically resembles a scarlike lesion with a white and waxy appearance and no defined border. This type of carcinoma can indicate a particularly invasive form of BCC, which is more likely to be disfiguring.
Basosquamous BCC: This type of carcinoma carries traits of both BCC and squamous cell carcinoma, another type of skin cancer. It is extremely rare, but is more likely to metastasize compared with other types of skin cancer."
carcinoma,carcinoma causes,"Skin cancers, including BCC, are primarily caused by long-term sun or ultraviolet (UV) light exposure. These cancers can also be caused by intense occasional exposure often resulting in sunburn.
In rarer cases, other factors can cause BCC. These include:
exposure to radiation
exposure to arsenic
complications from scars, infections, vaccinations, tattoos, and burns
chronic inflammatory skin conditions
Once diagnosed with BCC, there is a strong likelihood of recurrence."
carcinoma,carcinoma risks,"There are a number of risk factors that can increase the likelihood of developing BCC. Some of these risk factors include:
having a family history of BCC
having light skin
having skin that freckles or burns easily
having inherited syndromes that cause skin cancer, like disorders of the skin, nervous system, or endocrine glands
having fair skin, red or blonde hair, or light-colored eyes
being a man
There are other, nongenetic risk factors. These include:
age, with increased age correlating with increased risk
chronic sun exposure
severe sunburn, especially during childhood
living in a higher altitude or sunny location
exposure to radiation therapy
exposure to arsenic
taking immunosuppressing drugs, especially after a transplant surgery"
carcinoma,carcinoma diagnosis,"The first step in diagnosing BCC will be a visual inspection from a dermatologist. They�ll check your skin head-to-toe to look for any skin growths or discolorations. They�ll also ask about your medical history, including family history of skin cancers.
If your dermatologist finds any discolorations or growths of concern, they�ll take a biopsy of the skin. To do this, they�ll inject a numbing agent into the skin before removing a small sample of the lesion for testing. The biopsy will be viewed under a microscope to look for skin cancer.
Your dermatologist will remove the growth if BCC is found. If you have an aggressive form of BCC, your doctor may take a biopsy of your lymph nodes to check for metastasis."
carcinoma,carcinoma treatment,"BCC treatments are often minor and easy to recover from. Many people will experience some pain at the surgery or excision site as it heals.
Scarring is a common effect of BCC treatment. To lessen the appearance of scars, follow the after-treatment instructions your doctor gives you. These instructions will include:
Keep the excision site clean.
Apply over-the-counter ointments like Vaseline and Neosporin multiple times a day to help it heal, and keep it covered with a bandage.
Keep the wound moist. This will help it heal.
There is a high risk of recurrence of BCC. Take precautions to protect your skin from UV exposure."
carcinoma,carcinoma causes,"The most common complication of basal cell carcinoma is recurrence. BCCs commonly recur, even after successful treatment. In some cases, BCC may reappear in the same place. It can also be disfiguring, especially if not treated promptly.
A diagnosis of BCC increases the chance of developing other types of skin cancer. This includes melanoma, which can metastasize and is the most life-threatening form of skin cancer.
Rare, aggressive forms of BCC can invade the body beyond the skin. It can destroy bone, nerves, and muscles. In rare cases it can metastasize to other parts of the body, including key organs, and become life-threatening."
carcinoma,carcinoma prevention,"Avoiding or reducing your exposure to UV light is the best way to prevent BCC. Avoid direct sunlight during the brightest parts of the day and avoid using tanning beds.
Apply sunscreen regularly, even if you�re only going to be outside for a few minutes. Use a sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher. You can also wear lightweight clothing and hats to protect against sun exposure. The exception to this is infants. Newborns should be kept out of the sun when possible. Don�t apply sunscreen to infants under six months.
Early detection of BCC can reduce scarring caused by the removal of a tumor. Get a skin cancer check annually from a dermatologist or primary doctor. You should also examine your skin head-to-toe on a monthly basis. If you notice any skin changes, make an appointment with a doctor."
hepatitis C,hepatitis C definition,"What is acute hepatitis C?
In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 40,000 people
are acutely infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The acute form of this viral infection may produce only brief symptoms, so some people never know they have it. That can lead to the development of a more serious form of this infection."
hepatitis C,hepatitis C symptoms,"Symptoms don�t always appear immediately. Symptoms may be noticeable within 14 days but may take as long as six months to produce any sign. The average period it takes to show symptoms is six to seven weeks
. However, most people who contract acute hepatitis C never experience any symptoms.
Symptoms of acute hepatitis C range from very mild to severe. They include:
nausea
vomiting
loss of appetite
fever
fatigue
abdominal pain
joint pain
dark urine
light, clay-colored bowel movements
jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and eyes
If your doctor suspects that you have hepatitis C, they will draw blood to check for HCV antibodies. Antibodies are substances your body produces when it�s fighting an infection. If you have them, your doctor may order a second test to confirm that the virus is still present.
If you are positive for the presence of HCV, your doctor may want to check your liver enzyme levels. This lets them know if the disease has affected your liver. Some people with the virus will have normal levels."
hepatitis C,hepatitis C risks,"Those most at risk for acute and chronic hepatitis C are people who use or share contaminated needles. Mothers can transmit HCV to their babies during childbirth, but not through breastfeeding. Other risk factors for transmission of HCV include:
healthcare work, especially work around needles
getting a tattoo or body piercing with unsterile equipment
undergoing hemodialysis
living in a household with someone with HCV
sharing personal hygiene products, such as razors or toothbrushes
engaging in sexual activity with multiple partners without condoms or dental dams
having a blood transfusion or organ transplant before July 1992 or receiving clotting factors before 1987
The most serious long-term risk of acute hepatitis C is developing chronic hepatitis C, which can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. In 75 to 85 percent of those with acute hepatitis C, the disease will progress to the more serious chronic hepatitis C."
hepatitis C,hepatitis C prevention,"Early detection and treatment are the best ways to prevent the more serious form of hepatitis C. There�s no vaccine for hepatitis C, so the best way to prevent it is to avoid any situations in which you could come into contact with another person�s blood.

psychotic disorder,psychotic disorder definition,"The exact cause of psychosis isn�t always clear. It�s important to seek help if you experience hallucinations, delusions, or trouble thinking clearly. Most people recover with treatment, such as therapy and medication.
Psychosis is a combination of symptoms resulting in an impaired relationship with reality. It can be a symptom of serious mental health disorders. People who are experiencing psychosis may have either hallucinations or delusions.
Hallucinations are sensory experiences that occur within the absence of an actual stimulus. For example, a person having an auditory hallucination may hear their mother yelling at them when their mother isn�t around. Or someone having a visual hallucination may see something, like a person in front of them, who isn�t actually there.
The person experiencing psychosis may also have thoughts that are contrary to actual evidence. These thoughts are known as delusions. Some people with psychosis may also experience loss of motivation and social withdrawal.
These experiences can be frightening. They may also cause people who are experiencing psychosis to hurt themselves or others.
It�s important to get medical help right away if you or someone else is experiencing symptoms of psychosis."
psychotic disorder,psychotic disorder symptoms,"According to the National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH)
, there are warning signs that may appear before psychosis develops. These can include:
a sudden drop in school work or job performance
trouble thinking clearly
difficulty concentrating
feeling paranoid or suspicious of others
withdrawing from friends and loved ones
an influx of strange, new feelings, or no feeling at all
a disinterest in personal grooming
difficulty separating reality from non-reality
trouble communicating
If someone is experiencing an episode of psychosis, the main symptoms
include:
hallucinations
delusions
disorganized behavior (behavior that does not seem to make sense, or that is impulsive)
negative symptoms (seemingly having no emotion, lack of interest in activities previously enjoyed, an ungroomed appearance, etc.)
catatonia (a �frozen� appearance)
Suicide prevention
Call 911 or your local emergency number.
Stay with the person until help arrives.
Remove any guns, knives, medications, or other things that may cause harm.
Listen, but don�t judge, argue, threaten, or yell.
Get help from a crisis or suicide prevention hotline. Try the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255.

psychotic disorder,psychotic disorder causes,"Each case of psychosis is different, and the exact cause isn�t always clear. There are certain illnesses that cause psychosis. There are also triggers like drug use, lack of sleep, and other environmental factors. In addition, certain situations can lead to specific types of psychosis developing.
In general, some of the factors involved in psychosis are:
genetics
trauma (such as a death, sexual assault, or living through a war)
substance use (drugs like LSD and amphetamines have been linked
to instances of psychosis in some people)
mental health conditions (like schizophrenia)"
psychotic disorder,psychotic disorder risks,"It�s not currently possible to precisely identify who is likely to develop psychosis. However, research has shown that genetics may play a role.
People are more likely to develop a psychotic disorder if they have a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, who has a psychotic disorder.
Children born with the genetic mutation known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are at risk of developing a psychotic disorder, especially schizophrenia."
psychotic disorder,psychotic disorder diagnosis,"Psychosis is diagnosed through a psychiatric evaluation. That means a doctor will watch the person�s behavior and ask questions about what they�re experiencing.
Medical tests and X-rays may be used to determine whether there is an underlying illness causing the symptoms.
Diagnosing psychosis in children and teenagers
Many of the symptoms of psychosis in adults aren�t symptoms of psychosis in young people. For example, small children often have imaginary friends with whom they talk. This just represents imaginative play, which is completely normal for children.
But if you�re worried about psychosis in a child or adolescent, it�s best to describe their behavior to a doctor."
psychotic disorder,psychotic disorder treatment,"Treating psychosis may involve a combination of medications and therapy. Most people will experience an improvement in their symptoms with treatment.
Rapid tranquilization
Sometimes people experiencing psychosis can become agitated and be at risk of hurting themselves or others. In these cases, it may be necessary to calm them down quickly.
This method is called rapid tranquilization
. A doctor or emergency response personnel will administer a fast-acting injection or liquid medication to quickly relax the person.
Medication
Symptoms of psychosis can be managed with medications called antipsychotics. They reduce hallucinations and delusions, and help people think more clearly. The type of antipsychotic a doctor prescribes will depend on the symptoms.
In many cases, people only need to take antipsychotics for a short time until their symptoms are more manageable. Others may need to take them more long term.
Cognitive behavioral therapy
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of mental health therapy. Its goal is to change thinking and behaviors. CBT involves regular meetings with a mental health counselor.
CBT has been shown to be effective in helping people better manage their mental health conditions.
It�s often most helpful for symptoms of psychosis that medications don�t fully address."
psychotic disorder,psychotic disorder complications,"Psychosis doesn�t have many medical complications. However, if left untreated, it can be challenging for people experiencing psychosis to maintain quality of life. This could cause other conditions to go untreated.
Most people who experience psychosis, even severe cases, will recover with the proper treatment, such as therapy and medication."
bipolar disorder,bipolar disorder definition,"Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition marked by large shifts in mood from mania to depression. Although bipolar disorder can be challenging to manage, many effective treatments and strategies are available.
Bipolar disorder isn�t a rare condition. In fact, the National Institute of Mental Health says that 2.8%
of U.S. adults � or about 5 million people � have a bipolar disorder diagnosis.
The condition used to be known as manic depression and bipolar disease.
Key symptoms of bipolar disorder include:
These episodes may last from a few days to several weeks or longer.
If you�re living with bipolar disorder, the following treatment options can help you learn to manage mood episodes, which can improve not only your symptoms but also your overall quality of life."
bipolar disorder,bipolar disorder symptoms,"To receive a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, you must experience at least one period of mania or hypomania.
These both involve feelings of excitement, impulsivity, and high energy, but hypomania is considered less severe than mania. Mania symptoms can affect your day-to-day life at work or home. Hypomania symptoms typically don�t cause as much disruption, but they can still be distressing.
Some people living with bipolar disorder also experience major depressive episodes or �down� moods.
These three main symptoms � mania, hypomania, and depression � are the main features of bipolar disorder. Different types of bipolar disorder involve different combinations of these symptoms.
Bipolar I symptoms
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5)
, a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder requires the following:
at least one episode of mania that lasts at least 1 week
symptoms that affect daily function
symptoms that don�t relate to another medical or mental health condition or substance use
You could also experience symptoms of psychosis or both mania and depression (known as mixed features). These symptoms can have more impact on your life. If you have them, it�s worth reaching out for professional support as soon as possible.
While you don�t need to experience episodes of hypomania or depression to receive a bipolar I diagnosis, many people with bipolar I do report these symptoms.
Bipolar II symptoms
A diagnosis of bipolar II requires:
at least one episode of hypomania that lasts 4 days or longer
and involves 3 or more symptoms of hypomania
hypomania-related changes in mood and usual function that others can notice, though these may not necessarily affect your daily life
at least one episode of major depression that lasts 2 weeks or longer
at least one episode of major depression involving five or more key depression symptoms that have a significant impact on your day-to-day life
symptoms that don�t relate to another medical or mental health condition or substance use
Bipolar II can also involve symptoms of psychosis, but only during an episode of depression. You could also experience mixed mood episodes, which means you�ll have symptoms of depression and hypomania simultaneously.
With bipolar II, though, you won�t experience mania. If you have a manic episode, you�ll receive a diagnosis of bipolar I.
Cyclothymia symptoms
A diagnosis of cyclothymia requires:
periods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depression symptoms, off and on, over 2 years or longer
(1 year
for children and adolescents)
symptoms that never meet the full criteria for an episode of hypomania or depression
symptoms that are present for at least half of the 2 years and never absent for longer than 2 months at a time
symptoms that don�t relate to another medical or mental health condition or substance use
symptoms that cause significant distress and affect daily life
Fluctuating mood symptoms characterize cyclothymia. These symptoms may be less severe than those of bipolar I or II. Still, they tend to last longer, so you�ll generally have less time when you experience no symptoms.
Hypomania may not have a big impact on your daily life. Depression, on the other hand, often leads to more serious distress and affects day-to-day function, even if your symptoms don�t qualify for a major depressive episode.
If you do experience enough symptoms to meet the criteria for a hypomanic or depressive episode, your diagnosis will likely change to another type of bipolar disorder or major depression, depending on your symptoms."
bipolar disorder,bipolar disorder symptoms,"Most research suggests that males and females receive bipolar disorder diagnoses roughly equally
, though some studies suggest it may be more prevalent in females. However, the main symptoms of the disorder may vary, depending on the sex you were assigned at birth and your gender.
Females with bipolar disorder tend to receive diagnoses later in life, often in their 20s or 30s. Sometimes, they might first notice symptoms during pregnancy or after childbirth. They�re also more likely to be diagnosed with bipolar II than bipolar I.
Additionally, females living with bipolar disorder tend to experience:
milder episodes of mania
more depressive episodes than manic episodes
rapid cycling, or four or more episodes
of mania and depression in 1 year
more co-occurring conditions
Females with bipolar disorder may also experience relapse more often, partly due to hormone changes related to menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause. In terms of bipolar disorder, relapse means having a mood episode after not having one for some time.
Get the facts about bipolar disorder in females.
Males with bipolar disorder, on the other hand, may:
get a diagnosis earlier in life
experience less frequent but more severe episodes, especially manic episodes
be more likely to also have a substance use disorder
show more aggression during episodes of mania"
bipolar disorder,bipolar disorder treatment,"Several treatments can help you manage bipolar disorder symptoms. These include
medications, counseling, and lifestyle measures. Some natural remedies can also have benefits.
Medications
Recommended medications may include:
mood stabilizers, such as lithium (Lithobid)
antipsychotics, such as olanzapine (Zyprexa)
antidepressant-antipsychotics, such as fluoxetine-olanzapine (Symbyax)
benzodiazepines, a type of anti-anxiety medication used for short-term treatment
Psychotherapy
Recommended therapy approaches may include:
Cognitive behavioral therapy
Cognitive behavioral therapy is a type of talk therapy that helps you identify and address unhelpful thoughts and change unwanted behavior patterns.
Therapy offers a safe space to discuss ways to manage your symptoms. Your therapist can also offer support with:
understanding thought patterns
reframing distressing emotions
learning and practicing more helpful coping strategies
Get tips on finding the right therapist.
Psychoeducation
Psychoeducation is a therapeutic approach centered around helping you learn about a condition and its treatment. This knowledge can go a long way toward helping you and the supportive people in your life recognize early mood symptoms and manage them more effectively.
Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy
Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy focuses on regulating daily habits, such as sleeping, eating, and exercising. Balancing these everyday basics could lead to fewer mood episodes and less severe symptoms.

Natural remedies for bipolar disorder
Some natural remedies might also help with bipolar disorder symptoms.
You�ll always want to check with your doctor or psychiatrist before trying these remedies, though. In some cases, they could interfere with any medications you�re taking.
The following herbs and supplements may help stabilize your mood and reduce symptoms of bipolar disorder when combined with medication and therapy:
Omega-3: Some 2016 research
suggests that taking an omega-3 supplement may help with symptoms of bipolar I. However, a 2021 study found weak support for using the supplement to treat depression symptoms in bipolar disorder.
Rhodiola rosea: A 2013 review
suggests this plant may help with moderate depression, so it could help treat depression associated with bipolar disorder, but this, too, has not been substantiated with newer research.
S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe): SAMe is an amino acid supplement that may help ease
symptoms of major depression and other mood disorders. However, it can induce mania and may interact with other medications.
You should consult with a doctor before trying SAMe or any other herbal or natural remedies to help you manage your bipolar symptoms.

Lifestyle changes
Some studies suggest that lifestyle measures can help reduce the severity
of your bipolar disorder symptoms. These can include the following:
eating a balanced diet
getting at least 150 minutes of exercise a week
managing your weight
getting weekly counseling or therapy
That said, the improvements reported by many of these studies were not significant
, indicating that lifestyle interventions alone may not be enough to manage the condition. They may work better when combined with other treatments."
bipolar disorder,bipolar disorder causes,"Bipolar disorder is a fairly common mental health condition, but experts have yet to determine why some people develop the condition.
Some potential causes of bipolar disorder include:
Genetics
If your parent or sibling has bipolar disorder, you�re more likely to develop the condition. The risk of developing bipolar disorder is 10% to 25%
if one of your parents has the condition.
Keep in mind, though, that most people who have a history of bipolar disorder in their family history don�t develop it.
Learn more about the hereditary aspect of bipolar disorder.
Your brain
Your brain structure may affect your risk of developing bipolar disorder. Irregularities in brain chemistry, or the structure or functions of your brain, may increase this risk.
Environmental factors
It�s not just what�s in your body that can affect your chances of developing bipolar disorder. Outside factors can also play a part. These might include:
extreme stress
traumatic experiences
physical illness
Learn more about the potential causes of bipolar disorder."
bipolar disorder,bipolar disorder prevention,"Once you begin to experience mood episodes, you can take steps to help reduce the severity of those episodes and lower your chances of experiencing additional mood episodes. But you can�t always prevent mood episodes entirely or keep the condition from developing in the first place.
Future research may reveal more about the specific causes of bipolar disorder and give researchers more insight into potential ways of preventing the condition."
obesity,obesity definition,"Obesity is a long-term (chronic) health condition that progresses over time. Obesity is defined by excess body fat (adipose tissue) that may impair health.
Body mass index (BMI) is a calculation that takes a person�s weight and height into account to measure body size. Doctors typically use it as a screening tool for obesity.
In adults, obesity is often defined as having a BMI of 30 or more
, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Obesity is associated with a higher risk of developing serious diseases, including:
While BMI tends to relate to the level of body fat, it has some limitations as a measurement.
According to the CDC
, �Factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, and muscle mass can influence the relationship between BMI and body fat. Also, BMI doesn�t distinguish between excess fat, muscle, or bone mass, nor does it provide any indication of the distribution of fat among individuals.�
Despite these limitations, BMI continues to be widely used as a way to measure body size. This is because it�s less expensive than other methods.
It�s worth noting that the effects of weight discrimination can also contribute to negative health effects.
Obesity is common. The CDC estimates that 41.9%
of people in the United States had obesity from 2017 to March 2020.
Keep reading to learn more about obesity causes, risk factors, and treatment.
You�ll notice that the language used to share stats and other data points is pretty binary, fluctuating between the use of �men� and �women.�
Although we typically avoid language like this, specificity is key when reporting on research participants and clinical findings.
Unfortunately, the studies and surveys referenced in this article didn�t report data on, or include, participants who were transgender, nonbinary, gender nonconforming, genderqueer, agender, or genderless."
obesity,obesity symptoms,"There are no specific symptoms associated with obesity. A doctor may diagnose obesity based on the following factors:
excess amounts of abdominal (visceral) fat that are higher than the amounts of body fat in other areas
a waist circumference of greater than 40 inches for men or 35 inches for women
a BMI over 30"
obesity,obesity causes,"Taking in more calories than you burn in daily activity and exercise � on a long-term basis � can lead to obesity. Over time, these extra calories add up and cause weight gain.
But it�s not always just about calories in and calories out or having a sedentary lifestyle. While those are indeed causes of obesity, some causes you can�t control.
Common specific causes of obesity include:
genetics, which can affect how your body processes food into energy and how fat is stored
growing older, which can lead to less muscle mass and a slower metabolic rate, making it easier to gain weight
not sleeping enough, which can lead to hormonal changes that make you feel hungrier and crave certain high calorie foods
high stress, which may trigger the production of hormones that cause you to eat more and store more fat
pregnancy, as weight gained during pregnancy may be difficult to lose and might eventually lead to obesity
Certain health conditions can also lead to weight gain, which may lead to obesity. These include:
metabolic syndrome, a group of risk factors that include high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high levels of triglycerides, low levels of HDL cholesterol, and excess fat around your waist that raise your chance of developing certain serious health conditions
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition that causes an imbalance of hormones called androgens
Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare condition present at birth that causes excessive hunger
Cushing syndrome, a condition caused by having high levels of cortisol (the stress hormone) in your system
hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn�t produce enough of certain important hormones
osteoarthritis (OA) and other conditions that cause pain that may lead to reduced activity

obesity,obesity risks,"A complex mix of factors can increase a person�s risk of obesity.
Genetics
Some people have genes that make it more likely for them to gain weight and body fat.
Environment and community
Your environment at home, at school, and in your community can all influence how and what you eat, as well as how active you are.
You may be at a higher risk of developing obesity if you:
live in a neighborhood with limited nutritious food options or with many
high calorie food options, like fast-food restaurants
haven�t learned to cook balanced meals
think you can�t afford more nutritious foods
haven�t found
a good place to play, walk, or exercise in your neighborhood
Psychological and other factors
Depression can sometimes lead to weight gain, as some people may turn to food for emotional comfort.
Having disturbed sleeping patterns can make you eat more
during the day, especially foods high in fat and carbohydrates.
If you smoke, quitting smoking is beneficial to your health, but quitting may lead to weight gain too. In some people, it may lead to excessive
weight gain. For that reason, it�s important to focus on diet and exercise while you�re quitting, at least after the initial withdrawal period.
Medications
Certain medications can also raise your risk of weight gain. These medications can include:
corticosteroids, which may treat autoimmune disease
antidepressants
antipsychotics
beta-blockers, which may treat high blood pressure"
obesity,obesity diagnosis,"BMI provides a rough calculation of a person�s weight in relation to their height.
Other more accurate measures of body fat and where body fat is located include:
skinfold thickness tests
waist-to-hip comparisons
dual energy radiographic absorptiometry (DEXA) scans
other screening tests, such as ultrasounds, CT scans, and MRI scans
A doctor may also order certain tests to help diagnose obesity-related health risks. These may include:
blood tests to examine cholesterol and glucose levels
liver function tests
diabetes screening
thyroid tests
heart tests, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)
A measurement of the fat around your waist is also a good predictor of your risk of developing obesity-related diseases."
obesity,obesity complications,"Obesity can lead to more than weight gain.
Having a high ratio of body fat to muscle puts strain on your bones as well as your internal organs. It also increases inflammation in the body, which may be a risk factor for cancer. Obesity is also a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes.
Researchers have linked obesity to many health complications, some of which can be life threatening if not treated:
type 2 diabetes
heart disease
high blood pressure
certain cancers (breast, colon, and endometrial)
stroke
gallbladder disease
fatty liver disease
high cholesterol
sleep apnea and other breathing problems
arthritis
infertility"
obesity,obesity prevention,"Due to a dramatic increase in obesity and obesity-related diseases, communities, states, and the federal government are putting an emphasis on healthier food choices and activities to help prevent obesity and treat people with overweight and obesity.
On a personal level, you can help prevent weight gain and obesity by:
getting regular moderate exercise like walking, swimming, or biking for 20 to 30 minutes every day
eating a balanced, heart-healthy diet composed of nutritious foods, like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein
eating high calorie foods and those high in saturated and trans fats in moderation"
ischemia,ischemia definition,"Ischemic stroke is one of three types of stroke. It is caused by a blockage in an artery that supplies blood to the brain. If circulation isn�t restored quickly, brain damage can be permanent.
Ischemic stroke is also called brain ischemia and cerebral ischemia. The blockage caused by this stroke reduces the blood flow and oxygen to the brain, leading to damage or death of brain cells. Approximately 87 percent of all strokes are ischemic strokes.
Another type of major stroke is hemorrhagic stroke, in which a blood vessel in the brain ruptures and causes bleeding. The bleeding compresses brain tissue, damaging or killing it.
The third type of stroke is transient ischemic attack (TIA), also known as a ministroke. This type of stroke is caused by a temporary blockage or decreased blood flow to the brain. Symptoms usually disappear on their own."
ischemia,ischemia symptoms,"Specific symptoms of an ischemic stroke depend on what region of the brain is affected. Certain symptoms are common across most ischemic stroke, including:
vision problems, such as blindness in one eye or double vision
weakness or paralysis in your limbs, which may be on one or both sides, depending on the affected artery
dizziness and vertigo
confusion
loss of coordination
drooping of face on one side
Once symptoms start, it�s crucial to get treatment as quickly as possible. This makes it less likely that damage becomes permanent. If you think someone is having a stroke, evaluate them using FAST:
Face. Is one side of their face drooping and hard to move?
Arms. If they raise their arms, does one arm drift downward, or do they have significant difficulty raising their arm?
Speech. Is their speech slurred or otherwise strange?
Time. If the answer to any of these questions is yes, it�s time to call your local emergency services.
Even though TIA lasts for a brief period and usually resolves on its own, it also requires a doctor. This can be a warning sign of a full-blown ischemic stroke."
ischemia,ischemia causes,"Ischemic stroke occurs when an artery that supplies blood to the brain is blocked by a blood clot or fatty buildup, called plaque. This blockage can appear at the neck or in the skull.
Clots usually start in the heart and travel through the circulatory system. A clot can break up on its own or become lodged in an artery. When it blocks a brain artery, the brain doesn�t get enough blood or oxygen, and cells start to die.
Ischemic stroke caused by a fatty buildup happens when plaque breaks off from an artery and travels to the brain. Plaque can also build up in the arteries that supply blood to the brain and narrow those arteries enough to cause ischemic stroke.
Global ischemia, which is a more severe type of ischemic stroke, happens when the flow of oxygen to the brain is greatly reduced or completely stopped. This is usually caused by a heart attack, but it can also be caused by other conditions or events, such as carbon monoxide poisoning."
ischemia,ischemia risks,"Circulatory conditions are the main risk factor for ischemic stroke. That�s because they increase your risk for clots or fatty deposits. These conditions include:
high blood pressure
atherosclerosis
high cholesterol
atrial fibrillation
prior heart attack
sickle cell anemia
clotting disorders
congenital heart defects
Other risk factors include:
diabetes
smoking
being overweight, especially if you have a lot of abdominal fat
heavy alcohol misuse
use of certain drugs, such as cocaine or methamphetamines
Ischemic stroke is also more common in people who have a family history of stroke or who�ve had past strokes. Men are more likely than women to have ischemic stroke, while blacks have a higher risk than other races or ethnic groups. Risk also increases with age."
ischemia,ischemia diagnosis,"A doctor can usually use a physical exam and family history to diagnose ischemic stroke. Based on your symptoms, they can also get an idea of where the blockage is located.
If you have symptoms such as confusion and slurred speech, your doctor might perform a blood sugar test. That�s because confusion and slurred speech are also symptoms of severe low blood sugar. Learn more about the effects of low blood sugar on the body.
A cranial CT scan can also help distinguish ischemic stroke from other issues that cause brain tissue death, such as a hemorrhage or a brain tumor.
Once your doctor has diagnosed ischemic stroke, they�ll try to figure out when it started and what the root cause is. An MRI is the best way determine when the ischemic stroke started. Tests used to determine a root cause might include:
an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) to test for abnormal heart rhythms
echocardiography to check your heart for clots or abnormalities
an angiography to see which arteries are blocked and how severe the blockage is
blood tests for cholesterol and clotting problems"
ischemia,ischemia complications,"If ischemic stroke isn�t treated promptly, it can lead to brain damage or death."
cirrhosis,cirrhosis definition,"Cirrhosis is the severe scarring or fibrosis of the liver. It happens in the late stage of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and other conditions that involve liver damage.
The scarring that occurs with cirrhosis is usually irreversible, but treatment can help manage it. Apart from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) other causes
include hepatitis, long-term alcohol use, and primary sclerosing cholangitis.
According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), about 1 in 400 adults
are living with cirrhosis in the United States. It�s more likely to affect men than women."
cirrhosis,cirrhosis symptoms,"Illustrated by Jason Hoffman
Many times, there aren�t noticeable symptoms of cirrhosis until the condition has progressed.
Symptoms begin to occur because scarring on the liver has reached the point where the organ is limited in its ability to:
purify the blood
break down toxins
produce clotting proteins
help with the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins
Some of the noticeable symptoms of cirrhosis include
:
decreased appetite
fatigue
unintentional weight loss
mild pain on the upper right side of your abdomen
nausea
vomiting
enlarged or swollen veins (varices or varicose veins)
More serious symptoms include:
yellow discoloration of your skin and eyes (jaundice)
confusion and difficulty thinking clearly
bruising or bleeding easily
very itchy skin
urine that looks darker than usual
abdominal swelling (ascites)
swelling of your legs (edema)
The stages of cirrhosis
Symptoms of cirrhosis fall into two technical stages: compensated cirrhosis and decompensated cirrhosis.
If caught early enough and treated, it�s possible to reverse from the decompensated to compensated stage.
Compensated cirrhosis. This is the asymptomatic (showing no symptoms) stage. There may still be scarring on the liver, but it has not progressed enough to cause many, or any, symptoms.
Decompensated cirrhosis. This is the stage where most of the symptoms like jaundice or ascites occur. This is a very serious stage. In some situations, if you�re able to manage the reason cirrhosis started in the first place (e.g., heavy drinking), you may be able to reverse your diagnosis back to compensated."
cirrhosis,cirrhosis causes,"There are many different causes of liver cirrhosis. Two of the most common causes of cirrhosis in the United States are chronic hepatitis infections and chronic alcohol misuse.
Alcohol
According to a meta-analysis of studies from 2019
, the risk of liver cirrhosis increases at any level of alcohol consumption for women, which means even a moderate drinker may be at some risk. For men, the risk of cirrhosis increases when an individual has more than one drink a day.
However, every person is different, and enjoying a glass of wine with dinner most nights does not mean you�ll get cirrhosis of the liver. Usually, cirrhosis caused by alcohol is the result of regularly drinking in excess over the course of many years.
There are also several other health factors that play into the development of this condition.
Hepatitis
Hepatitis C is a viral infection that can lead to inflammation and damage to the liver. Individuals who are at risk of getting this type of viral hepatitis include those who:
use illegal injected drugs
engage in sex without a condom or other barrier method
are on kidney dialysis
Hepatitis B is another viral form of hepatitis, but it tends to be less common in the United States and more common
in:
Asia
Africa
South America
Eastern Europe
parts of the Middle East
If left untreated, both of these forms of hepatitis can cause cirrhosis of the liver.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition that causes fat to build up in the liver, but it�s not associated with heavy alcohol use.
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a more severe form of NAFLD, causes liver damage and inflammation in addition to fat buildup. If NASH is not managed, it can lead to cirrhosis.
Other causes
Other causes of cirrhosis include:
Hepatitis D. Hepatitis D is often seen in people who already have hepatitis B.
Autoimmune hepatitis. Autoimmune hepatitis causes inflammation that can lead to cirrhosis.
Damage to the bile ducts. These ducts function to drain bile. One example of a condition is primary biliary cholangitis.
Disorders that affect the body�s ability to handle iron and copper. Two examples are hemochromatosis and Wilson�s disease.
Medication. This includes prescription and over-the-counter drugs like acetaminophen, some antibiotics, and some antidepressants."
cirrhosis,cirrhosis diagnosis,"A diagnosis of cirrhosis begins with a detailed history and physical exam. Your doctor will take a complete medical history.
It�s important to be as honest as possible about long-term alcohol misuse, exposure to hepatitis C, family history of autoimmune diseases, or other risk factors.
The physical exam will look for signs such as:
skin or eyes that appear more yellowed in color
reddened palms
hand tremors
an enlarged liver or spleen
decreased alertness
Tests can reveal how damaged the liver has become. Some of the tests used for evaluation of cirrhosis are:
a complete blood count to look for anemia
coagulation blood tests to see how quickly blood clots
albumin tests to check for a protein produced in the liver
liver function tests
alpha fetoprotein, a liver cancer screening
Additional tests that can evaluate the liver include:
an upper endoscopy to see if esophageal varices are present
an ultrasound scan of the liver
an MRI of the abdomen
a CT scan of the abdomen
a liver biopsy, which is the most conclusive test for cirrhosis"
cirrhosis,cirrhosis complications,"If your blood is unable to pass through your liver, it creates a backup through other veins such as those in the esophagus. This backup is called esophageal varices.
These veins are not built to handle high pressure and begin to bulge from the extra blood flow.
Other complications from cirrhosis include:
bacterial infections, like a urinary tract infection (UTI)
bleeding due to decreased clotting proteins
sensitivity to medications (the liver processes medications in the body)
malnutrition
kidney failure
liver cancer
hepatic encephalopathy, which is confusion due to the effects of blood toxins on the brain
gallstones (interference with bile flow can cause bile to harden and form stones)
splenomegaly, which is an enlarged spleen"
cirrhosis,cirrhosis treatment,"Treatment for cirrhosis varies based on what caused it, what symptoms you are experiencing, and how far the disorder has progressed. Treatments include medications, lifestyle changes, and surgery.
Medications
Depending on the cause of cirrhosis, your doctor may recommend certain medications, such as beta-blockers or nitrates (for portal hypertension). They may also recommend antibiotics or medications to treat hepatitis.
Lifestyle changes
If your cirrhosis is a result of alcohol consumption, your doctor will most likely advise you to stop drinking.
They may also recommend that you lose weight if they consider it medically necessary.
If you are dealing with ascites, a low sodium diet may also be recommended.
Surgery
If cirrhosis has progressed to the point where treatment isn�t enough, one of the last options is a liver transplant."
cirrhosis,cirrhosis prevention,"Practicing sex with a barrier method can reduce the risk of getting hepatitis B or C.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
recommends that all infants and at-risk adults, such as healthcare professionals and rescue personnel, be vaccinated against hepatitis B.
Limiting alcohol intake or avoiding alcohol, eating a balanced diet, and getting adequate exercise can help prevent or slow cirrhosis. Other prevention methods include:
avoiding illegal drugs
talking with your doctor about any medications you take and always taking the appropriate amount
getting screened for heptitis if you believe you may be at risk for it

benign prostatic hypertrophy,benign prostatic hypertrophy causes,"BPH is considered a normal condition of aging. Although the exact cause is unknown, changes in male sex hormones that come with aging may be a factor.
Any family history of prostate problems or any abnormalities with your testicles may raise your risk for BPH. Men who�ve had their testicles removed at a young age don�t develop BPH."
benign prostatic hypertrophy,benign prostatic hypertrophy symptoms,"The symptoms of BPH are often very mild at first, but they become more serious if they aren�t treated. Common symptoms include:
incomplete bladder emptying
nocturia, which is the need to urinate two or more times per night
dribbling at the end of your urinary stream
incontinence, or leakage of urine
straining when urinating
a weak urinary stream
a sudden urge to urinate
a slowed or delayed urinary stream
painful urination
blood in the urine
Talk with your doctor if you have any of these symptoms. They�re treatable, and treating them often can help prevent complications."
benign prostatic hypertrophy,benign prostatic hypertrophy diagnosis,"When checking you for BPH, your doctor will usually begin by doing a physical exam and asking you about your medical history. The physical exam includes a rectal examination that allows the doctor to estimate the size and shape of your prostate. Other tests can include:
Urinalysis. Your urine is checked for blood and bacteria.
Urodynamic test. Your bladder is filled with liquid via a catheter to measure your bladder�s pressure during urination.
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. This blood test checks for cancer of the prostate.
Post-void residual. This tests the amount of urine left in your bladder after urination.
Cystoscopy. This is the examination of your urethra and bladder with a tiny lighted scope that�s inserted into your urethra
Your doctor may also ask about medications you�re taking that might be affecting your urinary system, such as:
antidepressants
diuretics
antihistamines
sedatives
Your doctor can make any necessary medication adjustments. Don�t attempt to adjust your medications or doses yourself.
Let your doctor know if you�ve taken self-care measures for your symptoms for at least 2 months without noticing any improvement."
benign prostatic hypertrophy,benign prostatic hypertrophy treatment,"Treatment of BPH can begin with self-care and lifestyle adjustments. If symptoms don�t subside, medication or surgery may be recommended. Your age and general health will also influence the prescribed treatment.
Learn more about BPH treatment."
benign prostatic hypertrophy,benign prostatic hypertrophy treatment,"Natural treatment can include specific actions or lifestyle changes that you can make to help relieve your symptoms of BPH. These include:
urinating as soon as you feel the urge
going to the bathroom to urinate, even when you don�t feel the urge
avoiding over-the-counter decongestants or antihistamine medications, which can make it harder for the bladder to empty
avoiding alcohol and caffeine, especially in the hours after dinner
reducing your stress level, as nervousness can increase the frequency of urination
exercising regularly, as a lack of exercise can aggravate your symptoms
learning and practicing Kegel exercises to strengthen your pelvic muscles
keeping warm, since being cold can make symptoms worse
Some people also include natural remedies in their treatment of BPH. However, there isn�t evidence that they�re effective.
Learn more about BPH natural remedies."
benign prostatic hypertrophy,benign prostatic hypertrophy complications,"The symptoms of BPH can be easy to ignore. However, early treatment can help you avoid potentially dangerous complications. Call your doctor if you�re noticing symptoms of BPH.
People with a long-standing history of BPH may develop the following complications:
urinary tract infections
urinary stones
kidney damage
bleeding in the urinary tract
a sudden inability to urinate
Sometimes, urinary obstruction from BPH is so severe that no urine can leave the bladder at all. This is called bladder outlet obstruction. It can be dangerous because urine trapped in the bladder can cause urinary tract infections and damage your kidneys."
arthritis,arthritis definition,"Arthritis is an inflammation of the joints that may affect one joint or multiple joints. The symptoms of arthritis usually develop over time, but they may also appear suddenly.
There are more than
100 different types of arthritis, with different causes and treatment methods.
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis
in the United States. Other common types
include:
The typical age for developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is between ages 30 and 50. It can, however, affect children, teens, and younger adults.
Osteoarthritis (OA) commonly develops after the age 50 or 60 years, but there are studies that reveal radiographic evidence of OA occurring in women in their 40s. It also tends to be more prevalent in individuals who are overweight.
Join others who understand what you�re going through, and discover a safe space for community, guidance, and support to manage PsA symptoms together."
arthritis,arthritis symptoms,"Joint pain, stiffness, and swelling are the most common symptoms
of arthritis. Your symptoms may also feel worse in the morning when you get out of bed or upon standing up after you�ve been resting.
Other symptoms of osteoarthritis include:
limited range of motion that sometimes goes away after movement
clicking or popping with bending
muscle weakness around the joint
instability or buckling of the joint
bony growths in the fingers
grating or scraping feeling in the knees
Other symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis include:
morning stiffness that can last 30 minutes or more
more than one affected joint
onset in smaller joints like feet and hands
same joints on both sides of the body are affected
fatigue
low-grade fever
inflammation of the eyes and mouth
inflammation of the heart muscle and blood vessels
low red blood cell count"
arthritis,arthritis causes,"Arthritis may be caused by
:
wear and tear of a joint from overuse
age (OA is most common in adults over age 50)
injuries
obesity
autoimmune disorders
genes or family history
muscle weakness
Osteoarthritis
Normal wear and tear causes OA, one of the most common forms of arthritis. An infection or injury to the joints can exacerbate this natural breakdown of cartilage tissue.
Cartilage is a firm but flexible connective tissue in your joints. It protects the joints by absorbing the pressure and shock created when you move and put stress on them. A reduction in the normal amount of this cartilage tissue causes some forms of arthritis.
Your risk of developing OA may
also be higher if you have a family history of the disease.
Rheumatoid arthritis
Another common form of arthritis, RA, is an autoimmune disorder. It occurs when your body�s immune system attacks the tissues of the body, resulting in inflammation to joints as well as other body organs.
In the joints, this inflammatory response affects the synovium, a soft tissue in your joints that produces a fluid that nourishes the cartilage and lubricates the joints, eventually destroying both bone and cartilage inside the joint.
The exact cause of the immune system�s attacks is unknown. But scientists have discovered genetic markers that increase your risk of developing RA fivefold."
arthritis,arthritis diagnosis,"Seeing your primary care physician is a good first step if you�re unsure who to see for an arthritis diagnosis. They will perform a physical exam to check for fluid around the joints, warm or red joints, and document the range of motion in the joints. Your doctor can refer you to a specialist if needed.
If you�re experiencing severe symptoms, you may choose to schedule an appointment with a rheumatologist first. This may lead to a faster diagnosis and treatment.
Documenting inflammation levels in your blood and aspirating and analyzing joint fluids, if present, can help your doctor determine what kind of arthritis you have.
Blood tests that check for specific types of antibodies like anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), rheumatoid factor (RF) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) are also common diagnostic tests.
Doctors commonly use imaging scans such as X-ray, MRI, and CT scans to produce an image of your bones and cartilage. This helps them rule out other causes of your symptoms, such as bone spurs.

arthritis,arthritis complications,"When left untreated, symptoms of arthritis may worsen and affect your day-to-day life. Below are some of the possible complications associated with this condition:
Reduced mobility. As arthritis progresses, you may experience less comfortable movement. This can interfere with your daily routine and may keep you from your favorite activities as well as socializing.
Possible weight gain. This is attributed to decreased movements, as well as discomfort that keeps you from exercising.
Increased risk of metabolic disorders. Being overweight with an inflammatory condition like arthritis may increase your chances of developing type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and heart disease.
Inflammation in other areas of your body. If your arthritis is attributed to an autoimmune disease like with RA, the inflammation can spread and affect your skin, eyes, blood vessels, and lungs.
Risk of falls. According to the Arthritis Foundation, people with OA are more likely to experience falls and possible fractures. This is primarily caused by related muscle weakness, but dizziness from pain medications can also lead to falls.
Decreased ability to work. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that about 60 percent
of people with arthritis are working age. Arthritis may affect your ability to move around in the workplace or even get from your mode of transportation to your job site.
Effects on mental health. Arthritis may increase the risk of anxiety and depression due to ongoing pain, inflammation, and social isolation.

arthritis,arthritis risks,"The overall risk factors for arthritis
include:
Obesity. Particularly associated with OA, being overweight puts added stress on weight-bearing joints in the body, such as your knees and hips. Losing excess weight can help reduce your risk of developing arthritis, and it may also help if you already have the condition.
Age and gender. The risk of developing arthritis increases with age. Also, women are more likely
than men to develop most forms of arthritis. The exception is gout, which is more prominent in men.
Overuse injuries. Repetitive stress injuries incurred during exercise, your job, or other activities may increase your risk of developing OA in the affected joint(s) later in life.
Your genes. A family history of autoimmune diseases as well as certain inherited genes may increase your risk of RA and other related types of arthritis.
Smoking. Your risk of developing RA may increase if you smoke
, and smoking can in turn make this autoimmune disease worse."
osteoporosis,osteoporosis definition,"Overview
Bone in your body constantly breaks down, and new bone replaces it. Osteoporosis is a condition in which bones break down faster than they can be replaced, making them less dense and more porous. This brittleness weakens bones and makes them more susceptible to fractures and breaks.
Osteoporosis can have a big impact on your quality of life. Lifestyle disruptions range from pain to depression to long-term home care.
People who have osteoporosis or are likely to develop it should be aware of potential complications of the disease and seek solutions before issues arise."
osteoporosis,osteoporosis symptoms,"There are no obvious signs of osteoporosis. Often, people don�t realize they have it until they experience a bump or fall that causes a bone to break. Some people will experience a loss of height over time or a stooped posture as a result of a broken vertebrae and curvature of the spine."
osteoporosis,osteoporosis complications,"In addition to making you more susceptible to breaks and fractures, osteoporosis can lead to other complications:
Limited mobility
Osteoporosis can be disabling and limit your physical activity. A loss of activity can cause you to gain weight. It can also increase stress on your bones, in particular your knees and hips. Gaining weight can also increase your risk of other problems, such as heart disease and diabetes.
Depression
Less physical activity can lead to a loss of independence and isolation. Activities you once enjoyed may be too painful now. This loss, added to the possible fear of fractures, can bring on depression. A poor emotional state can further hinder your ability to manage health issues. A positive, forward-thinking outlook is helpful when approaching any medical issue.
Pain
Fractures caused by osteoporosis can be severely painful and debilitating. Fractures of the spine can result in:
a loss of height
a stooping posture
persistent back and neck pain
Hospital admission
Some people with osteoporosis can break a bone and not notice it. However, most broken bones need hospital care. Surgery is often needed for this procedure, which may require an extended hospital stay and additional medical costs.
Nursing home care
Many times, a hip fracture will require long-term care in a nursing home. If a person is bedridden while receiving long-term care, there�s a higher likelihood, they may experience:
cardiovascular complications
more exposure to infectious diseases
an increased susceptibility to various other complications
Talk to your healthcare provider for more information about these potential risk factors. They can also help you create both a treatment and management plan if and when necessary."
osteoporosis,osteoporosis causes,"The following are some factors that put you at a higher risk of developing osteoporosis:
Age: Typically, the older you get, the more at risk you are.
Gender: Women, especially women in menopause, are more likely to get osteoporosis than men, as low estrogen levels lead to weak bones.
Genetics: Osteoporosis can be inherited.
Body type: People with a small, slender build are more likely to develop it.
Medications: Medications such as steroids have been linked to osteoporosis, according to the Mayo Clinic.
Thyroid problems: Some have been linked to osteoporosis.
Low vitamin D and calcium levels: Low levels can lead to bone loss.
Lack of exercise or long-term bed rest: Both situations can weaken bones.
Tobacco and alcohol: They can weaken bones as well."
osteoporosis,osteoporosis treatment,"There isn�t a cure for osteoporosis. However, treatment is available to help slow the progression of the disease and manage symptoms. Bones need calcium to stay strong and healthy. Not getting enough calcium early on in life can lead to osteoporosis later on.
Additionally, vitamin D can help your body absorb calcium. Be sure to check with your doctor about adding any supplements to your diet.
A moderate amount of exercise can help your bones and body stay strong. Falls account for a large number of bone fractures, so practices such as yoga, tai chi, or any other balance-training exercises can help you have better balance to avoid falls and fractures.
Medications can also help with osteoporosis. Antiresorptive medications slow the rate of bone loss. Anabolic medications promote bone growth.
For women in menopause, estrogen therapy can help prevent bone loss and strengthen bones. For women in post-menopause, bisphosphonates are the preferred treatment for osteoporosis.
Other prevention methods involve improving eyesight and using a cane or walker when walking to prevent slipping and falling."
pancreatitis,pancreatitis definition,Acute pancreatitis can occur due to infection or another health condition. You may experience symptoms that include pain within minutes of eating and pain that spreads to your left shoulder.
pancreatitis,pancreatitis causes,"Acute pancreatitis is caused directly or indirectly. Direct causes affect the pancreas itself, its tissues, or its ducts. Indirect causes result from diseases or conditions that originate somewhere else in your body.
Gallstones are one of the major causes of acute pancreatitis. Gallstones can lodge in the common bile duct and block the pancreatic duct. This impairs fluid from flowing to and from the pancreas and causes damage.
Direct causes
Other direct causes of acute pancreatitis include:
sudden immune system attacks on the pancreas, or autoimmune pancreatitis
pancreatic or gallbladder damage from surgery or injury
excessive fats called triglycerides in your blood
Indirect causes
Indirect causes of acute pancreatitis include:
alcohol abuse
cystic fibrosis, a serious condition that affects your lungs, liver, and pancreas
Kawasaki disease, a disease that occurs in children younger than 5 years old
viral infections like mumps and bacterial infections like mycoplasma
Reye�s syndrome, a complication from certain viruses that can also affect the liver
certain medications containing estrogen, corticosteroids, or certain antibiotics"
pancreatitis,pancreatitis risks,"Drinking too much alcohol can put you at risk for pancreatic inflammation. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) defines �too much� as more than one drink a day for women and a maximum of two drinks a day for men. Men are more at risk than women for developing alcohol-related pancreatitis.
Smoking tobacco also increases your chance of AP. Smoking and drinking rates are similar in black and white Americans, but black Americans are more than two times as likely to develop AP. A family history of cancer, inflammation, or another pancreatic condition also puts you at risk."
pancreatitis,pancreatitis symptoms,The predominant symptom of acute pancreatitis is abdominal pain.
pancreatitis,pancreatitis diagnosis,"Your doctor can diagnose AP by using blood tests and scans. The blood test looks for enzymes (amylase and lipase) leaking from the pancreas. An ultrasound, CT, or MRI scan allows your doctor to see any abnormalities in or around your pancreas. Your doctor will also ask about your medical history and ask you to describe your discomfort."
pancreatitis,pancreatitis complications,"Acute pancreatitis can cause pseudocysts in your pancreas. These fluid-filled sacks can lead to infections and even internal bleeding. Acute pancreatitis can also disrupt the balance of your body chemistry. This can lead to more complications.
You might also face the possibility of diabetes or kidney issues that lead to dialysis. Or malnutrition, if your acute pancreatitis is severe, or if you develop chronic pancreatitis over time.
In some people, acute pancreatitis can be the first sign of pancreatic cancer. Talk to your doctor about treatment as soon as you�re diagnosed with acute pancreatitis to avoid complications. Quick and effective treatment reduces your risk of complications significantly."
incontinence,incontinence definition,"Stress incontinence is the inability to control your urge to urinate in certain circumstances. It�s a serious and embarrassing disorder and can lead to social isolation.
Any pressure placed on the abdomen and bladder can lead to the loss of urine.
It�s important to remember that the term �stress� is used in a strictly physical sense when describing stress incontinence. It refers to excessive pressure on the bladder and not emotional stress.
An overactive bladder is a separate condition. In some cases, both overactive bladder and stress incontinence can occur, which is called mixed incontinence. Your doctor can do tests to determine which is causing your incontinence."
incontinence,incontinence symptoms,"The main symptom of stress incontinence is the loss of bladder control during physical activity. You may experience a few drops of urine or a large, involuntary flow. This can happen while you are:
laughing
sneezing
coughing
jumping
exercising
doing heavy lifting
engaging in sexual intercourse
Sometimes even standing up from a seated or reclining position can put additional pressure on your bladder and cause a leakage. Stress incontinence is unique for every individual. You may not show symptoms every time you participate in an activity, and the same activities that cause leakage for you may not affect another person with stress incontinence."
incontinence,incontinence treatment,"Treatment for stress incontinence varies according to the underlying cause of your problem. Your doctor will help you come up with a treatment plan using a combination of medications and lifestyle adjustments.
Behavioral therapy
You can change your lifestyle and the way you live to reduce episodes of stress incontinence. If you�re obese, your doctor may advise you to lose weight. You might also try to avoid activities that cause leakage, such as jumping or jogging.
Nicotine can irritate your bladder and may contribute to incontinence. If you�re a smoker, you should quit. The constant cough seen in smokers also contributes to the problem. Also, consider avoiding caffeine and alcohol, because these substances are bladder irritants. You might want to cut back on your overall fluid intake to reduce bladder pressure.
Pelvic muscle training
For many women, pelvic muscle training can help treat stress incontinence. Kegel exercises make your sphincter and pelvic muscles stronger. To perform a Kegel, contract the muscles you use to stop a stream of urine. It can be helpful to practice doing Kegels while sitting on the toilet to help you learn which muscles to use. Once you have mastered the exercise, you can perform them anywhere and at any time.
Electrical stimulation is another treatment, and it sends a mild electrical current through your pelvic floor muscles. The current makes your muscles contract, mimicking a Kegel exercise. You may be able to contract the muscles yourself after feeling exactly which muscles are contracting.
Medication
There are currently no FDA-approved medications to treat stress incontinence. Both oral and topical estrogen supplements may help in women. Sometimes, pseudoephedrine is used with success. The FDA is evaluating Cymbalta, an antidepressant, which seems to show promise in treating stress incontinence.
Surgery
If you have a severe case of stress incontinence, to the point that it interferes with your everyday life, your doctor may recommend surgery. Several types of procedures are available and include vaginal repairs and other procedures to lift the bladder and urethra. These surgeries are being perfected on an ongoing basis and a qualified surgeon can explain your many options.
During the surgery, doctors will try to provide your urethra and bladder with more support. A sling procedure uses your own tissues to create a support structure for the urethra. The Mayo Clinic states that slings are used more often in women than in men.
Your urologist, a doctor who specializes in the urinary tract, may also choose to inject collagen directly into the supportive tissues of your urethra. This strengthens the sphincter muscle by increasing pressure on the urethra. Collagen injections are the least invasive surgical procedure to treat stress incontinence."
hernia,hernia definition,"Hernias typically result from a combination of muscle weakness and strain. Doctors may suggest watchful waiting for complications or surgery to repair the hernia, depending on severity."
hernia,hernia symptoms,"The most common symptom of a hernia is a bulge or lump in the affected area. For example, in the case of an inguinal hernia, you may notice a lump on either side of your pubic bone where your groin and thigh meet.
You may find that the lump �disappears� when you�re lying down. You�re more likely to feel your hernia through touch when you�re standing up, bending down, or coughing. Discomfort or pain in the area around the lump may also be present.
Some types of hernia, such as hiatal hernias, can have more specific symptoms. These can include heartburn, trouble swallowing, and chest pain.
In many cases, hernias have no symptoms. You may not know you have a hernia unless it shows up while you�re undergoing a medical exam for an unrelated problem or a routine physical."
hernia,hernia causes,"Hernias are caused by a combination of muscle weakness and strain. Depending on its cause, a hernia can develop quickly or over a long period of time.
Some common causes of muscle weakness or strain that can lead to a hernia include:
a congenital condition, which occurs during development in the womb and is present from birth
aging
damage from an injury or surgery
strenuous exercise or lifting heavy weights
chronic coughing or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD)
pregnancy, especially having multiple pregnancies
constipation, which causes you to strain when having a bowel movement
being overweight or having obesity
ascites
There are also certain risk factors that make you more likely to develop a hernia. They include:
being born prematurely or having a low birth weight
being older
chronic cough (likely due to the repetitive increase in abdominal pressure)
cystic fibrosis
pregnancy
chronic constipation
being overweight or having obesity
smoking, which leads to the weakening of connective tissue
a personal or family history of hernias"
hernia,hernia treatment,"The only way to effectively treat a hernia is through surgical repair. Whether or not you need surgery depends on the size of your hernia and the severity of your symptoms.
Your doctor may want to simply monitor your hernia for possible complications. This approach is called watchful waiting.
In some cases, wearing a truss may help to ease the symptoms of a hernia. A truss is a supportive undergarment that helps to hold the hernia in place. Always see your doctor to make sure that a truss fits properly before using it.
If you have a hiatal hernia, over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications that reduce stomach acid can relieve your discomfort and improve symptoms. These include antacids, H2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors."
hernia,hernia diagnosis,"To diagnose your condition, your doctor will first perform a physical examination. During this examination, the doctor may feel for a bulge in your abdominal or groin area that gets larger when you stand, cough, or strain.
Your doctor will then take your medical history. They may ask you a variety of questions, including:
When did you first notice the bulge?
Have you experienced any other symptoms?
Do you think something in particular may have caused it to occur?
Tell me a little bit about your lifestyle. Does your occupation involve heavy lifting? Do you exercise rigorously? Do you lift weights professionally or recreationally? Do you have a history of smoking?
Do you have a personal or family history of hernias?
Have you had any surgeries in your abdominal or groin area?
Your doctor will also likely use imaging tests to aid in their diagnosis. These can include:
Abdominal ultrasound. Abdominal ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the structures inside the body.
Abdominal CT scan. Abdominal CT scan combines X-rays with computer technology to produce an image.
Abdominal MRI scan. Abdominal MRI scan uses a combination of strong magnets and radio waves to create an image.
If your doctor suspects a hiatal hernia, they may use other tests that allow them to assess the inside of your stomach:
X-rays of your digestive tract. A healthcare professional will have you drink a liquid containing diatrizoate meglumine/diatrizoate sodium (Gastrografin) or a liquid barium solution. These liquids help your digestive tract appear highlighted on X-ray images.
Endoscopy. During an endoscopy, a healthcare professional threads a small camera attached to a tube down your throat and into your esophagus and stomach.
If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here."
hernia,hernia complications,"Sometimes an untreated hernia can lead to potentially serious complications.
Your hernia may grow and cause more symptoms. It may also put too much pressure on nearby tissues, which can cause swelling and pain in the surrounding area.
A portion of your intestine could also become trapped in the abdominal wall. This is called incarceration. Incarceration can obstruct your bowel and cause severe pain, nausea, or constipation.
If the trapped section of your intestines doesn�t get enough blood flow, strangulation occurs. This can cause the intestinal tissue to become infected or die. A strangulated hernia is life threatening and requires immediate medical care.
Some symptoms that can signal that you need to seek out emergency medical attention for your hernia include:
a bulge that becomes red or purple
pain that suddenly gets worse
nausea
vomiting
fever
not being able to pass gas or have bowel movements"
hernia,hernia prevention,"You can�t always prevent a hernia from developing. Sometimes a hernia occurs because of an existing inherited condition or a previous surgery.
However, you can make some simple lifestyle adjustments to help lower your risk of a hernia. These steps aim to reduce the amount of strain you place on your body.
Here are a few general prevention tips:
If you smoke, consider quitting. You can work with your doctor to create a smoking cessation plan that�s right for you.
See a doctor when you�re sick to avoid developing a persistent cough.
Maintain a moderate body weight.
Try not to strain while having a bowel movement or during urination.
Eat enough high fiber foods to prevent constipation.
Perform exercises that help to strengthen the muscles of your abdomen.
Avoid lifting weights that are too heavy for you. If you must lift something heavy, bend at your knees and not your waist or back. Also avoid holding your breath when lifting heavy objects. Instead, exhale during the lift to decrease the chance of a hiatal hernia happening or worsening."
malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast,malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast definition,"Breast cancer occurs when breast cells develop mutations and begin to divide and multiply. People may first notice a lump in the breast, discoloration, texture changes, or other symptoms.
We will often use �men� and �women� in this article to reflect the terms that have been historically used to gender people. But your gender identity may not align with your breast cancer risk. Your doctor can help you better understand how your specific circumstances will translate into breast cancer risk factors and symptoms."
malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast,malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast symptoms,"In its early stages, breast cancer may not cause any symptoms. In many cases, a tumor may be too small to be felt, but an abnormality can still be seen on a mammogram.
If a tumor can be felt, the first sign is usually a new lump in the breast that was not there before. However, not all lumps are cancer.
Each type of breast cancer can cause a variety of symptoms. Many of these symptoms are similar, but some can be different. Symptoms for the most common breast cancers include:
a breast lump or tissue thickening that feels different from surrounding tissue and is new
breast pain
red or discolored, pitted skin on the breast
swelling in all or part of your breast
a nipple discharge other than breast milk
bloody discharge from your nipple
peeling, scaling, or flaking of skin on your nipple or breast
a sudden, unexplained change in the shape or size of your breast
inverted nipple
changes to the appearance of the skin on your breasts
a lump or swelling under your arm
If you have any of these symptoms, it doesn�t necessarily mean you have breast cancer. For instance, pain in your breast or a breast lump can be caused by a benign cyst.
Still, if you find a lump in your breast or have other symptoms, contact your doctor for further examination and testing.
Learn more about possible symptoms of breast cancer."
malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast,malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast diagnosis,"To determine if your symptoms are caused by breast cancer or a benign breast condition, your doctor will do a thorough physical exam in addition to a breast exam. They may also request one or more diagnostic tests to help understand what�s causing your symptoms.
Tests that can help your doctor diagnose breast cancer include:
Mammogram. The most common way to see below the surface of your breast is with an imaging test called a mammogram. Many women ages 40 and older get annual mammograms to check for breast cancer. If your doctor suspects you may have a tumor or suspicious spot, they will also request a mammogram. If an atypical area is seen on your mammogram, your doctor may request additional tests.
Ultrasound. A breast ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the tissues deep in your breast. An ultrasound can help your doctor distinguish between a solid mass, such as a tumor, and a benign cyst.
Your doctor may also suggest tests such as an MRI or a breast biopsy.
Learn about other tests that can be used to detect breast cancer.
If you don�t already have a primary care doctor, you can browse doctors in your area through the Healthline FindCare tool.
Breast biopsy
If your doctor suspects breast cancer based on tests like a mammogram or an ultrasound, they may do a test called a breast biopsy.
During this test, your doctor will remove a tissue sample from the suspicious area to have it tested.
There are several types of breast biopsies. With some of these tests, your doctor uses a needle to take the tissue sample. With others, they make an incision in your breast and then remove the sample.
Your doctor will send the tissue sample to a laboratory. If the sample tests positive for cancer, the lab can test it further to tell your doctor what type of cancer you have.
Learn more about breast biopsies, how to prepare for one, and what to expect."
malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast,malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast treatment,"Your breast cancer�s stage, how far it has invaded (if it has), and how big the tumor has grown all play a large part in determining what kind of treatment you�ll need.
To start, your doctor will determine your cancer�s size, stage, and grade. Your cancer�s grade describes how likely it is to grow and spread. After that, you can discuss your treatment options.
Surgery is the most common treatment for breast cancer. Many people have additional treatments, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiation, or hormone therapy.
Surgery
Several types of surgery may be used to remove breast cancer, including:
Lumpectomy. This procedure removes the tumor and some surrounding tissue, leaving the rest of the breast intact.
Mastectomy. In this procedure, a surgeon removes an entire breast. In a double mastectomy, they remove both breasts.
Sentinel node biopsy. This surgery removes a few of the lymph nodes that receive drainage from the tumor. These lymph nodes will be tested. If they don�t have cancer, you may not need additional surgery to remove more lymph nodes.
Axillary lymph node dissection. If lymph nodes removed during a sentinel node biopsy contain cancer cells, your doctor may remove additional lymph nodes.
Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. Even though breast cancer may be present in only one breast, some people elect to have a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. This surgery removes your healthy breast to lower your risk of developing breast cancer again.
Radiation therapy
With radiation therapy, high-powered beams of radiation are used to target and kill cancer cells. Most radiation treatments use external beam radiation. This technique uses a large machine on the outside of the body.
Advances in cancer treatment have also enabled doctors to irradiate cancer from inside the body. According to Breastcancer.org, this type of radiation treatment is called brachytherapy.
To conduct brachytherapy, surgeons place radioactive seeds, or pellets, inside the body near the tumor site. The seeds stay there for a short period of time and work to destroy cancer cells.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is a drug treatment used to destroy cancer cells. Some people may undergo chemotherapy on its own, but this type of treatment is often used along with other treatments, especially surgery.
Some people will have surgery first followed by other treatments, such as chemo or radiation. This is called adjuvant therapy. Others may have chemotherapy first to shrink the cancer, called neoadjuvant therapy, then surgery.
In some cases, doctors prefer to give chemotherapy before surgery. The hope is that the treatment will shrink the tumor, and then the surgery will not need to be as invasive.
Chemotherapy has many unwanted side effects, so discuss your concerns with your doctor before starting treatment.
Hormone therapy
If your type of breast cancer is sensitive to hormones, your doctor may start you on hormone therapy. Estrogen and progesterone, two female hormones, can stimulate the growth of breast cancer tumors.
Hormone therapy works by blocking your body�s production of these hormones or by blocking the hormone receptors on the cancer cells. This action can help slow and possibly stop the growth of your cancer.
Additional medications
Certain treatments are designed to attack specific irregularities or mutations within cancer cells.
For example, Herceptin (trastuzumab) can block your body�s production of the HER2 protein. HER2 helps breast cancer cells grow, so taking a medication to slow the production of this protein may help slow cancer growth.
Your doctor will tell you more about any specific treatment they recommend for you.
Learn more about breast cancer treatments, as well as how hormones affect cancer growth."
malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast,malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast risks,"There are several risk factors that increase your chances of getting breast cancer. However, having any of these doesn�t mean you will definitely develop the disease.
Some risk factors can�t be avoided, such as family history. You can change other risk factors, such as smoking. Risk factors for breast cancer include:
Age. Your risk of developing breast cancer increases as you age. Most invasive breast cancers are found in women over 55 years old.
Drinking alcohol. Alcohol use disorder raises your risk.
Having dense breast tissue. Dense breast tissue makes mammograms hard to read. It also increases your risk of breast cancer.
Gender. According to the ACS
, white women are 100 times more likely to develop breast cancer than white men, and Black women are 70 times more likely to develop breast cancer than Black men.
Genes. People who have the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations are more likely to develop breast cancer than people who don�t. Other gene mutations may also affect your risk.
Early menstruation. If you had your first period before you were 12 years old, you have an increased risk of breast cancer.
Giving birth at an older age. People who have their first child after 35 years old have an increased risk of breast cancer.
Hormone therapy. People who took or are taking postmenopausal estrogen and progesterone medications to help reduce their signs of menopause symptoms have a higher risk of breast cancer.
Inherited risk. If a close female relative has had breast cancer, you have an increased risk of developing it. This includes your mother, grandmother, sister, or daughter. If you don�t have a family history of breast cancer, you can still develop breast cancer. In fact, most people who develop it have no family history of the disease.
Late menopause start. People who start menopause after they�re 55 years old are more likely to develop breast cancer.
Never having been pregnant. People who have never become pregnant or carried a pregnancy to full term are more likely to develop breast cancer.
Previous breast cancer. If you have had breast cancer in one breast, you have an increased risk of developing breast cancer in your other breast or in a different area of the previously affected breast."
malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast,malignant neoplasm of breast or carcinoma breast prevention,"While there are risk factors you can�t control, following a healthy lifestyle, getting regular screenings, and taking any preventive measures your doctor recommends can help lower your risk of developing breast cancer.
Lifestyle factors
Lifestyle factors can affect your risk of breast cancer.
For instance, people who have obesity have a higher risk of developing breast cancer. Maintaining a nutrient-dense diet and getting regular exercise as often as possible could help you lose weight and lower your risk.
According to the American Association for Cancer Research, alcohol misuse also increases your risk. This can be having more than two drinks per day or binge-drinking.
If you drink alcohol, talk with your doctor about what amount they recommend for you.
Breast cancer screening
Having regular mammograms may not prevent breast cancer, but it can help reduce the chance that it will go undetected.
The American College of Physicians (ACP) provides the following general recommendations for women at average risk of breast cancer:
Women ages 40 to 49. An annual mammogram isn�t recommended, but discuss your preferences with your doctor.
Women ages 50 to 74. A mammogram every other year is recommended.
Women 75 years and older. Mammograms are no longer recommended.
The ACP also recommends against mammograms for women with a life expectancy of 10 years or less.
These are only guidelines.
Recommendations from the ACS
differ. According to the ACS, women should:
have the option of receiving annual screenings at 40 years old
begin annual screenings at 45 years old
move to screening every other year at 55 years old
Specific recommendations for mammograms are different for everyone, so talk with your doctor to see if you should get regular mammograms.
Preventive treatment
You may have an increased risk of breast cancer due to hereditary factors.
For instance, if your parent has a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation, you�re at higher risk of having it as well. This significantly raises your risk of breast cancer.
If you�re at risk for this mutation, talk with your doctor about your diagnostic and prophylactic treatment options. You may want to be tested to find out whether you have the mutation.
And if you learn that you do have it, talk with your doctor about any preemptive steps you can take to reduce your risk of developing breast cancer. These steps could include a prophylactic mastectomy, or surgical removal of a breast. You may also consider chemoprophylaxis, or taking medication, such as Tamoxifen, to potentially reduce your breast cancer risk.
In addition to mammograms, breast exams are another way to watch for signs of breast cancer.
Self-exams
Many people do a breast self-examination. It�s best to do this exam once per month, at the same time each month. The exam can help you become familiar with how your breasts usually look and feel so that you�re aware of any changes that occur.
Keep in mind, though, that the ACS
considers these exams to be optional, because current research hasn�t shown a clear benefit of physical exams, whether performed at home or by a doctor.
Breast exam by your doctor
The same guidelines for self-exams provided above are true for breast exams done by your doctor or other healthcare professional. They won�t hurt you, and your doctor may do a breast exam during your annual visit.
If you�re having symptoms that concern you, it�s a good idea to have your doctor do a breast exam. During the exam, your doctor will check both of your breasts for abnormal spots or signs of breast cancer.
Your doctor may also check other parts of your body to see if the symptoms you�re having could be related to another condition.
Learn more about what your doctor may look for during a breast exam."
diverticulitis,diverticulitis definition,Diverticulitis can cause digestive symptoms and abdominal pain. Some people may develop complications that require urgent medical care.
diverticulitis,diverticulitis symptoms,"Diverticulitis can cause symptoms ranging from mild to severe. These symptoms can appear suddenly, or they can develop gradually over several days.
Potential symptoms of diverticular disease include
:
pain in your abdomen
bloating
diarrhea
constipation
If you develop diverticulitis, you might experience:
constant or severe pain in your abdomen
nausea and vomiting
fever and chills
blood in your stool
bleeding from your rectum
Abdominal pain is the most common
symptom of diverticulitis. It will most likely occur in the lower left side of your abdomen. It can also develop in the right side of your abdomen.
If you develop any of the above symptoms, it may be a sign of a serious complication from diverticulitis or another condition. Call your doctor right away."
diverticulitis,diverticulitis causes,"Diverticular disease develops when pouches form along your digestive tract, typically in your colon (large intestine). These pouches (diverticula) can become inflamed and infected, which may occur when feces or partially digested food blocks the opening of the diverticula.
Although there�s no single known cause of diverticular disease, several factors can increase the risk of developing diverticulitis, including
:
genetics
diet
decreased immune function
having obesity
physical inactivity
smoking
changes in the gut microbiome
certain medications, such as steroids"
diverticulitis,diverticulitis complications,"More than 75 percent
of diverticulitis cases are uncomplicated, leaving about 25 percent to develop complications.
These complications can include:
abscess, an infected pocket that�s filled with pus
phlegmon, an infected area that�s less well-confined than an abscess
fistula, an abnormal connection that can develop between two organs or between an organ and the skin
intestinal perforation, a tear or hole in the intestinal wall that can allow the contents of your colon to leak into your abdominal cavity, causing inflammation and infection
intestinal obstruction, a blockage in your intestine that can stop stool from passing"
diverticulitis,diverticulitis diagnosis,"To diagnose diverticulitis, your doctor will likely ask about your symptoms, health history, and any medications you take. They�ll likely perform a physical exam to check your abdomen for tenderness.
If they need more information, they may perform a digital rectal exam to check for:
rectal bleeding
pain
masses
other problems
Several other conditions can cause symptoms that are similar to diverticulitis. To rule out other conditions and check for signs of diverticulitis, your doctor might order one or more tests.
Tests can include:
abdominal ultrasound, abdominal MRI scan, abdominal CT scan, or abdominal X-ray to create pictures of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract
colonoscopy to examine the inside of your GI tract; although this takes place after a bout of diverticulosis
stool test to check for infections, such as Clostridium difficile (C. diff)
urine test to check for infections
blood tests to check for signs of inflammation, anemia, or kidney or liver problems
pelvic exam to rule out gynecological problems in people assigned female at birth
pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy in people assigned female at birth
If you have diverticulitis, these exams and tests can help your doctor learn if it�s uncomplicated or complicated.
Using a colonoscopy to diagnose diverticulitis
If you have symptoms of diverticulitis, your doctor might
encourage you to have a colonoscopy once the acute episode resolves. This procedure can help confirm a diagnosis of diverticulitis or another condition that causes similar symptoms, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn�s disease.
During a colonoscopy, your doctor will thread a flexible scope into your rectum and colon. They can use this scope to examine the inside of your colon. They can also use it to collect tissue samples for testing.
To help you feel more comfortable during this procedure, you will be sedated beforehand.
In some cases, your doctor might learn that you have diverticula during a routine colonoscopy. If the diverticula aren�t inflamed, infected, or causing symptoms, you probably won�t need treatment."
diverticulitis,diverticulitis treatment,"The treatment that your doctor prescribes for diverticulitis will depend on how severe your condition is.
Uncomplicated diverticulitis can typically be treated at home. Your doctor might
encourage you to make changes to your diet. In some cases, they might prescribe medications, including antibiotics.
If you develop complications from diverticulitis, you may need
to visit a hospital for treatment. You may be given fluids and antibiotics through an intravenous (IV) line. Depending on the type of complication, you might need to undergo surgery or another procedure."
diverticulitis,diverticulitis prevention,"More research is needed to learn what causes diverticular disease, including diverticulitis. Currently, experts believe multiple factors play a part. Some potential risk factors may be modified through lifestyle changes.
For example, it might help
to:
try to maintain a moderate body weight
eat a diet that�s high in fiber to help bulk up stools (however, in acute diverticulitis, you may want to avoid fiber)
limit your consumption of saturated fat
get enough vitamin D
get regular exercise if possible
try to avoid cigarette smoke
These prevention strategies can also help promote good overall health."
diverticulitis,diverticulitis risks,"One of the main risk factors for diverticulitis is age. Older people are more likely than younger people to develop diverticulitis. It commonly occurs
in men under 50 and women ages 50 to 70.
People who develop diverticula at a younger age
may be more likely to experience diverticulitis. Younger people are also more likely
to be admitted to a hospital if they have diverticulitis than older people.
According to a review of research
published in 2018, other potential risk factors for diverticulitis include:
Family history
Studies have found that genetics play a role in diverticular disease, with some reports estimating that roughly 40 to 50 percent
of the potential risk of diverticular disease is hereditary.
Low levels of vitamin D
Some studies
suggest that people with higher levels of vitamin D might have a lower risk of getting diverticulitis. More research is needed to understand the potential link between vitamin D and diverticula.
Obesity
Several studies
have found that people with higher body mass index (BMI) and larger waists are at increased risk of diverticulitis.
It�s possible that obesity raises the risk of diverticulitis by changing the balance of bacteria in your gut, but more research is needed to understand the role this plays.
Physical inactivity
Some studies
have found that physically active people are less likely than inactive people to develop diverticulitis. However, this link still needs more research.
Using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or smoking
Regular use of aspirin, ibuprofen, or other NSAIDs may raise your risk of diverticulitis.
People who smoke are also more likely than nonsmokers to develop diverticular disease, including diverticulitis.
According to a 2017 review of research
, there�s no strong evidence that drinking alcohol raises your risk of this disease.
If you drink alcohol, your doctor will likely encourage you to drink in moderation only. Although alcohol consumption might not cause diverticulitis, drinking too much can raise your risk of many other health problems."
osteomyelitis,osteomyelitis definition,"What is a bone infection (osteomyelitis)?
A bone infection, also called osteomyelitis, can result when bacteria or fungi invade a bone.
In children, bone infections most commonly occur in the long bones of the arms and legs. In adults, they usually appear in the hips, spine, and feet.
Bone infections can happen suddenly or develop over a long period of time. If they�re not properly treated, bone infections can leave a bone permanently damaged."
osteomyelitis,osteomyelitis causes,"Many organisms, most commonly Staphylococcus aureus, travel through the bloodstream and can cause a bone infection. An infection may begin in one area of the body and spread to the bones via the blood stream.
Organisms that invade a severe injury, deep cut, or wound can also cause infections in nearby bones. Bacteria can enter your system at a surgical site, such as the site of a hip replacement or bone fracture repair. When your bone breaks, bacteria can invade the bone, leading to osteomyelitis.
The most common cause of bone infections is S. aureus bacteria. These bacteria commonly appear on the skin but don�t always cause health problems. However, the bacteria can overpower an immune system that�s weakened by disease and illness. These bacteria can also cause infections in injured areas."
osteomyelitis,osteomyelitis symptoms,"Usually, the first symptom to appear is pain at the infection site. Other common symptoms are:
fever and chills
redness in the infected area
irritability or generally feeling unwell
drainage from the area
swelling in the affected area
stiffness or inability to use an affected limb"
osteomyelitis,osteomyelitis diagnosis,"Your doctor may use several methods to diagnose your condition if you have any symptoms of a bone infection. They will perform a physical exam to check for swelling, pain, and discoloration. Your doctor may order lab and diagnostic tests to determine the exact location and extent of the infection.
It�s likely your doctor will order a blood test to check for the organisms causing the infection. Other tests to check for the bacteria are throat swabs, urine cultures, and stool analyses. The stool culture is an example of a stool analysis.
Another possible test is a bone scan, which reveals the cellular and metabolic activity in your bones. It uses a type of radioactive substance to highlight the bone tissue. If the bone scan doesn�t provide enough information, you may need an MRI scan. In some cases, a bone biopsy may be necessary.
However, a simple bone X-ray may be enough for your doctor to determine the treatment that�s right for you."
osteomyelitis,osteomyelitis treatment,"There are several options your doctor may use to treat your bone infection.
Antibiotics may be all that�s necessary to cure your bone infection. Your doctor may administer the antibiotics intravenously, or directly into your veins, if the infection is severe. You may need to take the antibiotics for up to six weeks.
Sometimes bone infections require surgery. If you have surgery, your surgeon will remove the infected bone and dead tissue and drain any abscesses, or pockets of pus.
If you have a prosthesis that�s causing the infection, your doctor may remove and replace it with a new one. Your doctor will also remove any dead tissue near or surrounding the infected area."
osteomyelitis,osteomyelitis risks,"There are a few conditions and circumstances that can increase your chances of osteomyelitis, such as:
diabetic disorders that affect blood supply to the bones
intravenous drug use
hemodialysis, which is a treatment used for kidney conditions
trauma to the tissue surrounding the bone
artificial joints or hardware that has become infected
sickle cell disease
peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
smoking"
osteomyelitis,osteomyelitis prevention,"Thoroughly wash and clean any cuts or open wounds in the skin. If a wound/cut does not look like it is healing with home treatment, contact your doctor immediately to have it examined. Clean and dry amputation sites before placing your prosthesis. Also, use the proper footwear and protective equipment to avoid injuries when jumping, running, or participating in sports."
bacteremia,bacteremia definition,"If you have bacteremia there are bacteria in your bloodstream. Often, there are no symptoms and the body fights off the bacteria. However, if the immune system cannot cope, it can lead to other serious conditions, such as sepsis.
Bacteremia is when there are bacteria present in your bloodstream. Another term that you may have heard for bacteremia is �blood poisoning,� however this isn�t a medical term.
In some cases, bacteremia can be asymptomatic, meaning there are no symptoms. In other cases, symptoms may be present and there�s a potential risk for serious complications.
Read on to learn more about bacteremia, its symptoms, and how it can be treated."
bacteremia,bacteremia causes,"A variety of different bacteria can cause bacteremia. Some of these bacteria can go on to establish an infection in the bloodstream.
Examples of such bacteria include:
Staphylococcus aureus, including MRSA
Escherichia coli (E. coli)
Pneumococcal bacteria
Group A Streptococcus
Salmonella species
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Some common ways in which bacteremia occurs include:
through a dental procedure such as a routine teeth cleaning or through a tooth extraction
from a surgery or procedure
an infection spreading from another part of the body into the bloodstream
via medical devices, particularly in-dwelling catheters and breathing tubes
through severe injuries or burns"
bacteremia,bacteremia symptoms,"Some cases of bacteremia are asymptomatic. In these cases, your immune system will often clear the bacteria without you knowing it.
When bacteremia results in a bloodstream infection, you�ll likely experience symptoms like:
fever
chills
shaking or shivering"
bacteremia,bacteremia diagnosis,"Bacteremia can be diagnosed using a blood culture. To do this, a sample of blood will be taken from a vein in your arm. It will then be sent to a lab to be tested for the presence of bacteria.
Depending on the presumed cause of your infection, your doctor may want to perform additional tests. Some examples include:
sputum culture if you appear to have a respiratory infection or are using a breathing tube
wound culture if you�ve been injured, burned, or have recently undergone surgery
taking samples from in-dwelling catheters or other devices
Imaging tests such as an X-ray, CT scan, or ultrasound may also be used. These can be used to identify potential sites of infection in the body."
bacteremia,bacteremia treatment,"The treatment for a bloodstream infection requires prompt use of antibiotics. This can help to prevent complications like sepsis from occurring. You�ll be hospitalized during treatment.
When bacteria are confirmed in your blood, you�ll likely be started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, typically via IV. This is an antibiotic regimen that should be effective against many different types of bacteria.
During this time, the type of bacteria causing your infection can be identified and antibiotic sensitivity testing can be completed.
With these results, your doctor may adjust your antibiotics to be more specific to what�s causing your infection.
The length of treatment can depend on the cause and severity of the infection. You may need to be on antibiotics for 1 to 2 weeks. IV fluids and other medications may also be given during treatment to help stabilize your condition."
bacteremia,bacteremia risks,"If a bloodstream infection is left untreated, you�re at risk of developing potentially life-threatening complications such as sepsis and septic shock.
Sepsis occurs due to a strong immune response to an infection. This response can trigger changes in your body such as inflammation. These changes can be harmful and can lead to organ damage.
When septic shock occurs, your blood pressure drops dramatically. Organ failure may also occur.
Symptoms of sepsis and septic shock
If a bloodstream infection progresses to sepsis or septic shock, you may also experience more severe symptoms, such as:
quick breathing
rapid heart rate
skin that�s sweaty or feels clammy
a decrease in urination
low blood pressure
changes in mental state, such as feeling confused or disoriented
Risk factors for sepsis and septic shock
Some groups are more at risk for developing sepsis or septic shock from a bloodstream infection. These groups include:
children younger than 1 year old
adults older than 65 years old
people with weakened immune systems
individuals with underlying health conditions like diabetes, kidney disease, or cancer
those that are already very sick or hospitalized
Other potential complications
In addition to sepsis and septic shock, bacteremia can cause other complications to occur. This can happen when the bacteria in your bloodstream travel to other areas of your body.
Additional complications can include:
Meningitis: An inflammation of the tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord.
Pneumonia: A potentially serious respiratory infection.
Endocarditis: An inflammation of the inner lining of the heart.
Osteomyelitis: A bone infection.
Infectious arthritis: An infection that occurs in a joint.
Cellulitis: An infection of the skin.
Peritonitis: An inflammation of the tissue surrounding your abdomen and organs."
sickle cell anemia,sickle cell anemia definition,"What is sickle cell anemia?
Sickle cell anemia, or sickle cell disease (SCD), is a genetic disease of the red blood cells (RBCs). Normally, RBCs are shaped like discs, which gives them the flexibility to travel through even the smallest blood vessels. However, with this disease, the RBCs have an abnormal crescent shape resembling a sickle. This makes them sticky and rigid and prone to getting trapped in small vessels, which blocks blood from reaching different parts of the body. This can cause pain and tissue damage.
SCD is an autosomal recessive condition. You need two copies of the gene to have the disease. If you have only one copy of the gene, you are said to have sickle cell trait."
sickle cell anemia,sickle cell anemia symptoms,"Symptoms of sickle cell anemia usually show up at a young age. They may appear in babies as early as 4 months old, but generally occur around the 6-month mark.
While there are multiple types of SCD, they all have similar symptoms, which vary in severity. These include:
excessive fatigue or irritability, from anemia
fussiness, in babies
bedwetting, from associated kidney problems
jaundice, which is yellowing of the eyes and skin
swelling and pain in hands and feet
frequent infections
pain in the chest, back, arms, or legs"
sickle cell anemia,sickle cell anemia risks,"Children are only at risk for sickle cell disease if both parents carry sickle cell trait. A blood test called a hemoglobin electrophoresis can also determine which type you might carry.
People from regions that have endemic malaria are more likely to be carriers. This includes people from:
Africa
India
the Mediterranean
Saudi Arabia"
sickle cell anemia,sickle cell anemia complications,"SCD can cause severe complications, which appear when the sickle cells block vessels in different areas of the body. Painful or damaging blockages are called sickle cell crises. They can be caused by a variety of circumstances, including:
illness
changes in temperature
stress
poor hydration
altitude
The following are types of complications that can result from sickle cell anemia.
Severe anemia
Anemia is a shortage of RBCs. Sickle cells are easily broken. This breaking apart of RBCs is called chronic hemolysis. RBCs generally live for about 120 days. Sickle cells live for a maximum of 10 to 20 days.
Hand-foot syndrome
Hand-foot syndrome occurs when sickle-shaped RBCs block blood vessels in the hands or feet. This causes the hands and feet to swell. It can also cause leg ulcers. Swollen hands and feet are often the first sign of sickle cell anemia in babies.
Splenic sequestration
Splenic sequestration is a blockage of the splenic vessels by sickle cells. It causes a sudden, painful enlargement of the spleen. The spleen may have to be removed due to complications of sickle cell disease in an operation known as a splenectomy. Some sickle cell patients will sustain enough damage to their spleen that it becomes shrunken and ceases to function at all. This is called autosplenectomy. Patients without a spleen are at higher risk for infections from bacteria such as Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and Salmonella species.
Delayed growth
Delayed growth often occurs in people with SCD. Children are generally shorter but regain their height by adulthood. Sexual maturation may also be delayed. This happens because sickle cell RBCs can�t supply enough oxygen and nutrients.
Neurological complications
Seizures, strokes, or even coma can result from sickle cell disease. They are caused by brain blockages. Immediate treatment should be sought.
Eye problems
Blindness is caused by blockages in the vessels supplying the eyes. This can damage the retina.
Skin ulcers
Skin ulcers in the legs can occur if small vessels there are blocked.
Heart disease and chest syndrome
Since SCD interferes with blood oxygen supply, it can also cause heart problems which can lead to heart attacks, heart failure, and abnormal heart rhythms.
Lung disease
Damage to the lungs over time related to decreased blood flow can result in high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension) and scarring of the lungs (pulmonary fibrosis). These problems can occur sooner in patients who have sickle chest syndrome. Lung damage makes it more difficult for the lungs to transfer oxygen into the blood, which can result in more frequent sickle cell crises.
Priapism
Priapism is a lingering, painful erection that can be seen in some men with sickle cell disease. This happens when the blood vessels in the penis are blocked. It can lead to impotence if left untreated.
Gallstones
Gallstones are one complication not caused by a vessel blockage. Instead, they are caused by the breakdown of RBCs. A byproduct of this breakdown is bilirubin. High levels of bilirubin can lead to gallstones. These are also called pigment stones.
Sickle chest syndrome
Sickle chest syndrome is a severe type of sickle cell crisis. It causes severe chest pain and is associated with symptoms such as cough, fever, sputum production, shortness of breath, and low blood oxygen levels. Abnormalities observed on chest X-rays can represent either pneumonia or death of lung tissue (pulmonary infarction). The long-term prognosis for patients who have had sickle chest syndrome is worse than for those who have not had it."
sickle cell anemia,sickle cell anemia diagnosis,"All newborns in the United States are screened for sickle cell disease. Prebirth testing looks for the sickle cell gene in your amniotic fluid.
In children and adults, one or more of the following procedures may also be used to diagnose sickle cell disease.
Detailed patient history
This condition often first appears as acute pain in the hands and feet. Patients may also have:
severe pain in the bones
anemia
painful enlargement of the spleen
growth problems
respiratory infections
ulcers of the legs
heart problems
Your doctor may want to test you for sickle cell anemia if you have any of the symptoms mentioned above.
Blood tests
Several blood tests can be used to look for SCD:
Blood counts can reveal an abnormal Hb level in the range of 6 to 8 grams per deciliter.
Blood films may show RBCs that appear as irregularly contracted cells.
Sickle solubility tests look for the presence of Hb S.
Hb electrophoresis
Hb electrophoresis is always needed to confirm the diagnosis of sickle cell disease. It measures the different types of hemoglobin in the blood."
upper respiratory infection,upper respiratory infection definition,"What is acute respiratory infection?
Acute respiratory infection is an infection that may interfere with normal breathing. It can affect just your upper respiratory system, which starts at your sinuses and ends at your vocal chords, or just your lower respiratory system, which starts at your vocal chords and ends at your lungs.
This infection is particularly dangerous for children, older adults, and people with immune system disorders."
upper respiratory infection,upper respiratory infection symptoms,"The symptoms you experience will be different if it�s a lower or upper respiratory infection. Symptoms can include:
congestion, either in the nasal sinuses or lungs
runny nose
cough
sore throat
body aches
fatigue
Call your doctor if you experience:
a fever over 103�F (39�C) and chills
difficulty breathing
dizziness
loss of consciousness"
upper respiratory infection,upper respiratory infection causes,"There are several different causes of acute respiratory infection.
Causes of upper respiratory infection:
acute pharyngitis
acute ear infection
common cold
Causes of lower respiratory infection:
bronchitis
pneumonia
bronchiolitis"
upper respiratory infection,upper respiratory infection risks,"It�s almost impossible to avoid viruses and bacteria, but certain risk factors increase your chances of developing acute respiratory infection.
The immune systems of children and older adults are more prone to being affected by viruses.
Children are especially at risk because of their constant contact with other kids who could be virus carriers. Children often don�t wash their hands regularly. They are also more likely to rub their eyes and put their fingers in their mouths, resulting in the spread of viruses.
People with heart disease or other lung problems are more likely to contract an acute respiratory infection. Anyone whose immune system might be weakened by another disease is at risk. Smokers also are at high risk and have more trouble recovering."
upper respiratory infection,upper respiratory infection diagnosis,"In a respiratory exam, the doctor focuses on your breathing. They will check for fluid and inflammation in the lungs by listening for abnormal sounds in your lungs when you breathe. The doctor may peer into your nose and ears, and check your throat.
If your doctor believes the infection is in the lower respiratory tract, an X-ray or CT scan may be necessary to check the condition of the lungs.
Lung function tests have been useful as diagnostic tools. Pulse oximetry, also known as pulse ox, can check how much oxygen gets into the lungs. A doctor may also take a swab from your nose or mouth, or ask you to cough up a sample of sputum (material coughed up from the lungs) to check for the type of virus or bacteria causing the disease."
upper respiratory infection,upper respiratory infection complications,"Complications of acute respiratory infection are extremely serious and can result in permanent damage and even death. They include:
respiratory arrest, which occurs when the lungs stop functioning
respiratory failure, a rise in CO2 in your blood caused by your lungs not functioning correctly
congestive heart failure"
upper respiratory infection,upper respiratory infection prevention,"Most causes of an acute respiratory infection aren�t treatable. Therefore, prevention is the best method to ward off harmful respiratory infections.
Getting the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) and pertussis vaccine will substantially lower your risk of getting a respiratory infection. You may also benefit from influenza vaccination and pneumovax. Talk to your doctor about getting these.
Practice good hygiene:
Wash your hands frequently, especially after you�ve been in a public place.
Always sneeze into the arm of your shirt or in a tissue. Although this may not ease your own symptoms, it will prevent you from spreading infectious diseases.
Avoid touching your face, especially your eyes and mouth, to prevent introducing germs into your system.
Was this helpful?
You should also avoid smoking and make sure you include plenty of vitamins in your diet, such as vitamin C, which helps boost your immune system. Vitamin C is maintained in immune cells, and a deficiency has been linked to higher susceptibility to infection. While research is unclear if Vitamin C can prevent an acute respiratory infection, there is evidence that it can shorten the length of time and or severity of some infections."
hepatitis,hepatitis definition,"Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. It may be caused by viral infection, alcohol consumption, several health conditions, or even some medications. Treatment varies based on the type and underlying cause.
Hepatitis refers to an inflammatory condition of the liver. It is commonly the result of a viral infection, but there are other possible causes of hepatitis.
These include autoimmune hepatitis and hepatitis that occurs as a secondary result of medications, drugs, toxins, and alcohol. Autoimmune hepatitis is a disease that occurs when your body makes antibodies against your liver tissue.
The five main viral classifications of hepatitis are hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. A different virus is responsible for each type of viral hepatitis.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 354 million
people currently live with chronic hepatitis B and C globally."
hepatitis,hepatitis causes,"Type of hepatitis Common route of transmission
hepatitis A exposure to HAV in food or water
hepatitis B contact with HBV in body fluids, such as blood, vaginal secretions, or semen
hepatitis C contact with HCV in body fluids, such as blood, vaginal secretions, or semen
hepatitis D contact with blood containing HDV
hepatitis E exposure to HEV in food or water
Causes of noninfectious hepatitis
Although hepatitis is most commonly the result of an infection, other factors can cause the condition.
Alcohol and other toxins
Excess alcohol consumption can cause liver damage and inflammation. This may also be referred to as alcoholic hepatitis.
The alcohol directly injures the cells of your liver. Over time, it can cause permanent damage and lead to thickening or scarring of liver tissue (cirrhosis) and liver failure.
Other toxic causes of hepatitis include misuse of medications and exposure to toxins.
Autoimmune system response
In some cases, the immune system mistakes the liver as harmful and attacks it. This causes ongoing inflammation that can range from mild to severe, often hindering liver function. It�s three times more common in women than in men.

hepatitis,hepatitis symptoms,"If you are living with a chronic form of hepatitis, like hepatitis B and C, you may not show symptoms until the damage affects liver function. By contrast, people with acute hepatitis may present with symptoms shortly after contracting a hepatitis virus.
Common symptoms of infectious hepatitis include:
fatigue
flu-like symptoms
dark urine
pale stool
abdominal pain
loss of appetite
unexplained weight loss
yellow skin and eyes, which may be signs of jaundice"
hepatitis,hepatitis diagnosis,"It is crucial to understand what is causing hepatitis in order to treat it correctly. Doctors will progress through a series of tests to accurately diagnose your condition.
History and physical exam
To diagnose all forms of hepatitis, your doctor will first take your history to determine any risk factors you may have.
During a physical examination, your doctor may press down gently on your abdomen to see if there�s pain or tenderness. Your doctor may also check for any swelling of the liver and any yellow discoloration in your eyes or skin.
If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here.
Liver function tests
Liver function tests use blood samples to determine how efficiently your liver works.
Abnormal results of these tests may be the first indication that there is a problem, especially if you don�t show any signs on a physical exam of liver disease. High liver enzyme levels may indicate that your liver is stressed, damaged, or not functioning correctly.
Other blood tests
If your liver function tests are abnormal, your doctor will likely order other blood tests to detect the source of the problem.
These tests can determine
if you have infectious hepatitis by checking for the presence of hepatitis viruses or antibodies your body produces to combat them.
Doctors may also use blood tests to check for any signs of autoimmune hepatitis.
Liver biopsy
When diagnosing hepatitis, doctors will also assess your liver for potential damage
. A liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a sample of tissue from your liver.
A medical professional may take this sample through your skin with a needle, meaning there is no need for surgery. They will typically use an ultrasound scan for guidance during this procedure.
This test allows your doctor to determine how infection or inflammation has affected your liver.
Ultrasound
An abdominal ultrasound uses ultrasound waves to create an image of the organs within your abdomen. This test allows your doctor to take a close look at your liver and nearby organs. It can reveal:
fluid in your abdomen
liver damage or enlargement
liver tumors
abnormalities of your gallbladder
Sometimes the pancreas shows up on ultrasound images as well. This can be a useful test in determining the cause of your abnormal liver function."
hepatitis,hepatitis prevention,"There are vaccines that can help protect against many hepatitis viruses. Minimizing your risk of exposure to substances containing these viruses can also be an important preventive measure.
Vaccines
A vaccine for hepatitis A is available and can help prevent the contraction of HAV. The hepatitis A vaccine is a series of two doses and most children begin vaccination at age 12 to 23 months
. This is also available for adults and can also include the hepatitis B vaccine.
The CDC
recommends hepatitis B vaccinations for all newborns. Doctors typically administer the series of three vaccines over the first 6 months of childhood.
The CDC also recommends the vaccine for all healthcare and medical personnel. Vaccination against hepatitis B can also prevent hepatitis D.
There are currently no vaccines for hepatitis C or E.
Reducing exposure
Hepatitis viruses can transmit from person to person through contact with bodily fluids, water, and foods containing infectious agents. Minimizing your risk of contact with these substances can help to prevent contracting hepatitis viruses.
Practicing effective hygiene is one way to avoid contracting hepatitis A and E. The viruses that cause these conditions can be present
in water. If you�re traveling to a country where there is a high prevalence of hepatitis, you should avoid:
local water
ice
raw or undercooked shellfish and oysters
raw fruit and vegetables
The hepatitis B, C, and D viruses can transmit through contact with bodily fluids containing these infectious agents.
You can reduce your risk
of coming into contact with fluids containing these viruses by:
not sharing needles
not sharing razors
not using someone else�s toothbrush
not touching spilled blood
Hepatitis B and C can carry through sexual intercourse and sexual contact. Using barrier methods, such as condoms and dental dams, during sexual activity can help decrease the risk of infection."
hepatitis,hepatitis complications,"Chronic hepatitis B or C can lead to more severe health problems. Because the virus affects the liver, people with chronic hepatitis B or C are at risk of:
chronic liver disease
cirrhosis
liver cancer
When your liver stops functioning normally, liver failure can occur. Complications of liver failure include:
bleeding disorders
a buildup of fluid in your abdomen, known as ascites
increased blood pressure in portal veins that enter your liver, known as portal hypertension
kidney failure
hepatic encephalopathy, which can involve fatigue, memory loss, and diminished mental abilities
hepatocellular carcinoma, which is a form of liver cancer
death
People with chronic hepatitis B and C should avoid alcohol as it can accelerate liver disease and failure. Certain supplements and medications can also affect liver function. If you have chronic hepatitis B or C, check with your doctor before taking any new medications.
Read this article in Spanish."
gout,gout definition,"Gout can be treated and managed with medications and healthy lifestyle habits. Your doctor or nutritionist can help you develop the best treatment strategy for you.
Gout is a general term for a variety of conditions caused by a buildup of uric acid. This buildup usually affects the feet.
If you have gout, you�ll probably feel swelling and pain in the joints of your foot, particularly your big toe. Sudden and intense pain, or gout attacks, can make it feel like your foot is on fire."
gout,gout symptoms,"Some people have too much uric acid in their blood but no symptoms. This is called asymptomatic hyperuricemia.
For acute gout, symptoms come on quickly from the buildup of uric acid crystals in your joint and last for 3 to 10 days.
You�ll have intense pain and swelling, and your joint may feel warm. Between gout attacks, you won�t have any symptoms.
If you don�t treat gout, it can become chronic. Hard lumps called tophi can eventually develop in your joints and the skin and soft tissue surrounding them. These deposits can permanently damage your joints.
Prompt treatment is important to prevent gout from turning chronic."
gout,gout treatment,"If left untreated, gout can eventually lead to gouty arthritis, which is a more severe form of arthritis. This painful condition can leave your joint permanently damaged and swollen.
The treatment plan your doctor recommends will depend on the stage and severity of your gout.
Medications to treat gout work in one of two ways: They relieve pain and bring down inflammation, or they prevent future gout attacks by lowering uric acid levels.
Drugs to relieve gout pain include:
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin (Bufferin), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve)
colchicine (Colcrys, Mitigare)
corticosteroids
Drugs that prevent gout attacks include:
xanthine oxidase inhibitors, such as allopurinol (Lopurin, Zyloprim) and febuxostat (Uloric)
probenecid (Probalan)
Along with medications, your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes to help manage your symptoms and reduce your risk of future gout attacks. For example, your doctor may encourage you to:
reduce your alcohol intake, if you drink
lose weight, if you�re overweight
quit smoking, if you smoke
In addition a few complementary therapies have also shown promise."
gout,gout causes,"The buildup of uric acid in your blood from the breakdown of purines causes gout.
Certain conditions, such as blood and metabolism disorders or dehydration, make your body produce too much uric acid.
A kidney or thyroid problem, or an inherited disorder, can make it harder for your body to remove excess uric acid.
You�re more likely to get gout if you:
are a middle-aged man or postmenopausal woman
have parents, siblings, or other family members with gout
drink alcohol
take medications such as diuretics and cyclosporine
have a condition like high blood pressure, kidney disease, thyroid disease, diabetes, or sleep apnea
For some people, gout is caused by consuming foods that are high in gout-producing purines."
gout,gout diagnosis,"Your doctor can diagnose gout based on a review of your medical history, a physical exam, and your symptoms. Your doctor will likely base your diagnosis on:
your description of your joint pain
how often you�ve experienced intense pain in your joint
how red or swollen the area is
Your doctor may also order a test to check for a buildup of uric acid in your joint. A sample of fluid taken from your joint can show whether it contains uric acid. They may also want to take an X-ray of your joint.
If you have symptoms of gout, you can start with a visit to your primary care doctor. If your gout is severe, you may need to see a specialist in joint diseases.
If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here."
gout,gout prevention,"Here are a few steps you can take to help prevent gout:
Limit how much alcohol you drink.
Limit how much purine-rich food, such as shellfish, lamb, beef, pork, and organ meat, you eat.
Eat a low-fat, nondairy diet that�s rich in vegetables.
Maintain a healthy weight.
Avoid smoking.
Exercise regularly.
Stay hydrated.
If you have medical conditions or take medications that raise your risk of gout, ask your doctor how you can lower your risk of gout attacks."
thrombocytopaenia,thrombocytopaenia definition,"Isolated thrombocytopenia is a condition where your platelet levels are low, but other blood cell levels are within a typical range. It�s rare and potentially dangerous.
Thrombocytopenia is also known as low platelet count. It�s a condition that occurs when your blood doesn�t have enough cells called platelets (or thrombocytes).
Platelets are cells that form clots in response to damage in your blood vessels. A low platelet count can lead to an increased risk of bleeding or bruising.
Thrombocytopenia frequently goes together with other blood conditions, like anemia. But isolated thrombocytopenia occurs when your platelet levels are low, but other blood cell levels are within a typical range.
Isolated thrombocytopenia is relatively rare. Although we don�t know exactly how many people in the world are affected by this condition, some doctors estimate that it occurs in around 5%
of the people they treat with thrombocytopenia.
Untreated isolated thrombocytopenia can be dangerous because of the risk of internal bleeding that can be fatal. Read on to learn more about isolated thrombocytopenia, including its causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options."
thrombocytopaenia,thrombocytopaenia symptoms,"The symptoms of isolated thrombocytopenia can vary depending on how low your platelet count is. Some people may not experience any symptoms, while others may have frequent bleeding or bruising.
Symptoms of isolated thrombocytopenia can include
:
easy bruising
nosebleeds
bleeding gums
bleeding from cuts that doesn�t stop for a long time
petechiae, or small red or purple dots on the skin
purpura, or purple or brown bruise-like spots on the skin
heavy menstrual bleeding
In more severe cases you may have internal bleeding. Symptoms of internal bleeding include:
blood in the stool or tarry stools
blood in urine
vomiting blood"
thrombocytopaenia,thrombocytopaenia causes,"Isolated thrombocytopenia can be chronic (long-term) and acute (short-term). These conditions can have different causes.
Acute isolated thrombocytopenia can be caused by:
autoimmune thrombocytopenia
certain medications, like quinine or chemotherapy drugs
pregnancy
Chronic isolated thrombocytopenia, on the other hand, can result from:
liver conditions like nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
viral infections like HIV or viral hepatitis
certain autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis
some antibiotics and other drugs"
thrombocytopaenia,thrombocytopaenia complications,"Complications of isolated thrombocytopenia include internal bleeding of the brain or the intestines. Left untreated, these complications can be fatal.
Isolated thrombocytopenia in pregnancy
Mild thrombocytopenia can happen in pregnancy, and it�s usually not a cause for concern. But in rare cases, thrombocytopenia can be severe. Very low platelet levels can have serious complications for both mom and baby, like:
dangerously heavy bleeding during and after delivery
inability to get an epidural due to potential complications
premature delivery"
thrombocytopaenia,thrombocytopaenia diagnosis,"The diagnosis of isolated thrombocytopenia typically begins with a physical exam. If your doctor suspects a low platelet count, they may check your skin for petechia or purpura. They�ll also ask about your medical history to look for potential causes of this condition.
Your doctor will then run several lab tests. One of the first tests will likely be a blood test called complete blood count (CBC). This test measures the levels of all cells in your blood. It can help your doctor figure out if your platelets are low and if other cells are affected as well.
If only platelets are affected, they�ll likely diagnose you with isolated thrombocytopenia.
Other tests may include:
abdominal ultrasound to look at your spleen
bone marrow biopsy or aspiration
other tests that might help with identifying the cause of your condition"
thrombocytopaenia,thrombocytopaenia treatment,"Treatment of isolated thrombocytopenia depends on the severity of your condition and the underlying cause. If your platelet count is only slightly low and there are no symptoms, you may not need any treatment. Instead, your doctor will likely monitor you to ensure your condition doesn�t worsen.
But you might need treatment if your platelet count is significantly low or you have symptoms. Treatment may include medications that suppress your immune system, for example:
corticosteroids
immunoglobulins
other immunosuppressants
In some cases, if your condition is severe or if medications don�t work as expected, a procedure called a splenectomy may be necessary. This procedure involves removing the spleen.
Be sure to discuss the potential benefits and risks of your treatment with your doctor."
hypoglycemia,hypoglycemia definition,"You may get low blood sugar due eating too few carbohydrates or taking certain medications. Treatment may include easily digestible carbs, medication, or urgent medical care, depending on severity.
Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) happens when your blood sugar (glucose) drops below the typical range. If your blood sugar drops too low, you may need immediate treatment.
Hypoglycemia is more common
in people with diabetes.
This article will take a closer look at hypoglycemia, as well as the symptoms and treatment and how to prevent your blood sugar from dropping too low."
hypoglycemia,hypoglycemia symptoms,"Illustration by Sophia Smith
Symptoms of low blood sugar can occur suddenly. They may include:
pale skin
unexplained fatigue
hunger
shaking
sweating
dizziness
rapid heartbeat
mood changes
irritability or anxiety
headache
difficulty sleeping
skin tingling
blurry vision
trouble thinking clearly or concentrating
loss of consciousness, seizure, or coma
Hypoglycemia unawareness
Some people may have low blood sugar without any symptoms. This is called hypoglycemia unawareness.
If you have this condition, your blood sugar can drop without you noticing it. Without immediate treatment, you may faint, experience a seizure, or even go into a coma.
If you have hypoglycemia unawareness, you may need to check your blood sugar levels more regularly. A doctor may recommend a continuous glucose monitor, a device that can alert you to changes in your blood sugar levels.
What to do if you have low blood sugar symptoms
If you have diabetes and are experiencing mild to moderate hypoglycemia symptoms, you need to immediately eat or drink 15 grams (g) of easily digestible carbohydrates.
Examples of easily digestible carbohydrates
1/2 cup of juice or regular (non-diet) soda
1 tablespoon of honey
4 or 5 saltines
3 or 4 pieces of hard candy or glucose tablets
1 tablespoon of sugar

Very low blood sugar is a medical emergency. If you or someone else with diabetes is experiencing severe symptoms, such as loss of consciousness, it�s important to administer a medication called glucagon and contact local emergency services immediately.
If you�re at risk for low blood sugar, a doctor can prescribe glucagon.
Never give an unconscious person anything by mouth, as it could cause choking. If you have diabetes, make sure your family and friends know not to do this if you lose consciousness."
hypoglycemia,hypoglycemia causes,"Low blood sugar can occur for a number of reasons. It�s usually a side effect of diabetes treatment.
Possible causes in people with diabetes
If you have diabetes, your blood sugar levels may sometimes become too low as a result of your treatment. Hypoglycemia may also occur if you:
take too much medication, including insulin or medications that increase insulin production
plan to eat a big meal and take your medication accordingly but then do not eat enough
skip meals or fast
eat less than usual
eat later than usual but take your medication at the usual time
engage in unplanned, excessive physical activity without eating enough
drink alcohol, which can affect how your body manages your blood sugar levels
become sick and cannot keep food down
Blood sugar regulation
Blood sugar regulation aims to prevent spikes and drops by keeping your blood sugar levels stable.
If you have untreated diabetes or are unaware that you have diabetes, you may experience low or high blood sugar. You can help manage your blood sugar levels with dietary changes, regular physical activity, and medication if needed.
Hypoglycemia after meals
You may develop low blood sugar levels after eating due to the composition of your meals. Contributing factors can include:
consumption of too few carbohydrates
consumption of too few carbohydrates without a reduction in the amount of insulin you take
consumption of more carbohydrates from liquids than usual, as your body absorbs them more quickly than solids
the amounts of other nutrients, such as fat, protein, and fiber, you are consuming
Possible causes in people without diabetes
Even if you don�t have diabetes, you may experience low blood sugar, though it is less common.
Possible causes of low blood sugar in people who don�t have diabetes include:
certain medications, such as quinine
some medical conditions, such as hepatitis and kidney disorders
a tumor that produces excess insulin
severe illnesses such as cerebral malaria and sepsis
endocrine disorders such as adrenal gland deficiency
anorexia nervosa"
hypoglycemia,hypoglycemia diagnosis,"If you suspect you have low blood sugar, it�s important to check your blood sugar right away. If you don�t have a blood glucose meter and you�re taking diabetes medications that increase insulin, talk with your doctor about getting a meter.
If you experience low blood sugar a few times per week, talk with a doctor right away to find out why. They may begin your visit by requesting your medical history, asking questions about your eating habits, and learning more about your symptoms.
If you don�t have diabetes but suspect you have hypoglycemia, talk with a doctor about your symptoms. A doctor will use three criteria, sometimes referred to as Whipple�s triad, to diagnose low blood sugar:
Signs and symptoms of low blood sugar: A doctor may require you to fast (abstain from drinking and eating for an extended period) so they can observe signs and symptoms.
Documentation of low blood sugar when your signs and symptoms occur: A doctor will order a blood test to analyze your blood sugar levels in a laboratory.
Disappearance of the signs and symptoms of low blood sugar: A doctor will want to know whether the signs and symptoms go away when your blood sugar levels are raised.
The doctor may send you home with a blood glucose meter to track your blood sugar over time at home. They may ask that you check your blood sugar at certain times of the day, such as after waking up and after eating meals.
If you need help finding a primary care doctor, check out our FindCare tool.
How to check your blood sugar at home
To perform a blood sugar test, you will need to prick your finger with a lancet (provided in a blood glucose test kit). You�ll put a small sample of blood from this onto a strip inserted into the blood glucose meter.
Before you check your blood sugar at home, it�s important to find out from a doctor what a healthy blood sugar range is for you. The doctor will determine this range based on factors such as:
the type of diabetes you have
how long you�ve had diabetes
your age
whether you have any other chronic health conditions
If you don�t have a blood glucose meter on hand and are experiencing symptoms of low blood sugar with diabetes, your symptoms may be enough to diagnose low blood sugar."
hypoglycemia,hypoglycemia complications,"Mildly low blood sugar levels are somewhat common for people with diabetes. However, severely low blood sugar levels can be life threatening. Complications may include:
seizures
nervous system damage
loss of consciousness
death
Avoid driving if you are experiencing low blood sugar, as it can increase your risk of having an accident."
hypoglycemia,hypoglycemia prevention,"There are several ways you can prevent low blood sugar.
Check your blood sugar often
Regularly checking your blood sugar level can help you keep it in your target range. If you�ve had low blood sugar episodes in the past, you may want to check your blood sugar levels before driving or operating machinery.
A doctor can advise you on how often to check your blood sugar.
Snack wisely
Consider having a snack before you leave your home if you know it will be more than 5 hours until your next full meal or if your blood sugar levels are lower than 100 mg/dL.
It�s a good idea to keep carbohydrate-rich snacks on hand at all times in case your blood sugar dips while you�re out.
Fuel your body during exercise
Exercise uses up energy, so it can quickly cause your blood sugar to drop if you haven�t eaten enough beforehand. Check your blood sugar 1�2 hours before exercising to make sure it�s within your target range.
If it�s too low, eat a small meal or carbohydrate-rich snack.
If you plan to exercise for an hour or longer, consume additional carbohydrates during your workout. Exercise gels, sports drinks, granola bars, and even candy bars can provide your body with a quick burst of glucose during exercise.
Healthcare professionals can come up with the right program for you.
Your blood sugar may drop for up to 24 hours after moderate to intense exercise. Doctors recommend checking your blood sugar level immediately after exercise and then every 2�4 hours until you go to sleep. Avoid intense exercise immediately before bed.
Follow guidance around medications
If you follow a meal plan or take medications that increase your insulin level, it�s important to stick to the plan your doctor has prescribed to help prevent low blood sugar.
Not eating the right foods or taking the right medications at the correct times can cause your blood sugar to drop. Check in often with your doctor so they can adjust your treatment plan if and when necessary.
Q:
I just started a weight loss program, and I keep having a big drop in my blood sugar levels after breakfast. Any advice?
� From our Facebook community
A:
It sounds like you may be experiencing something called reactive hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar after eating a meal, which is most likely due to a change in diet.
To manage this problem, I recommend consistent and frequent meals and snacks every 3�4 hours that are a mix of high fiber carbohydrates, fat, and protein.
Eating high fiber carbohydrates is important because they provide the sugar the body needs, but they are also what causes the body to release insulin.
Make sure to add some protein or fat to all of your meals and snacks. Protein and fat can help slow the digestion of carbohydrates, which helps manage the release of insulin and allows for the slow and steady digestion of carbs.
Be sure to discuss any changes to your diet with your primary care physician.

pneumonia aspiration,pneumonia aspiration definition,"Aspiration pneumonia is a complication of pulmonary aspiration. Pulmonary aspiration is when you inhale food, stomach acid, or saliva into your lungs.
You can also aspirate food that travels back up from your stomach to your esophagus. All of these things may carry bacteria that affect your lungs. Healthy lungs can clear up on their own. If they don�t, pneumonia can develop as a complication."
pneumonia aspiration,pneumonia aspiration symptoms,"Someone with aspiration pneumonia may show symptoms of poor oral hygiene and throat clearing or wet coughing after eating. Other symptoms of this condition include:
chest pain
shortness of breath
wheezing
fatigue
blue discoloration of the skin
cough, possibly with green sputum, blood, or a foul odor
difficulty swallowing
bad breath
excessive sweating
Anyone exhibiting these symptoms should contact their doctor. Let them know if you�ve recently inhaled any food or liquids. It�s especially critical that children under 2 years of age or adults over the age of 65 get medical attention and a quick diagnosis.
Don�t hesitate to go to the doctor if you�re coughing up colored sputum or have a lingering fever over 102�F (38�C) in addition to the symptoms mentioned above."
pneumonia aspiration,pneumonia aspiration causes,"Pneumonia from aspiration can occur when your defenses are impaired and the aspirated contents have a large amount of harmful bacteria.
You can aspirate and develop pneumonia if your food or drink �goes down the wrong way.� This may happen even if you can swallow normally and have a regular gag reflex. In that case, most of the time you�ll be able to prevent this by coughing. Those who have impaired coughing ability, however, may not be able to. This impairment may be due to:
neurological disorders
throat cancer
medical conditions like myasthenia gravis or Parkinson�s disease
excessive use of alcohol or prescription or illegal drugs
use of sedatives or anesthesia
a weakened immune system
esophageal disorders
dental problems that interfere with chewing or swallowing"
pneumonia aspiration,pneumonia aspiration risks,"Risk factors for aspiration pneumonia include people with:
impaired consciousness
lung disease
seizure
stroke
dental problems
dementia
swallowing dysfunction
impaired mental status
certain neurologic diseases
radiation therapy to the head and neck
heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux)
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)"
pneumonia aspiration,pneumonia aspiration diagnosis,"Your doctor will look for signs of pneumonia during a physical exam, such as a decreased flow of air, rapid heart rate, and a crackling sound in your lungs. Your doctor may also run a series of tests to confirm pneumonia. These may include:
chest X-ray
sputum culture
complete blood count (CBC)
arterial blood gas
bronchoscopy
computed tomography (CT) scan of your chest area
blood culture
Because pneumonia is a serious condition, it requires treatment. You should have some of your test results within 24 hours. Blood and sputum cultures will take three to five days."
pneumonia aspiration,pneumonia aspiration prevention,"Prevention tips
Avoid behaviors that can lead to aspiration, such as excessive drinking.
Be careful when taking medications that can make you feel drowsy.
Receive proper dental care on a regular basis.

Your doctor may recommend a swallow evaluation by a licensed speech pathologist or swallow therapist. They can work with you on swallowing strategies and throat muscle strengthening. You may also need to change your diet.
Surgery risk: Follow your doctor�s orders about fasting to lower the chance of vomiting under anesthesia."
colitis,colitis definition,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Symptoms can range from mild to severe. In some cases, you may not have any symptoms. Treatment focuses on managing or reducing symptoms.
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD comprises a group of diseases that affect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
UC occurs when the lining of your large intestine (also called the colon), rectum, or both become inflamed.
This inflammation produces tiny sores called ulcers on the lining of your colon. Inflammation usually begins in the rectum and spreads upward. It can involve your entire colon.
The inflammation causes your bowel to move its contents rapidly and empty frequently. As cells on the surface of the lining of your bowel die, ulcers form. The ulcers may cause bleeding and discharge of mucus and pus.
While this condition affects people of all ages, most people develop UC between ages 15 and 30 years old, according to the American Gastroenterological Association. After 50 years old, there�s another small increase in diagnosis of IBD, usually in men."
colitis,colitis symptoms,"The seriousness of UC symptoms varies among people who have the condition. The symptoms can also change over time.
People diagnosed with UC may experience periods of mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. This is called remission. However, symptoms can return and become severe. This is called a flare-up.
Common symptoms of UC include:
abdominal pain
increased abdominal sounds
bloody stools
diarrhea
fever
rectal pain
weight loss
malnutrition
UC may cause additional symptoms, such as:
joint pain
joint swelling
nausea and decreased appetite
skin problems
mouth sores
eye inflammation"
colitis,colitis causes,"Researchers believe that UC may be the result of an overactive immune system. However, it�s unclear why some immune systems respond by attacking the large intestines, and others don�t.
Factors that may play a role in who develops UC include:
Genes. You may inherit a gene from a parent that increases your chance of having UC.
Other immune disorders. If you have one type of immune disorder, your chance of developing a second is higher.
Environmental factors. Bacteria, viruses, and antigens may trigger your immune system."
colitis,colitis diagnosis,"Different tests can help a doctor diagnose UC. UC mimics other bowel diseases such as Crohn�s disease. A doctor will order multiple tests to rule out other conditions.
Tests to diagnose UC often include:
Blood tests. Blood tests are often useful in the diagnosis of UC. A complete blood count looks for signs of anemia (a low red blood cell count). Other tests indicate inflammation, such as a high level of C-reactive protein and a high sedimentation rate. A doctor may also order specialized antibody tests.
Stool test. A doctor examines your stool for certain inflammatory markers, blood, bacteria, and parasites.
CT scan. This is a specialized X-ray of your abdomen and pelvis.
Endoscopy. A doctor uses a flexible tube to examine your stomach, esophagus, and small intestine.
Biopsy. A surgeon removes a tissue sample from your colon for analysis.
Flexible sigmoidoscopy. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is a type of endoscopy. During this test, a doctor inserts a long, flexible tube into your rectum so that they can examine it, the sigmoid colon, and part of the descending colon. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is also known as sigmoidoscopy.
Colonoscopy. During a colonoscopy, a doctor inserts a lighted scope called a colonoscope into your rectum to examine the inside of your colon. It�s also a type of endoscopy.
Were you recently diagnosed? Here�s what you need to know about treating and living with UC."
colitis,colitis treatment,"UC is a chronic condition. The goal of treatment is to reduce the inflammation that causes your symptoms to prevent flare-ups and have longer periods of remission.
Medication
Which medication you�ll take will depend on your specific situation, including how severe your symptoms are.
For mild symptoms, your doctor may prescribe a medication to reduce inflammation and swelling. This will help alleviate many symptoms.
These types of medications include 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA drugs) such as:
mesalamine (Asacol HD, Lialda)
sulfasalazine (Azulfidine)
balsalazide (Colazal)
olsalazine (Dipentum)
Some people may need corticosteroids to help reduce inflammation, but these can have adverse effects, so doctors try to limit their use. If an infection is present, you may need antibiotics.
If you have moderate to severe symptoms, a doctor may prescribe a type of medication known as a biologic. Biologics are made from antibodies and help block inflammation. Taking these can help prevent a symptom flare-up.
Effective options for most people include:
adalimumab (Humira)
golimumab (Simponi)
infliximab (Remicade)
tofacitinib (Xeljanz)
ustekinumab (Stelara)
vedolizumab (Entyvio)
A doctor may also prescribe an immunomodulator. These change the way the immune system works. Examples include methotrexate, 5-ASA drugs, and thiopurine drugs. However, current guidelines don�t recommend these as standalone treatments.
In 2018, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved the use of tofacitinib (Xeljanz) as a treatment for UC. Initially used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, this medication targets cells responsible for inflammation. It�s the first oral medication approved for the long-term treatment of UC.
Hospitalization
If your symptoms are severe, you�ll need to be hospitalized to correct the effects of dehydration and loss of electrolytes that diarrhea causes. You may also need to replace blood and to treat any other complications.
Researchers continue to look for new treatments each year. Learn more about the newest UC treatments.
Ulcerative colitis surgery
Surgery is necessary if you experience:
substantial blood loss
chronic and debilitating symptoms
perforation of your colon
a severe blockage
A CT scan or colonoscopy can detect these serious problems.
Surgery typically involves removing your entire colon and rectum as well as creating a new pathway for waste. This pathway can be out through a small opening in your abdominal wall.
To redirect waste through your abdominal wall, the surgeon will make a small opening in the wall. The tip of your lower small intestine, or the ileum, is then brought to the skin�s surface. Waste will drain through the opening into a bag.
In other types of surgery, the surgeon removes the diseased part of your colon and rectum but retains the outer muscles of your rectum. The surgeon then attaches your small intestine to the rectum to form a small pouch. After this surgery, you�re able to pass stool through your rectum. Bowel movements will be more frequent and watery than normal.
In certain procedures, the anus is also removed. Read more about each of the surgical options and their long-term effects."
colitis,colitis complications,"UC increases your risk of developing colon cancer. The longer you have the disease, the higher your risk of this cancer.
Because of this increased risk, your doctor will perform a colonoscopy and check for cancer when you receive your diagnosis.
Repeat screenings every 1 to 3 years
are recommended thereafter, according to the American Cancer Society. Regular screenings help lower your risk of colon cancer. Follow-up screenings can detect precancerous cells early.
Other complications of UC include:
thickening of the intestinal wall
intestinal bleeding
sepsis, or blood infection
severe dehydration
toxic megacolon, or a rapidly swelling colon
rupture of your colon
inflammation of your skin, joints, and eyes
ankylosing spondylitis, which involves inflammation of joints between your spinal bones
kidney stones
liver disease, which is rare
Complications of UC are worse if the condition isn�t properly treated. Learn more about the complications of unmanaged UC."
colitis,colitis risks,"Most people with UC don�t have a family history of the condition. However, about 12 percent of people with UC do have a family member with IBD, according to research from 2014.
UC can develop in a person of any race, but it�s more common in white people. If you�re of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, you have a greater chance of developing the condition than most other groups.
Young people with IBD may also be dealing with acne at the same time. Some older studies have suggested a possible link between the use of the cystic acne medication isotretinoin (Absorbica, Amnesteem, Claravis) and UC. However, newer research has yet to find a definitive causal relationship."
colitis,colitis prevention,"There�s no solid evidence indicating that your diet affects whether you develop UC. You may find that certain foods and drinks aggravate your symptoms when you have a flare-up, though.
Practices that may help include:
drinking small amounts of water throughout the day
eating smaller meals throughout the day
limiting your intake of high fiber foods
avoiding fatty foods
lowering your intake of milk if you�re lactose intolerant
Also, ask a doctor if you should take a multivitamin."
diverticulosis,diverticulosis definition,Diverticulitis can cause digestive symptoms and abdominal pain. Some people may develop complications that require urgent medical care.
diverticulosis,diverticulosis symptoms,"Diverticulitis can cause symptoms ranging from mild to severe. These symptoms can appear suddenly, or they can develop gradually over several days.
Potential symptoms of diverticular disease include
:
pain in your abdomen
bloating
diarrhea
constipation
If you develop diverticulitis, you might experience:
constant or severe pain in your abdomen
nausea and vomiting
fever and chills
blood in your stool
bleeding from your rectum
Abdominal pain is the most common
symptom of diverticulitis. It will most likely occur in the lower left side of your abdomen. It can also develop in the right side of your abdomen.
If you develop any of the above symptoms, it may be a sign of a serious complication from diverticulitis or another condition. Call your doctor right away."
diverticulosis,diverticulosis causes,"Diverticular disease develops when pouches form along your digestive tract, typically in your colon (large intestine). These pouches (diverticula) can become inflamed and infected, which may occur when feces or partially digested food blocks the opening of the diverticula.
Although there�s no single known cause of diverticular disease, several factors can increase the risk of developing diverticulitis, including
:
genetics
diet
decreased immune function
having obesity
physical inactivity
smoking
changes in the gut microbiome
certain medications, such as steroids"
diverticulosis,diverticulosis complications,"More than 75 percent
of diverticulitis cases are uncomplicated, leaving about 25 percent to develop complications.
These complications can include:
abscess, an infected pocket that�s filled with pus
phlegmon, an infected area that�s less well-confined than an abscess
fistula, an abnormal connection that can develop between two organs or between an organ and the skin
intestinal perforation, a tear or hole in the intestinal wall that can allow the contents of your colon to leak into your abdominal cavity, causing inflammation and infection
intestinal obstruction, a blockage in your intestine that can stop stool from passing"
diverticulosis,diverticulosis diagnosis,"To diagnose diverticulitis, your doctor will likely ask about your symptoms, health history, and any medications you take. They�ll likely perform a physical exam to check your abdomen for tenderness.
If they need more information, they may perform a digital rectal exam to check for:
rectal bleeding
pain
masses
other problems
Several other conditions can cause symptoms that are similar to diverticulitis. To rule out other conditions and check for signs of diverticulitis, your doctor might order one or more tests.
Tests can include:
abdominal ultrasound, abdominal MRI scan, abdominal CT scan, or abdominal X-ray to create pictures of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract
colonoscopy to examine the inside of your GI tract; although this takes place after a bout of diverticulosis
stool test to check for infections, such as Clostridium difficile (C. diff)
urine test to check for infections
blood tests to check for signs of inflammation, anemia, or kidney or liver problems
pelvic exam to rule out gynecological problems in people assigned female at birth
pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy in people assigned female at birth
If you have diverticulitis, these exams and tests can help your doctor learn if it�s uncomplicated or complicated.
Using a colonoscopy to diagnose diverticulitis
If you have symptoms of diverticulitis, your doctor might
encourage you to have a colonoscopy once the acute episode resolves. This procedure can help confirm a diagnosis of diverticulitis or another condition that causes similar symptoms, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn�s disease.
During a colonoscopy, your doctor will thread a flexible scope into your rectum and colon. They can use this scope to examine the inside of your colon. They can also use it to collect tissue samples for testing.
To help you feel more comfortable during this procedure, you will be sedated beforehand.
In some cases, your doctor might learn that you have diverticula during a routine colonoscopy. If the diverticula aren�t inflamed, infected, or causing symptoms, you probably won�t need treatment."
diverticulosis,diverticulosis treatment,"The treatment that your doctor prescribes for diverticulitis will depend on how severe your condition is.
Uncomplicated diverticulitis can typically be treated at home. Your doctor might
encourage you to make changes to your diet. In some cases, they might prescribe medications, including antibiotics.
If you develop complications from diverticulitis, you may need
to visit a hospital for treatment. You may be given fluids and antibiotics through an intravenous (IV) line. Depending on the type of complication, you might need to undergo surgery or another procedure."
diverticulosis,diverticulosis prevention,"More research is needed to learn what causes diverticular disease, including diverticulitis. Currently, experts believe multiple factors play a part. Some potential risk factors may be modified through lifestyle changes.
For example, it might help
to:
try to maintain a moderate body weight
eat a diet that�s high in fiber to help bulk up stools (however, in acute diverticulitis, you may want to avoid fiber)
limit your consumption of saturated fat
get enough vitamin D
get regular exercise if possible
try to avoid cigarette smoke
These prevention strategies can also help promote good overall health."
diverticulosis,diverticulosis risks,"One of the main risk factors for diverticulitis is age. Older people are more likely than younger people to develop diverticulitis. It commonly occurs
in men under 50 and women ages 50 to 70.
People who develop diverticula at a younger age
may be more likely to experience diverticulitis. Younger people are also more likely
to be admitted to a hospital if they have diverticulitis than older people.
According to a review of research
published in 2018, other potential risk factors for diverticulitis include:
Family history
Studies have found that genetics play a role in diverticular disease, with some reports estimating that roughly 40 to 50 percent
of the potential risk of diverticular disease is hereditary.
Low levels of vitamin D
Some studies
suggest that people with higher levels of vitamin D might have a lower risk of getting diverticulitis. More research is needed to understand the potential link between vitamin D and diverticula.
Obesity
Several studies
have found that people with higher body mass index (BMI) and larger waists are at increased risk of diverticulitis.
It�s possible that obesity raises the risk of diverticulitis by changing the balance of bacteria in your gut, but more research is needed to understand the role this plays.
Physical inactivity
Some studies
have found that physically active people are less likely than inactive people to develop diverticulitis. However, this link still needs more research.
Using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or smoking
Regular use of aspirin, ibuprofen, or other NSAIDs may raise your risk of diverticulitis.
People who smoke are also more likely than nonsmokers to develop diverticular disease, including diverticulitis.
According to a 2017 review of research
, there�s no strong evidence that drinking alcohol raises your risk of this disease.
If you drink alcohol, your doctor will likely encourage you to drink in moderation only. Although alcohol consumption might not cause diverticulitis, drinking too much can raise your risk of many other health problems."
suicide attempt,suicide attempt definition,"It�s important to know what warning signs to look for if you or someone you know is dealing with suicidal ideation. Remember, you are not alone and treatment and support can help you.
If your doctor diagnoses you with suicidal ideation, it means that you�re preoccupied with the idea of suicide. You may regularly think about the way you would commit suicide or think about what life would be like if you weren�t around. You may also replay the suicidal act out in your mind.

lymphoma,lymphoma definition,Lymphoma refers to cancer that starts in the lymphatic system and affects white blood cells called lymphocytes.
lymphoma,lymphoma symptoms,"Lymphoma may not always cause symptoms in its early stages. Instead, a doctor may discover enlarged lymph nodes during a physical examination. These may feel like small, soft nodules under the skin. A person may feel the lymph nodes in the:
neck
upper chest
armpit
stomach
groin
Likewise, many of the symptoms of early lymphoma are not specific. That makes them easy to overlook. These common early symptoms of lymphoma include:
chills
cough
fatigue
enlarged spleen
fever
night sweats
itchy rash
shortness of breath
skin itching
stomach pain
loss of appetite
unexplained weight loss
Because the symptoms of lymphoma are often easily overlooked, it can be difficult to detect and then diagnose it in an early stage. It�s important to know how the symptoms may begin to change as the cancer worsens."
lymphoma,lymphoma causes,"Lymphoma occurs when white blood cells called lymphocytes grow out of control. The average life span of a lymphocytes cell is brief, and then the cell dies. In people with lymphoma, however, DNA changes inside the lymphocytes cells cause them to thrive and spread instead of dying.
It�s unclear what exactly causes this DNA change, and even though there are some risk factors connected with lymphoma, people without the risk factors can still develop these cancers."
lymphoma,lymphoma risks,"Most diagnosed lymphoma cases have no known cause. However, some people are considered to be at higher risk.
Non-Hodgkin�s lymphoma risk factors
Risk factors for NHL include:
Immunodeficiency. This could be due to a weak immune system from HIV or taking an immune system-suppressing drug after an organ transplant.
Autoimmune disease. People with certain autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and celiac disease, have an increased risk of lymphoma.
Age. Lymphoma is most common in older individuals. However, some types are more common in children and infants.
Sex. The overall risk of NHL is higher in men than women, but there are some types of NHL that are more likely to develop in women.
Ethnicity. White people in the United States are more likely to develop some types of lymphoma than African Americans or Asian Americans.
Infection. People who have had infections such as the human T-cell leukemia/lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1), Heliobacter pylori, hepatitis C, or the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are associated with an increased risk.
Chemical and radiation exposure. Those exposed to chemicals in pesticides, fertilizers, and herbicides are also at increased risk. Nuclear radiation can also increase risks for developing NHL.
Body size. Individuals living with obesity may be at a higher risk of developing lymphoma, but more research is needed to understand this possible risk factor.
Hodgkin�s lymphoma risk factors
Risk factors for Hodgkin�s lymphoma include:
Age. More cases are diagnosed in people between the ages of 20 and 30 and in people over 55.
Sex. Men are more likely than women to develop this type of lymphoma.
Family history. If a sibling is diagnosed with this type of cancer, your risk of also developing it is higher.
Infectious mononucleosis. An EBV infection can cause mononucleosis. This infection can increase the risk of lymphoma.
Immunodeficiency. Individuals with HIV have a greater risk of developing lymphoma."
lymphoma,lymphoma diagnosis,"Typically, a doctor will do a biopsy if they suspect lymphoma. This involves removing cells from an enlarged lymph node. A specialist known as a hematopathologist will examine the cells to determine if lymphoma cells are present and what cell type they are.
If the hematopathologist detects lymphoma cells, further testing can identify how far the cancer has spread. These tests can include
a chest X-ray
blood testing to check on white and red blood cell count
testing nearby lymph nodes or tissues
a bone marrow aspiration, where a small amount of liquid is taken from bone marrow and tested
a lumbar puncture (spinal tap), where a small amount of fluid from the spine is removed and tested
an abdominal ultrasound
Imaging scans, such as CT or MRI scans may also identify additional tumors or enlarged lymph nodes."
encephalopathy,encephalopathy definition,"What is encephalopathy?
Encephalopathy is a general term describing a disease that affects the function or structure of your brain. There are many types of encephalopathy and brain disease. Some types are permanent and some are temporary. Some types are present from birth and never change, while others are acquired after birth and may get progressively worse."
encephalopathy,encephalopathy causes,"The following are some major types of encephalopathy, along with their causes.
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy
This type of encephalopathy occurs when there are multiple traumas or injuries to the brain. These blows to the head lead to nerve damage in the brain. It�s usually found in boxers, football players, or members of the military who have been injured in explosions.
Glycine encephalopathy
Glycine encephalopathy is a genetic, or inherited, condition in which there are abnormally high levels of glycine (an amino acid) in the brain. Symptoms of glycine encephalopathy usually appear in infants soon after birth.
Hashimoto�s encephalopathy
This is a rare type of encephalopathy that�s linked to an autoimmune condition known as Hashimoto�s thyroiditis. In Hashimoto�s thyroiditis, your immune system mistakenly attacks your thyroid gland. Your thyroid gland is responsible for producing many of your body�s regulating hormones. Scientists don�t yet know exactly how the two conditions are linked.
Hepatic encephalopathy
Hepatic encephalopathy is a result of liver disease. When your liver isn�t functioning properly, the toxins that your liver usually removes from your body are instead allowed to build up in your blood, and can eventually reach your brain.
Hypertensive encephalopathy
Hypertensive encephalopathy is a result of severely high blood pressure that goes untreated for too long. This can cause your brain to swell, leading to brain damage and hypertensive encephalopathy.
Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy
This condition is a type of brain damage that is caused when the brain doesn�t get enough oxygen. This can result in permanent brain damage or dysfunction. It can be caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain, such as when a developing baby is exposed to alcohol in the womb.
Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy
Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy is a result of infections, toxins, or organ failure. When the electrolytes, hormones, or other chemicals in the body are off their normal balance, they can impact the brain�s function. This can also include the presence of an infection in the body or presence of toxic chemicals. The encephalopathy usually resolves when the underlying chemical imbalance is restored or offending infection/toxin removed.
Infectious encephalopathies
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are also known as prion diseases. Prions are proteins that occur naturally in the body, but they can mutate and cause diseases that gradually damage and deteriorate your brain (neurodegenerative diseases). Prion diseases include:
chronic wasting disease
fatal familial insomnia
kuru
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
Uremic encephalopathy
Uremic encephalopathy is a result of kidney failure. It is believed to be caused by the buildup of uremic toxins in the blood. This condition can cause mild confusion to deep coma.
Wernicke encephalopathy
Also known as Wernicke�s disease, this condition is a result of vitamin B-1 deficiency. Long-term alcoholism, poor nutritional intake, and poor food absorption can cause a vitamin B-1 deficiency. If Wernicke encephalopathy isn�t treated quickly, it can lead to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome."
encephalopathy,encephalopathy symptoms,"Your symptoms will depend on the cause and severity of your encephalopathy.
Mental changes
You may have difficulty with memory or focusing. You may also have trouble with problem-solving skills.
Other people may notice symptoms in you before you do. A changing personality is one such symptom. For example, you may be more outgoing than you were before the encephalopathy. You may be more or less calm than you were before the disease.
You could also be lethargic and drowsy.
Neurological symptoms
Possible neurological symptoms include:
muscle weakness in one area
poor decision-making or concentration
involuntary twitching
trembling
difficulty speaking or swallowing
seizures"
encephalopathy,encephalopathy diagnosis,"To diagnose encephalopathy, your doctor will ask you questions about your medical history and your symptoms. They will also perform a medical exam to check for mental and neurological symptoms.
If your doctor suspects that you have brain disease, they may conduct tests to determine the causes and severity of your disease. Tests may include:
blood tests to detect diseases, bacteria, viruses, toxins, hormonal or chemical imbalance, or prions
spinal tap (your doctor will take a sample of your spinal fluid to look for diseases, bacteria, viruses, toxins, or prion)
CT or MRI scan of your brain to detect abnormalities or damage
electroencephalogram (EEG) test to measure the electrical activity in your brain"
encephalopathy,encephalopathy prevention,"Some types of encephalopathy � such as hereditary types � are not preventable. However, other types are preventable.
Making the following changes can reduce your risk of developing many of the underlying causes of encephalopathy:
avoiding excess alcohol
reducing exposure to toxic substances like drugs
eating a healthy diet
seeing your doctor regularly
Living a healthy lifestyle can help reduce your risk factors for brain disease."
tricuspid valve insufficiency,tricuspid valve insufficiency definition,"What is tricuspid regurgitation?
In order to understand tricuspid regurgitation, it helps to understand the basic anatomy of your heart.
Your heart is divided into four sections called chambers. The upper chambers are the left atrium and right atrium, and the lower chambers are the left ventricle and right ventricle. The left and right sides of the heart are separated by a wall of muscle called the septum.
The upper (atria) and lower (ventricles) chambers are connected. Openings called valves regulate blood flow in and out of the heart and between the chambers. The valves can be thought of like water faucets. They either open up and allow blood to flow freely, or close and stop the flow entirely.
Your tricuspid valve is the valve that separates your right atrium and right ventricle. Tricuspid regurgitation occurs when this valve doesn�t properly close. This can cause blood to flow back up into the right atrium when the right ventricle contracts. Over time, this condition can weaken your heart.
Tricuspid regurgitation is also known as tricuspid valve insufficiency."
tricuspid valve insufficiency,tricuspid valve insufficiency symptoms,"Tricuspid regurgitation may not cause any recognizable symptoms at first. You�re more likely to experience symptoms if you also have pulmonary hypertension or high blood pressure.
Symptoms of tricuspid regurgitation include:
abdominal swelling
decreased urine output
foot and ankle swelling
general weakness
an irregular heart rhythm
swelling in the body
pulsing in your neck vein
unexplained fatigue"
tricuspid valve insufficiency,tricuspid valve insufficiency causes,"There are three main causes of tricuspid regurgitation:
Right ventricle dilation
The most common cause of tricuspid regurgitation is right ventricle dilation. The right ventricle is responsible for pumping blood from your heart to your lungs. When the right ventricle is forced to work extra hard at this task, it can dilate (or become larger) to compensate. This can cause the ring of tissue that support�s the tricuspid valve�s ability to open and close to dilate as well.
The enlargement can be a complication of many different disorders, including:
emphysema
pulmonary hypertension
left-side heart disorders
pulmonic stenosis
Infection
Infections can directly injure the tricuspid valve, eventually leading to tricuspid regurgitation. The most common of these infections is infective endocarditis.
Diet medications
The diet medications phentermine and fenfluramine � also known as �Fen-Phen� � have been linked to tricuspid regurgitation. These drugs, however, are now off the market and are no longer a common cause of tricuspid regurgitation.
Other causes
There are other possible causes of tricuspid regurgitation, although they are all fairly rare. They include:
certain injuries
carcinoid tumors
systemic lupus
birth defects of the valve
Ebstein�s anomaly (a congenital heart disease)
tricuspid valve prolapse
myxomatous degeneration
Marfan�s syndrome
rheumatic fever
rheumatoid arthritis"
tricuspid valve insufficiency,tricuspid valve insufficiency diagnosis,"Your doctor may suspect you have tricuspid regurgitation if you�re experiencing symptoms or if you have other diseases known to lead to the disorder.
During your appointment, your doctor will begin with a physical examination. Your doctor will also listen to your heart for the presence of a heart murmur. This abnormal heart sound can indicate that blood is flowing backward from the heart valve.
After listening to your heart, your doctor may order diagnostic tests. These can help your doctor visualize your heart�s valves. These tests may include:
electrocardiogram
chest X-ray
echocardiogram
transesophageal echocardiogram
cardiac catheterization
radionuclide scan
MRI"
tricuspid valve insufficiency,tricuspid valve insufficiency treatment,"Tricuspid regurgitation does not always need treatment. If your condition is not severe, your doctor may only recommend that you monitor your heart health at regular intervals to make sure the condition doesn�t progress.
Your doctor may prescribe a medication if you have an irregular heartbeat. Tricuspid regurgitation due to heart failure may be treated with medications that strengthen your heartbeat. Swelling can be treated with diuretics to promote the loss of fluids.
It may help to treat any underlying medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, to reduce the symptoms associated with tricuspid regurgitation.
In some instances, tricuspid regurgitation will require surgical repair. Surgeons also can replace the tricuspid valve."
tricuspid valve insufficiency,tricuspid valve insufficiency complications,"If left untreated, tricuspid regurgitation can increase your risk of heart failure. It may also lead to weight loss, appetite loss, and cirrhosis of the liver.
Those with tricuspid regurgitation are at a greater risk for endocarditis, an infection of the heart."
tricuspid valve insufficiency,tricuspid valve insufficiency prevention,"If you have a problem with your tricuspid valve, it�s important to take steps to reduce your risk of endocarditis.
Take good care of your teeth and gums.
Tell all your doctors and dentists that you have a valve disease.
Take antibiotics to prevent infection before any invasive medical procedure or dental work.
Alert your doctor if you experience symptoms of an infection, such as fever, sore throat, and body aches.
Talk to your doctor if you�re experiencing the symptoms of tricuspid regurgitation so you can help keep your heart healthy."
Alzheimer's disease,Alzheimer's disease definition,"What is Alzheimer�s disease?
Alzheimer�s disease is a progressive form of dementia. Dementia is a broader term for conditions that negatively affect memory, thinking, and behavior. The changes interfere with daily living. Dementia can have a range of causes, such as brain injuries or diseases. Sometimes the cause is unknown.
According to the Alzheimer�s Association, Alzheimer�s disease accounts for 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases. Most people with the disease get a diagnosis after age 65. If it�s diagnosed before then, it�s generally referred to as �younger onset� or �early onset� Alzheimer�s disease.
There�s no cure for Alzheimer�s, but there are treatments that can slow the progression of the disease."
Alzheimer's disease,Alzheimer's disease symptoms,"Everyone has episodes of forgetfulness from time to time. But people with Alzheimer�s disease display certain ongoing behaviors and symptoms that worsen over time. These can include:
memory loss affecting daily activities, such as keeping appointments
trouble with familiar tasks, such as using a microwave
difficulties with problem-solving
trouble with speech or writing
becoming disoriented about times or places
decreased judgment
decreased personal hygiene
mood and personality changes
withdrawal from friends, family, and community
These signs don�t always mean that a person has Alzheimer�s. It�s important to see a doctor to determine the cause.
Symptoms change according to the stage of the disease. In later stages, people with Alzheimer�s often have significant trouble with talking, moving, or responding to what�s happening around them."
Alzheimer's disease,Alzheimer's disease diagnosis,"The only definitive way to diagnose someone with Alzheimer�s disease is to examine their brain tissue after death. But a doctor can use other examinations and tests to assess your mental abilities, diagnose dementia, and rule out other conditions.
The doctor will likely start by taking a medical history. They may ask about your:
symptoms
family medical history
other current or past health conditions
current or past medications
diet, alcohol intake, and other lifestyle habits
From there, your doctor will likely request several tests to help determine if you have Alzheimer�s disease."
Alzheimer's disease,Alzheimer's disease treatment,"In addition to medication, lifestyle changes can help you manage your condition. For example, your doctor might develop strategies to help you or your loved one:
simplify tasks
limit confusion
get enough rest every day
use relaxation techniques
create a calming environment
Along with your doctor, a team of healthcare professionals can help you maintain your quality of life at all stages along the Alzheimer�s journey. A care team for Alzheimer�s may include a:
physical therapist, to help with staying active
dietician, to maintain a balanced, nutritious diet
pharmacist, to help with monitoring medications
mental health professional, who may work with the person with Alzheimer�s as well as their caregivers
social worker, to help with accessing resources and support
respite care center, to provide short-term care for someone with Alzheimer�s when their caregivers are temporarily unavailable
hospice care center, to manage symptoms in a comfortable and supportive setting at the end of life
Some studies
have suggested that vitamin E could help slow the loss of functioning in Alzheimer�s, especially when taken with medications like donepezil that increase acetylcholine in the brain. But other research found no benefits when taking vitamin E for Alzheimer�s disease. Overall, more evidence is needed.
Be sure to ask your doctor before taking vitamin E or any other supplements. It can interfere with some of the medications used to treat Alzheimer�s disease.
In addition to lifestyle changes, there are several alternative and complementary therapies you can ask your doctor about.
Dementia vs. Alzheimer�s
The terms �dementia� and �Alzheimer�s� are sometimes used interchangeably. However, these two conditions aren�t the same. Alzheimer�s is a type of dementia.
Dementia is a broader term for conditions with symptoms relating to memory loss, such as forgetfulness and confusion. Dementia includes more specific conditions, such as Alzheimer�s disease, Parkinson�s disease, traumatic brain injury, and others, which can cause these symptoms.
Causes, symptoms, and treatments can be different for these conditions.
Was this helpful?"
Alzheimer's disease,Alzheimer's disease causes,"Experts haven�t determined a single cause of Alzheimer�s disease, but they have identified certain risk factors, including:
Age. Most people who develop Alzheimer�s disease are 65 years of age or older.
Family history. If you have an immediate family member who has developed the condition, you�re more likely to get it.
Genetics. Certain genes have been linked to Alzheimer�s disease.
Having one or more of these risk factors doesn�t mean that you�ll develop Alzheimer�s disease. It simply raises your risk level.
Other possible risk factors include a history of:
depression
smoking
cardiovascular disease
previous traumatic brain injury
To learn more about your personal risk of developing Alzheimer�s, talk with your doctor."
Alzheimer's disease,Alzheimer's disease prevention,"Just as there�s no known cure for Alzheimer�s, there are no foolproof preventive measures. For now, health-promoting lifestyle habits are the best tools we have to prevent cognitive decline.
The following steps may help:
Try to quit smoking. If you smoke, quitting benefits your health both immediately and in the long term.
Exercise regularly. Getting active reduces the risk of many conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
Keep your brain active. Try some cognitive training exercises.
Eat well. Eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables.
Maintain an active social life. Friendships, volunteering, and hobbies are likely to benefit your overall health.
Be sure to talk with your doctor before making any big changes in your lifestyle."
candidiasis or oral candidiasis,candidiasis or oral candidiasis definition,"Thrush is a yeast (fungus) infection that commonly occurs in the mouths of babies and toddlers. It�s rarely serious but can pass between babies and nursing parents.
It�s typical for a small amount of fungus to live in your mouth. But in some cases, the fungus may rapidly multiply and lead to a yeast infection.
Oral thrush happens when this type of yeast infection develops inside your mouth. It�s also known as oral candidiasis, oropharyngeal candidiasis, or simply thrush.
Oral thrush is more common
in babies and older adults, who tend to have weaker immune systems. But it can occur at any age.
Read on to learn about oral thrush, what it can look like, who it affects, what causes it, and how it�s treated."
candidiasis or oral candidiasis,candidiasis or oral candidiasis symptoms,"In its early stages, oral thrush may not cause any symptoms. But as the infection gets worse, one or more of the following
symptoms may develop:
white or yellow spots on your inner cheeks, tongue, tonsils, gums, or lips
slight bleeding if the spots are scraped
soreness or burning in your mouth
a cotton-like sensation in your mouth
dry, cracked skin at the corners of your mouth
difficulty swallowing
a bad taste in your mouth
a loss of taste
redness, irritation, and pain under dentures (denture stomatitis)
In some cases, oral thrush can affect your esophagus, though this is uncommon. The same fungus that causes oral thrush can also cause yeast infections in other parts of your body.
Learn more about the symptoms of oral thrush.
What are the symptoms of oral thrush in babies?
Oral thrush most often affects infants and toddlers. About 65%
of infants have Candida albicans (C. albicans). fungus in their mouths. About 5-7% of babies under one month old will develop the infection.
Babies can contract the fungus from their birthing parent during pregnancy, delivery, or nursing or just from yeast that is naturally present in their environment.
If your baby has oral thrush, it may develop the same signs and symptoms that can affect adults with the condition. It may also cause difficulty feeding and irritability or fussiness.
Read more about thrush in babies, as well as thrush and breastfeeding or chestfeeding."
candidiasis or oral candidiasis,candidiasis or oral candidiasis causes,"Oral thrush and other yeast infections are caused by an overgrowth of C. albicans. It exists naturally in the microbiomes of 50%
of the population.
It�s typical for a small amount of C. albicans to live in your mouth without causing harm. When your immune system is working properly, beneficial bacteria in your body help keep C. albicans under control.
But if your immune system is compromised or the balance of microorganisms in your body is disrupted, the fungus can grow out of control."
candidiasis or oral candidiasis,candidiasis or oral candidiasis risks,"Oral thrush is the most common opportunistic infection in people living with HIV. It can also develop with other conditions or medications that weaken your immune system, such as:
cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy
cancer like leukemia
uncontrolled diabetes
Other risk factors include:
being a baby or older adult
having a condition that causes dry mouth
taking corticosteroids, or immunosuppressant drugs
smoking
wearing dentures
taking antibiotics"
candidiasis or oral candidiasis,candidiasis or oral candidiasis complications,"If your immune system is weakened, you�re more likely to develop complications from thrush.
Without proper treatment, the fungus that causes thrush may enter your bloodstream and spread to your heart, brain, eyes, or other body parts. This is known as invasive or systemic candidiasis.
Systemic candidiasis can cause problems in the organs it affects. It can also cause
a potentially life threatening condition known as septic shock."
candidiasis or oral candidiasis,candidiasis or oral candidiasis diagnosis,"Your doctor may be able to diagnose oral thrush simply by taking a history of your symptoms
and examining your mouth for the characteristic lesions that it causes.
They may do a biopsy of the affected area to confirm the diagnosis. They may also do a throat swab culture or endoscopy to see if you have a fungal infection in your throat or esophagus.
If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool."
candidiasis or oral candidiasis,candidiasis or oral candidiasis prevention,"To reduce your risk of oral thrush, try the following:
Avoid sharing cups and utensils with others.
Eat a nutritious diet and practice an overall healthy lifestyle to support the functioning of your immune system.
Practice good oral hygiene by brushing your teeth twice a day, flossing every day, and visiting your dentist on a regular basis.
If your mouth is chronically dry, make an appointment with your doctor and follow their recommended treatment plan.
If you have dentures, remove them before you go to bed, clean them daily, and ensure they fit properly.
If you have a corticosteroid inhaler, rinse out your mouth or brush your teeth after using it.
If you have diabetes, take steps to manage your blood sugar levels.
If you develop a yeast infection in another part of your body other than your mouth, get treatment. In some cases, an infection can spread from one part of your body to another.

neuropathy,neuropathy definition,"Peripheral neuropathy occurs when these nerves don�t work properly because they�re damaged or destroyed. They might send pain signals for no reason, or not send a signal when you�re experiencing harm.
Read on to learn about the types of peripheral neuropathy, its symptoms, causes, treatment, and more."
neuropathy,neuropathy symptoms,"There are three types of nerves in the body. Since there are so many types of peripheral neuropathy, doctors will diagnose your type by the group of nerves it affects. The three groups are:
Motor. These nerves are responsible for muscle movement, like walking, talking, or using your hands or arms.
Sensory. These are responsible for sensory information, like hot or cold, pain, or touch.
Autonomic. These are responsible for body processes you don�t see, like breathing, heartbeat, and digestion.
Peripheral neuropathy can affect one nerve group, two groups, or all three. Sometimes it will affect one nerve only, and that�s called mononeuropathy.
The symptoms of peripheral neuropathy depend on the kind of neuropathy.
Motor neuropathy symptoms include:
muscle cramps
twitching
muscle weakness
foot drop
muscle wasting
paralysis
Sensory neuropathy symptoms include:
prickling and tingling sensation, or �pins and needles�
numbness
reduced sensations of pain or hot and cold
increased pain from things that shouldn�t cause pain, like light touch
burning or sharp pain
loss of balance or coordination
Autonomic neuropathy symptoms include:
constipation or diarrhea
bloating, belching, or feeling of sickness
faint or dizziness upon standing from low blood pressure
rapid heart rate
sweating too much or too little
problems with sexual function
loss of bowel control
difficulty emptying bladder completely
Symptoms can cause challenges in daily life, like trouble walking or sleeping because of pain in the feet and legs.
These symptoms can also indicate other conditions. Make sure you tell your doctor about all of your symptoms so they can find the right diagnosis and the best treatment."
neuropathy,neuropathy causes,"A variety of factors and underlying conditions can cause
this condition. In rare cases, peripheral neuropathy is genetic, but most cases are acquired.
An acquired case of peripheral neuropathy is often idiopathic, which means doctors don�t know why it�s happening. In most cases, doctors can connect the condition to one or more causes.
Generalized diseases
Nerve damage caused by diabetes is one of the most common forms of neuropathy. This leads to numbness, pain, and a loss of sensation in the extremities.
The American Diabetes Association recommends taking these steps to delay or prevent nerve damage:
Monitor your blood sugar level to keep it in target range and to assess whether your diabetes care plan is on track.
Inspect your feet for signs of injury, infection, or hot spots.
Report signs of neuropathy to your doctor and get early treatment.
Protect your feet with special shoes and take care when washing and exercising.
According to the National Institutes of Health, 60 to 70 percent
of people with diabetes have some sort of nerve damage.
Other chronic diseases that may cause nerve damage include:
autoimmune diseases like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis
kidney or liver disorders
vascular and blood disorders
Injury
Physical trauma is a common cause of injury to the nerves. This can include car accidents, falls, or fractures. Inactivity, or holding still too long in one position, can also cause neuropathy.
Increased pressure on the median nerve, a nerve in the wrist that supplies feeling and movement to the hand, causes carpal tunnel syndrome. This is a common type
of peripheral neuropathy.
Alcohol and toxins
Alcohol can have a toxic effect on nerve tissue, putting people with severe alcohol use disorder at a higher risk of peripheral neuropathy.
Exposure to toxic chemicals like glue, solvents, or insecticides, either through chemical abuse or in the workplace, can also cause nerve damage. Additionally, exposure to heavy metals such as lead and mercury can also cause this condition.
Infections and autoimmune disorders
Certain viruses and bacteria directly attack nerve tissue.
Viruses such as herpes simplex, varicella-zoster virus (which causes chickenpox and shingles), and Epstein-Barr virus damage sensory nerves and cause intense episodes of shooting pain.
Bacterial infections such as Lyme disease can also cause nerve damage and pain if they aren�t treated. People with HIV or AIDS can also develop peripheral neuropathy.
Autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus affect the peripheral nervous system in various ways. Chronic inflammation and damage to tissues throughout the body, as well as pressure caused by inflammation, can all lead to severe nerve pain in the extremities.
Medications
Certain medications may also cause nerve damage. These include:
anticonvulsants, which people take to treat seizures
drugs to fight bacterial infections
some blood pressure medications
medications used to treat cancer
A 2020 study found that although there�s no direct evidence that statins, a class of drugs used to lower cholesterol and prevent cardiovascular disease, cause neuropathy, statins may increase the risk of neuropathy from other causes."
neuropathy,neuropathy diagnosis,"First, your doctor will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history. They might perform
other tests, which include:
Electromyography
Electromyography can show problems with how your body�s nerve signals move to your muscles.
For this test, your doctor will place a small needle into your muscle. Your doctor will then ask you to move your muscle gently. Probes in the needle will measure the amount of electricity moving through your muscle.
This test may feel like you�re receiving a shot. Sometimes the area becomes sore for a few days afterward.
Nerve conduction study
In a nerve conduction study, your doctor places electrodes on your skin. They then pulse tiny amounts of electricity through your nerves to see if the nerves are transmitting signals properly.
This procedure is slightly uncomfortable while it�s happening, but it shouldn�t hurt afterward.
If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here."
neuropathy,neuropathy treatment,"Treatment for the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy focuses on treating
the underlying disorder. If diabetes is the cause, the focus is on blood sugar control. If a vitamin deficiency is causing the problem, then correcting the deficiency is the treatment.
Many treatments can bring relief and help you return to your regular activities. Sometimes a combination of treatments works best.
Pain medications
Over-the-counter (OTC) oral pain medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, can be very helpful in controlling moderate pain.
If you take them in excess, these drugs can affect your liver or stomach function. It�s important to avoid using them for an extended period, especially if you drink alcohol regularly.
The Foundation for Peripheral Neuropathy includes a list of additional topical OTC medications you may consider trying. They include:
Absorbine Jr. This is a blend of menthol and other herbal ingredients that can soothe muscle pain. Other menthol-based creams may also help. They include Flex-All, Flexgen, Tiger Balm, or Vicks VapoRub.
Capsaicin cream. This cream contains chili pepper oils, which create a heating effect that helps relieve pain for some people. There are brands and formulations.
Neuragen PN. Made from botanical oils, this cream is meant specifically for nerve pain on hands and feet.
Sore No More. This is another botanical anesthetic that may provide some relieve for neuropathic discomfort.
Prescription medication
Many prescription pain medications can also help to control the pain of this condition. These include narcotics, some antiepileptic medications, and some antidepressants. Other helpful prescription medications include:
lidocaine in a patch on the affected area
pregabalin (an anti-epileptic medication)
duloxetine (an antidepressant)
steroids
anesthetics
Prescription drugs for sexual dysfunction in men due to nerve damage include phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5Is) like:
sildenafil
vardenafil
tadalafil
avanafil
Medical treatments
Your doctor can use several medical treatments to control the symptoms of this condition. Plasmapheresis is a blood transfusion that removes potentially irritating antibodies from your bloodstream.
If you get a nerve block, your doctor will inject an anesthetic directly into your nerves.
Transcutaneous electronic nerve stimulation (TENS)
Transcutaneous electronic nerve stimulation (TENS) doesn�t work for everyone, but many people like it because it�s a drug-free therapy.
During TENS, electrodes placed on the skin send small amounts of electricity into the skin. The goal of this treatment is to disrupt nerves from transmitting pain signals to the brain.
Ergonomic casts or splints
Ergonomic casts or splints can help you if your neuropathy affects your muscles. Splints can help with:
muscle weakness
stability
These casts provide support for the part of your body that�s uncomfortable. This can relieve pain. For example, a cast or splint that holds your wrists in a proper position while you sleep can relieve the discomfort of carpal tunnel syndrome.
Self-care
In addition to OTC pain relievers, many people have found relief for peripheral neuropathy through:
having a foot bath with chamomile or nettle leaves for at least 30 minutes
using a heating pad or electric socks
applying an ice pack to affected areas for 10 minutes twice daily in the morning and the evening
trying acupuncture
undergoing biofeedback
trying different types of holistic therapy such as reflexology, tai chi, or reiki
massaging affected areas to promote circulation
avoiding pressure on the affected area, like not crossing legs or leaning on elbows
seeking social support and activities with others
setting priorities daily and not doing more than you feel you are capable of
avoiding caffeine and developing a regular bedtime routine to promote sleep
Moderate, regular exercise can also help lessen discomfort.
If you drink alcohol or smoke, consider cutting back or stopping. Both alcohol and tobacco aggravate nerve pain and can cause nerve damage when used for long periods.
Take precautions at home
If you have peripheral neuropathy, you�re potentially at greater risk for accidents in the home. You can do the following to improve your safety:
Use safety guards and other tools for sharp objects like scissors and knives.
Use thermometers to measure the temperature of bath or tap water.
Use potholders and gloves when handling hot items.
Use a walker or cane for added stability.
Install nightlights to avoid tripping in the dark.
Carefully wrap your hands and feet when it�s cold out."
neuropathy,neuropathy prevention,"You can take steps to prevent
peripheral neuropathy and lower your risk by:
talking with your doctor about genetic risk and steps to prevent onset of hereditary neuropathy
asking about medications that have lower neuropathy risk
getting vaccinated for conditions like shingles that can cause neuropathy
treating the underlying cause of neuropathy, like managing blood sugar if you have diabetes
quitting smoking to promote healthy circulation
avoiding caffeine to improve sleep
Eating healthy to prevent vitamin deficiency and support vascular health is of particular importance. Keeping a balanced diet that includes all the food groups is your best course of action.
However, the Foundation for Peripheral Neuropathy has a list of some specific nutrients and vitamins to look out for in your food that may play a role in improving some symptoms
If you have diabetes, take special care of your feet. Wash and inspect your feet daily, and keep the skin moist with lotion."
kidney disease,kidney disease definition,"Kidney failure occurs when your kidneys lose the ability to filter waste from your blood sufficiently. It may not cause symptoms in the early stages.
Your kidneys filter your blood and remove toxins from your body. These toxins go to your bladder and are eliminated when you urinate. When this doesn�t work properly, you can get kidney failure.
If your kidneys aren�t able to function properly, toxins can overwhelm your body. This can lead to kidney failure, which can be life threatening if left untreated.
Keep reading as we break down everything you need to know about kidney failure, including symptoms, stages, treatment, and the typical outlook."
kidney disease,kidney disease symptoms,"Early-stage kidney failure often doesn�t cause noticeable symptoms. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
, about 90% of people with chronic kidney disease don�t know they have it.
As kidney disease progresses, symptoms may include:
reduced amount of urine
swelling of your legs, ankles, and feet from fluid retention
shortness of breath
trouble sleeping
muscle cramping at night
excessive drowsiness or fatigue
persistent nausea
confusion
chest pain or pressure
seizures
coma
Early signs of kidney failure
Symptoms of early-stage kidney disease may be subtle and hard to identify. They may include:
decreased urine output
swelling in limbs
shortness of breath
Kidney failure urine color
The color of your urine doesn�t tell you much about the state of your kidney function until damage to the kidneys has progressed.
Still, urine color changes may be an early indicator of some issues.
Urine color Indication
clear or pale yellow well-hydrated
dark yellow or amber dehydrated
orange dehydration or bile in the bloodstream
pink or red blood in the urine or having eaten certain foods, like beets
foamy contains a lot of protein; potentially an indicator of kidney disease"
kidney disease,kidney disease causes,"Kidney failure can result from various causes. According to the National Kidney Foundation, the two most common include high blood pressure and diabetes.
People who are most at risk usually have one or more of the following:
Loss of blood flow to the kidneys
A sudden loss of blood flow to your kidneys can prompt kidney failure. Some causes include:
heart attack
heart disease
scarring of the liver or liver failure
dehydration
severe burns
allergic reactions
severe infection, such as sepsis
High blood pressure and anti-inflammatory medications can also limit blood flow.
Urine elimination problems
When your body can�t eliminate urine, toxins build up and overload the kidneys. Some cancers can block the urine passageways, such as:
prostate
colon
cervical
bladder
Other conditions can interfere with urination and possibly lead to kidney failure, including:
kidney stones
enlarged prostate
blood clots within your urinary tract
damage to the nerves that control your bladder
Other causes
Other factors that may lead to kidney failure include:
a blood clot in or around your kidneys
heavy metal poisoning
drugs and alcohol use
vasculitis, an inflammation of the blood vessels
lupus, an autoimmune disease that can cause inflammation of many body organs
glomerulonephritis, an inflammation of the small blood vessels of the kidneys
hemolytic uremic syndrome, which involves the breakdown of red blood cells following a bacterial infection, usually of the intestines
multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cells in your bone marrow
scleroderma, an autoimmune condition that affects your skin
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a disorder that causes blood clots in small vessels
chemotherapy drugs that treat cancer and some autoimmune diseases
dyes used in some imaging tests
certain antibiotics
unmanaged diabetes"
kidney disease,kidney disease diagnosis,"Doctors use several tests to diagnose kidney failure. Common tests include:
Urinalysis: A urine sample can show how much protein or sugar is in your urine. A urinary sediment examination looks for red and white blood cells, high levels of bacteria, and high numbers of cellular casts.
Urine volume measurements: Measuring urine output can help diagnose kidney failure. Low output may suggest that kidney disease is due to a urinary blockage.
Blood samples: Blood tests can measure substances filtered by your kidneys, such as blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. A rapid rise in these levels may indicate acute kidney failure.
Imaging: Tests like ultrasounds, MRIs, and CT scans provide images of your kidneys and urinary tract to identify issues.
Kidney tissue sample: Doctors use a kidney biopsy to collect and examine tissue samples."
kidney disease,kidney disease treatment,"The type of treatment you need depends on the cause and stage of your kidney failure.
Dialysis
Dialysis filters and purifies the blood using a machine to performs the function of the kidneys. Depending on the type of dialysis, you may be connected to a large machine or a portable catheter bag.
Along with dialysis, you may need to follow a low potassium, low salt diet.
Dialysis doesn�t cure kidney failure, but going to regularly scheduled treatments can extend your life.
Kidney transplant
A transplanted kidney can work fully, so you no longer need dialysis.
There�s usually a long wait to receive a donor kidney that�s compatible with your body. If you have a living donor, the process may go more quickly.
Transplant surgery might not be the right treatment option for everyone. It is not always successful.
You must take immunosuppressant drugs after the surgery to prevent your body from rejecting the new kidney. These drugs have their own side effects, some of which can be serious.
You can talk with a doctor about whether you�re a good candidate for a kidney transplant.
Lifestyle modifications
Minimizing your intake of alcohol and making dietary changes may help prevent kidney failure from progressing.
At the early stages and beyond, it�s possible to manage and slow progression with lifestyle factors such as:
Dietary changes
The guidelines for what you eat will often depend on the stage of kidney disease you have and your overall health. Some recommendations might include:
Limiting sodium and potassium: Aim to eat less than 2,000 milligrams per day of both sodium (salt) and potassium.
Limiting phosphorus: Try to stay below 1,000 milligrams
of phosphorus.
Following protein guidelines: In early and moderate kidney disease, you might want to cut back on protein consumption. But you may eat more protein in end-stage kidney failure, depending on your doctor�s recommendations.
Beyond these general guidelines, a doctor may also ask you to avoid certain foods.
Lowering alcohol intake
If you have kidney failure and drink alcohol, your kidneys must work harder than they already do. Alcohol doesn�t metabolize out of your system, so if you have complete kidney failure, you�ll feel its effects until you receive dialysis to filter it from your blood.
Beer, ale, and wine also contain large amounts of phosphorous. Severe heart issues and death are possible if your kidneys cannot filter it out.
If you have kidney failure or late-stage kidney disease, a doctor may recommend you limit alcohol. Eliminating alcohol from your diet, if possible, may be best."
kidney disease,kidney disease complications,"Kidney failure can lead to various complications. These can include:
anemia
bone weakness, due to an imbalance of phosphorus and calcium
fluid retention (edema)
heart disease
high potassium levels (hyperkalemia)
metabolic acidosis, when the blood becomes too acidic
Many people with kidney failure develop secondary complications. These can include:
depression
liver failure
fluid buildup in the lungs
gout
nerve damage
skin infections"
kidney disease,kidney disease prevention,"You can take steps to lower the risk of kidney failure.
Follow directions when taking over-the-counter medications. Taking doses that are too high, even of common drugs like aspirin, can create high toxin levels quickly. This can overload your kidneys.
Many kidney or urinary tract conditions lead to kidney failure without prompt treatment.
You can help lower your risk of kidney failure by:
eating a balanced diet
maintaining a moderate weight
taking prescribed and over-the-counter medications as directed and not taking more medication than is safe
keeping conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, well managed and following a doctor�s advice"
glaucoma,glaucoma definition,"What Is Glaucoma?
Glaucoma is an eye disease that can damage your optic nerve. The optic nerve supplies visual information to your brain from your eyes.
Glaucoma is usually, but not always, the result of abnormally high pressure inside your eye. Over time, the increased pressure can erode your optic nerve tissue, which may lead to vision loss or even blindness. If it�s caught early, you may be able to prevent additional vision loss."
glaucoma,glaucoma symptoms,"The most common type of glaucoma is primary open-angle glaucoma. It has no signs or symptoms except gradual vision loss. For that reason, it�s important that you go to yearly comprehensive eye exams so your ophthalmologist, or eye specialist, can monitor any changes in your vision.
Acute-angle closure glaucoma, which is also known as narrow-angle glaucoma, is a medical emergency. See your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms:
severe eye pain
nausea
vomiting
redness in your eye
sudden vision disturbances
seeing colored rings around lights
sudden blurred vision"
glaucoma,glaucoma causes,"The back of your eye continuously makes a clear fluid called aqueous humor. As this fluid is made, it fills the front part of your eye. Then, it leaves your eye through channels in your cornea and iris. If these channels are blocked or partially obstructed, the natural pressure in your eye, which is called the intraocular pressure (IOP), may increase. As your IOP increases, your optic nerve may become damaged. As damage to your nerve progresses, you may begin losing sight in your eye.
What causes the pressure in your eye to increase isn�t always known. However, doctors believe one or more of these factors may play a role:
dilating eye drops
blocked or restricted drainage in your eye
medications, such as corticosteroids
poor or reduced blood flow to your optic nerve
high or elevated blood pressure"
glaucoma,glaucoma risks,"According to the World Health Organization
(WHO), glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness around the world. The risk factors for glaucoma include:
Age
People over 60 are at increased risk of glaucoma, warns the NEI
, and the risk of glaucoma increases slightly with each year of age. If you�re African-American, your increase in risk begins at age 40.
Ethnicity
African-Americans or people of African descent are significantly more likely to develop glaucoma than Caucasians. People of Asian descent are at a higher risk of angle-closure glaucoma, and people of Japanese descent have a higher risk of developing low-tension glaucoma.
Eye Problems
Chronic eye inflammation and thin corneas can lead to increased pressure in your eyes. Physical injury or trauma to your eye, such as being hit in your eye, can also cause your eye pressure to increase.
Family History
Some types of glaucoma may run in families. If your parent or grandparent had open-angle glaucoma, you�re at an increased risk of developing the condition.
Medical History
People with diabetes and those with high blood pressure and heart disease have an increased risk of developing glaucoma.
Use of Certain Medicine
Using corticosteroids for extended periods may increase your risk of developing secondary glaucoma."
glaucoma,glaucoma diagnosis,"To diagnose glaucoma, your ophthalmologist will want to perform a comprehensive eye examination. They�ll check for signs of deterioration, including loss of nerve tissue. They may also use one or more of the following tests and procedures:
Detailed Medical History
Your doctor will want to know what symptoms you�ve been experiencing and if you have any personal or family history of glaucoma. They�ll also ask for a general health assessment to determine if any other health conditions may be impacting your eye health, such as diabetes or high blood pressure.
Tonometry Test
This class of tests measures your eye�s internal pressure.
Pachymetry Test
People with thin corneas have an increased risk of developing glaucoma. A pachymetry test can tell your doctor if your corneas are thinner than average.
Perimetry Test
This test, also known as a visual field test, can tell your doctor if glaucoma is affecting your vision by measuring your peripheral, or side, vision and your central vision.
Monitoring Your Optic Nerve
If your doctor wants to monitor for gradual changes to your optic nerve, they may take photographs of your optic nerve to conduct a side-by-side comparison over time."
glaucoma,glaucoma prevention,"Glaucoma can�t be prevented, but it�s still important to catch it early so you can begin treatment that will help prevent it from getting worse. The best way to catch any type of glaucoma early is to have an annual preventive eye care appointment. Make an appointment with an ophthalmologist. Simple tests performed during these routine eye checks may be able to detect damage from glaucoma before it advances and begins causing vision loss."
neoplasm metastasis,neoplasm metastasis definition,"Metastatic cancer is cancer that has spread from its original location to a distant part of the body. Most metastatic cancers are not curable, although people with well-controlled metastatic cancer can live for many years.
Metastatic cancers are serious and difficult to treat. While most are incurable, they can be managed for months or even years with the right treatment. And certain kinds of metastatic cancer, such as testicular cancer, can be curable.
This article takes a closer look at metastatic cancers, where they�re likely to spread, and why the outlook for people with metastatic cancers can vary so much."
neoplasm metastasis,neoplasm metastasis symptoms,"Cancer can spread almost anywhere, but different types of cancer tend to spread to certain places. The following are the most common
sites of metastasis, according to the National Cancer Institute:
Metastatic cancer type Main sites of metastasis
bladder bone, liver, lung
breast bone, brain, liver, lung
colon liver, lung, peritoneum (the membrane that lines your abdominal cavity)
kidney adrenal gland, bone, brain, liver, lung

Fatigue and weight loss are among the general symptoms of metastatic cancer. Other symptoms depend on the site of metastasis, such as:
Bone: pain, easily fractured bones
Brain: headache, dizziness, vision problems, seizures
Lung: shortness of breath, cough, chest pain
Liver: jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), bloating, abdominal pain
The number and size of tumors can also affect the symptoms."
neoplasm metastasis,neoplasm metastasis diagnosis,"Diagnosing metastatic cancer may involve imaging tests such as:
X-ray

A biopsy of a tumor can help identify the type of cancer."
malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon,malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon definition,"Colon cancer occurs when cells in your large intestine and rectum grow out of control. Treatment can vary by the stage and type of colon cancer.
Colon cancer is a type of cancer that starts in your colon (large intestine) or rectum. Your colon and rectum are the organs that make up the lower portion of your digestive system.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
, colon cancer � also known as colorectal cancer � is the third most common type of cancer in the United States when certain common skin cancers are excluded. In fact, the American Cancer Society (ACS)
estimates that about 1 in 23 men and 1 in 25 women will develop colorectal cancer during their lifetime.
The symptoms, treatment, and outlook for colon cancer will generally depend on the stage your cancer is in when you�re first diagnosed.
Learn more about colon cancer stages, causes, and risk factors � plus resources to help you find support."
malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon,malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon symptoms,"You might not experience colon cancer symptoms at all, especially in the early stages. If you do experience symptoms in stages 0 through 2, they�ll often include:
constipation
diarrhea
changes in stool color
changes in stool shape, such as narrowed stool
blood in the stool
bleeding from the rectum
excessive gas
abdominal cramps
abdominal pain
Many of these symptoms can also be caused by other, less serious, conditions. However, it�s a good idea to see a doctor if you�ve had any of these symptoms for longer than a week or two. You and your doctor can talk about your symptoms and decide if colon cancer screening is appropriate.
Stage 3 or 4 symptoms (late-stage symptoms)
Colon cancer symptoms are more noticeable in stages 3 and 4. In addition to the above symptoms, you might also experience:
excessive fatigue
unexplained weakness
unintentional weight loss
changes in your stool that last longer than a month
a feeling that your bowels won�t completely empty

malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon,malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon causes,"Researchers are still studying the causes of colon cancer.
Cancer may be caused by genetic mutations that can either be inherited or acquired. These mutations don�t guarantee you�ll develop colon cancer, but they do increase your chances.
Some mutations may cause abnormal cells to accumulate in the lining of the colon, forming polyps. These are small, benign growths. However, untreated polyps can become cancerous. Removing these growths through surgery can be a preventive measure."
malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon,malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon risks,"There are some risk factors that can increase your chances of developing colon cancer. Having one of these risk factors doesn�t automatically mean you�ll get colon cancer, but it does make it more likely than if you had no risk factors.
Risk factors you can�t change
Some factors that increase your risk of developing colon cancer can�t be changed. For instance, your age, ethnicity, and family health history can all impact your risk of colon cancer.
Risk factors you can�t control include:
being over 50
a prior history of colon polyps
a prior history of bowel diseases
a family history of colorectal cancer
having certain genetic syndromes, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)
being of African or Ashkenazi Jewish descent
Risk factors you can avoid
Other risk factors are avoidable. This means you can change them to decrease your risk of developing colon cancer. Avoidable risk factors include:
being overweight or having obesity
being a smoker
being a heavy drinker
having type 2 diabetes
having a sedentary lifestyle
consuming a diet high in processed meats"
malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon,malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon diagnosis,"An early diagnosis of colon cancer gives you the best chance of curing it. Since colon cancer often has no symptoms during the early stages, it is often caught during routine screenings.
The US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) and the ACS
now recommend colon cancer screening starting at 45, in light of younger people getting diagnosed with colon cancer.
The American College of Gastroenterology recommends that people start colon cancer screening at 40 years old.
Your doctor will start by getting information about your medical and family history. They�ll also perform a physical exam. They may press on your abdomen or perform a rectal exam to determine whether lumps or polyps are present.
Fecal testing
The ACS
recommends yearly fecal testing. Fecal tests are used to detect hidden blood in your stool. There are two main types, the guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) and the fecal immunochemical test (FIT).
Guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT)
Guaiac is a plant-based substance used to coat a special card that your stool sample is placed upon. If any blood is present in your stool, the card will change color.
You�ll have to avoid certain foods and medications, such as red meat and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), before this test. They may interfere with your test results.
Fecal immunochemical test (FIT)
The FIT detects hemoglobin, a protein found in the blood. It�s considered more precise than the guaiac-based test.
That�s because the FIT is unlikely to detect bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract (a type of bleeding that is rarely caused by colorectal cancer). Additionally, the results of this test aren�t affected by foods and medications.
At-home tests
Because multiple stool samples are needed for these tests, your doctor will likely provide you with test kits to use at home.
You can also buy at-home test kits from companies such as LetsGetChecked and Everlywell.
These kits often require you to send a stool sample off to a lab for evaluation. Your test results should be available online within 5 business days. Afterward, you�ll have the option to consult with a medical care team about your test results.
The Second Generation FIT can also be purchased online, but the stool sample doesn�t have to be sent to a lab. Test results are available within 5 minutes. This test is accurate, FDA-approved, and able to detect additional conditions such as colitis. However, there�s no medical care team to consult with if you have questions about your results.
Blood tests
Your doctor may run blood tests to get a better idea of what�s causing your symptoms. Liver function tests and complete blood counts can rule out other diseases and disorders.
Sigmoidoscopy
Minimally invasive, sigmoidoscopy allows your doctor to examine your sigmoid colon, the last section of your colon, for abnormalities. The procedure, also known as flexible sigmoidoscopy, involves a flexible tube with a light on it.
The USPSTF recommends a flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, or every 10 years along with a yearly FIT test.
The ACS
recommends a flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years.
Colonoscopy
A colonoscopy involves the use of a long tube with a small camera attached. This procedure allows your doctor to see inside your colon and rectum to check for anything unusual. It�s usually performed after less invasive screening tests indicate that you might have colon cancer.
During a colonoscopy, your doctor can also remove tissue from abnormal areas. These tissue samples can then be sent to a laboratory for analysis.
Out of the existing diagnostic methods, sigmoidoscopies and colonoscopies are the most effective at detecting benign growths that may develop into colon cancer.
The USPSTF and the ACS
recommend a colonoscopy every 10 years.
X-ray
Your doctor may order an X-ray using a contrast solution that contains the chemical element barium.
Your doctor inserts this liquid into your bowels through the use of a barium enema. Once in place, the barium solution coats the lining of the colon. This helps improve the quality of the X-ray images.
CT scan
CT scans provide your doctor with a detailed image of your colon. A CT scan that�s used to diagnose colon cancer is sometimes called a virtual colonoscopy.

malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon,malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon treatment,"Treatment of colon cancer depends on a variety of factors. A doctor will determine the best treatment plan for you based on your overall health and the stage of your colon cancer.
Surgery
In the earliest stages of colon cancer, it�s often possible for your surgeon to remove cancerous polyps through surgery. If the polyp hasn�t attached to the wall of the bowels, you�ll likely have an excellent outlook.
Your surgeon may need to remove a portion of the colon or rectum and the neighboring lymph nodes If your cancer has spread into your bowel walls. Your surgeon might be able to reattach the remaining healthy portion of the colon to the rectum. If this isn�t possible, they may perform a colostomy. This involves creating an opening in the abdominal wall for the removal of waste. A colostomy may be temporary or permanent.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy involves the use of drugs to kill cancer cells. For people with colon cancer, chemotherapy commonly takes place after surgery and is used to destroy lingering cancerous cells. Chemotherapy also controls the growth of tumors.
Chemotherapy drugs used to treat colon cancer include:
capecitabine (Xeloda)
fluorouracil
oxaliplatin (Eloxatin)
irinotecan (Camptosar)
Chemotherapy often comes with side effects that need to be controlled with additional medication.
Radiation
Radiation uses a powerful beam of energy, similar to that used in X-rays, to target and destroy cancerous cells before and after surgery. Radiation therapy commonly occurs alongside chemotherapy.
Other medications
Targeted therapies and immunotherapies may also be recommended. Drugs that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat colon cancer include:
bevacizumab (Avastin)
ramucirumab (Cyramza)
ziv-aflibercept (Zaltrap)
cetuximab (Erbitux)
panitumumab (Vectibix)
regorafenib (Stivarga)
pembrolizumab (Keytruda)
nivolumab (Opdivo)
ipilimumab (Yervoy)
They can treat metastatic, or late-stage, colon cancer that doesn�t respond to other types of treatment and has spread to other parts of the body."
malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon,malignant tumor of colon or carcinoma colon prevention,"Certain risk factors for colon cancer, such as family history and age, aren�t preventable.
However, lifestyle factors that may contribute to colon cancer are preventable, and changing them might help lower your overall risk of developing this disease.
You can take steps now to reduce your risk by:
decreasing the amount of red meat you eat
avoiding processed meats, such as hot dogs and deli meats
eating more plant-based foods
decreasing dietary fat
exercising daily
losing weight, if your doctor recommends it
quitting smoking
reducing alcohol consumption
decreasing stress
managing preexisting diabetes
Another preventive measure? Getting a colonoscopy or other cancer screening when you turn 45 years old. The earlier the cancer is detected, the better the outcome."
ketoacidosis diabetic,ketoacidosis diabetic definition,Diabetic ketoacidosis occurs when a person with diabetes type 1 or 2 has dangerously high levels of ketones in the body. It can be a medical emergency.
ketoacidosis diabetic,ketoacidosis diabetic symptoms,"Symptoms of DKA can appear quickly.
Early symptoms of DKA can include:
frequent urination
extreme thirst or dry mouth
high blood sugar levels, also known as hyperglycemia
high levels of ketones in the urine
As DKA progresses, more symptoms may appear:
nausea or vomiting
abdominal pain
confusion
fruity-smelling breath
flushed face
fatigue or weakness
rapid breathing
dry skin
loss of consciousness, also known as fainting or syncope
DKA is a medical emergency. Call your local emergency services immediately if you think you may be experiencing DKA.
If left untreated, DKA can lead to a coma or death. If you use insulin, make sure you discuss the risk of DKA with your healthcare team and have a plan in place.
If you have type 1 diabetes and have a blood sugar reading of over 240 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), you should test yourself for ketones using a urine or blood test.
You should also test if you are sick or planning on exercising and your blood sugar is 240 mg/dL or higher.
Call your doctor if moderate or high levels of ketones are present. Always seek medical help if you suspect you are progressing to DKA.
People with type 2 diabetes are usually at lower risk of DKA. But the risk can increase when your body is under strain due to injury, infection, or surgery.
When to get emergency help
If you have any of the following symptoms, and you can�t reach your doctor, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
recommends getting emergency help right away:
a blood sugar level that stays at 300 mg/dL or higher
breath that smells fruity
severe vomiting, where you can�t keep food or drinks down
difficulty breathing
multiple symptoms of DKA
Get help by calling local emergency services or having someone take you to the nearest emergency room.

ketoacidosis diabetic,ketoacidosis diabetic causes,"DKA occurs when insulin levels are low. Our bodies need insulin to use the available glucose in the blood. In DKA, glucose can�t get into the cells, so it builds up, resulting in high blood sugar levels.
In response, the body starts breaking down fat into a useable fuel that doesn�t require insulin. Turning fat into energy produces ketones. When too many ketones build up, your blood becomes acidic. This is diabetic ketoacidosis.
The most common causes of DKA are:
missing an insulin injection or not injecting enough insulin
illness or infection
a clog in your insulin pump, if you use one"
ketoacidosis diabetic,ketoacidosis diabetic risks,"Risk factors for DKA include:
having type 1 diabetes
being a younger age, as research suggests 63 percent of DKA cases happen in people below the age of 51
physiologic shock, a life threatening condition caused by interrupted blood flow
emotional or psychological stress
acute cardiovascular disease, such as heart attack or stroke
acute gastrointestical illness, such as pancreatitis
having an alcohol use or drug use disorder
having an eating disorder
certain endocrine conditions, such as Cushing syndrome and hyperthyroidism
recent surgery

Ketosis-prone diabetes
Although DKA is less common in people who have type 2 diabetes, it does occur. Some people with type 2 diabetes are considered �ketosis-prone� and are at a higher risk of DKA. A diagnosis of ketosis-prone diabetes is more likely
for:
Black (African American, Afro Caribbean, and sub-Saharan African), Asian (Chinese, Indian, and Japanese), and Hispanic people
people who have overweight or obesity
people who are middle-aged
males
It�s best to talk with your doctor about your risk factors to make sure you have the right treatment plan in place."
ketoacidosis diabetic,ketoacidosis diabetic diagnosis,"A doctor will likely do a test to confirm the presence of ketones in your urine. They will usually also test your blood sugar level. Other tests your doctor may order include:
basic bloodwork, including potassium and sodium, to assess metabolic function
arterial blood gas, where blood is drawn from an artery to determine its acidity
blood pressure
electrocardiogram (ECG)
chest X-ray or other tests to look for signs of an infection, such as pneumonia"
ketoacidosis diabetic,ketoacidosis diabetic prevention,"There are many ways to prevent DKA. Prevention means following your diabetes treatment plan carefully and taking some extra care when you�re sick.
Follow your treatment plan
You can lower your risk of DKA with proper management of your diabetes:
Take your medications as directed, even if you�re feeling fine.
Follow your meal plan.
Test your blood sugar consistently, as recommended by your doctor. This will help you get in the habit of making sure your numbers are in range. If you notice a problem, you can talk with your doctor about adjusting your treatment plan.
Talk with your doctor about adjusting your insulin dosage levels based on your activity level, illnesses, or other factors, such as what you�re eating.
If you have high blood sugar and your blood or urine test detects ketones, do not exercise. Exercising with high blood sugar can be dangerous when you have diabetes. It�s best to talk with your doctor about how to manage this situation.
Sometimes the cost of insulin can make it more difficult
to follow a diabetes treatment plan. Read more about how to access insulin at a reduced cost.
When you�re sick
Although you can�t completely avoid illness or infection, you can take steps to help you remember to take your insulin and to help prevent and plan for a DKA emergency.
A �sick day plan� can reduce the risk of DKA:
Test for ketone levels when you�re sick. This can help you catch mild to moderate ketone levels before they threaten your health.
Set an alarm if you take your medication at the same time every day, or use a reminder tool like a phone app.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist if it�s okay to prefill your syringe or syringes in the morning. That will help you easily see if you missed a dose.
Take the medications advised by your healthcare team to treat fever or infection.
Have soft or liquid foods available that are easier to eat if you become nauseous.
If there�s someone helping to care for you when you�re sick at home, make sure they have information about your diabetes treatment plan, including your medication and testing schedules.
Call your doctor if you detect moderate or high ketones in a home test. If you can�t reach your doctor and you suspect you may be progressing to DKA, get emergency help. Early detection is essential."
tonic-clonic epilepsy or tonic-clonic seizures,tonic-clonic epilepsy or tonic-clonic seizures definition,"Tonic seizures cause sudden stiffness and rigidity in your muscles. They typically last less than 1 minute.
Seizures are rapid bursts of electrical activity in your brain that can cause involuntary movement and a loss of awareness or consciousness. There are different classifications of seizures. These depend on factors like the part of your brain that�s affected and the symptoms the seizure causes.
Tonic seizures are characterized by sudden muscle stiffness in your limbs or torso. They can occur when you�re awake or asleep and usually last less than a minute
.
Anyone can have a seizure, but most people with recurrent seizures have a neurological condition known as epilepsy. Epilepsy exists on a spectrum. This means the type, frequency, and severity of seizures varies considerably between individuals.
About 11%
of people in the United States experience a seizure in their lifetime.
Read on to learn more about tonic seizures, including what causes them and how they differ from other types of seizures."
tonic-clonic epilepsy or tonic-clonic seizures,tonic-clonic epilepsy or tonic-clonic seizures causes,"Like other types of seizures, tonic seizures are caused by abnormal surges of electrical information in your brain. There are many potential causes of seizures. Focal tonic seizures are associated with the activation of a part of your brain called Brodmann area 6
.
Tonic seizures are often seen
in people who experienced hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy around birth. Hypoxic ischemic brain injuries happen because of a lack of oxygen in your brain.
It can also happen in people with intraventricular hemorrhage. Intraventricular hemorrhage is bleeding in the spaces that allow fluid to flow out of your brain.
According to the Epilepsy Foundation, tonic seizures are common among people who have Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and other types of epilepsy.
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a severe type of epilepsy that usually develops before 4 years of age
. It can be caused by:
brain malfunctions
tuberous sclerosis
lack of oxygen around birth (perinatal asphyxia)
severe head injury
brain infection
genetic conditions
In a 2019 case study
, researchers reported tonic seizures associated with autoimmune epilepsy."
tonic-clonic epilepsy or tonic-clonic seizures,tonic-clonic epilepsy or tonic-clonic seizures diagnosis,"Seizure disorders are usually diagnosed by a type of specialist called a neurologist.
Bring a written description of what happens during your seizures. Or have someone take a video and bring that along for the doctor to review. This is an important part of the diagnosis process. A neurologist can use this information to narrow down which type of seizure you�re having.
A neurologist can run various tests to help find the underlying cause of your seizures. They�ll likely give you a test called an electroencephalogram (EEG). This test uses special sensors placed on your head to detect any unusual electrical activity in your brain.
A doctor may also recommend a brain scan to look for brain tumors or structural abnormalities in your brain.
Blood tests can help a doctor rule out genetic conditions or signs of infection."
respiratory failure,respiratory failure definition,"Signs of acute respiratory failure include dizziness, shortness of breath, and a bluish discoloration of your extremities. It can be life threatening and requires immediate medical care."
respiratory failure,respiratory failure symptoms,"The symptoms of acute respiratory failure depend on its underlying cause. Symptoms can also differ by the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood.
People with low oxygen may experience
:
shortness of breath
a bluish coloration on lips, fingertips, or toes
drowsiness
difficulty performing routine activities, such as dressing or climbing stairs, due to extreme tiredness
People with high carbon dioxide levels may experience:
rapid breathing
confusion
blurred vision
headaches"
respiratory failure,respiratory failure causes,"Acute respiratory failure has several causes:
Obstruction
When something lodges in your throat, you may have trouble getting enough oxygen into your lungs. Obstruction can also occur in people with COPD or asthma when an exacerbation causes the airways to narrow.
Injury
An injury that impairs or compromises your respiratory system can negatively affect the amount of oxygen or carbon dioxide in your blood.
For instance, a spinal cord or brain injury can immediately affect your breathing. If the brain cannot relay messages to the lungs, the lungs may not function properly.
Rib or chest injuries can also affect your breathing.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a serious condition that causes fluid to build up in your lungs. It results in low oxygen in the blood. People who develop ARDS typically have an underlying health condition, such as:
pneumonia
pancreatitis
sepsis
trauma to the head or chest
blood transfusions
near drowning
lung injuries related to inhaling smoke or chemical products
Drug or alcohol use
Experiencing a drug overdose or drinking too much alcohol can also impair brain function and hinder breathing.
Chemical inhalation
Inhaling toxic chemicals, smoke, or fumes can cause acute respiratory failure. These chemicals may injure or damage lung tissue, including the air sacs and capillaries.
Stroke
A stroke happens when something disrupts blood flow to the brain. Strokes often affect only one side of the brain.
Although strokes present with some warning signs, such as slurred speech or confusion, they typically occur suddenly. If you have a stroke, you can lose the ability to breathe.
Infection
Infections can cause respiratory distress. Pneumonia, in particular, may cause respiratory failure, even without ARDS."
respiratory failure,respiratory failure risks,"You may be at risk for acute respiratory failure if you:
smoke tobacco products
drink alcohol excessively
have a family history of respiratory disease or conditions
have an injury to the spine, brain, or chest
have a compromised immune system
have chronic respiratory conditions, such as lung cancer, COPD, or asthma"
respiratory failure,respiratory failure diagnosis,"Acute respiratory failure requires immediate medical attention. You may require supplemental oxygen to help you breathe and prevent organ damage.
When you�re in stable condition, a doctor may diagnose you by:
performing a physical exam
asking questions about your personal or family health history
checking your body�s oxygen and carbon dioxide levels with a pulse oximetry device and an arterial blood gas test
ordering a chest X-ray of your lungs"
respiratory failure,respiratory failure complications,"Because acute respiratory failure means your organs are not receiving the oxygen-rich blood they need to function, complications can involve multiple organ systems. Acute respiratory failure can often
be fatal.
Pulmonary complications, or those affecting the lungs, can include:
pulmonary embolism
pulmonary fibrosis
pneumonia
pneumothorax (collapsed lung)
Other complications can include:
gastrointestinal hemorrhage
renal (kidney) failure
hepatic (liver) failure"
melanoma,melanoma definition,"What is metastatic melanoma?
Melanoma is the rarest and most dangerous type of skin cancer. It begins in the melanocytes, which are the cells in your skin that produce melanin. Melanin is the pigment responsible for skin color.
Melanoma develops into growths on your skin, which often resemble moles. These growths or tumors may also come from existing moles. Melanomas can form on skin anywhere on your body, including inside the mouth or vagina.
Metastatic melanoma occurs when the cancer spreads from the tumor to other parts of your body. This is also known as stage 4 melanoma. Melanoma is the most likely of all skin cancers to become metastatic if not caught early.
The rates of melanoma have been increasing for the past 30 years. It�s estimated that 10,130 people
will die from melanoma in 2016."
melanoma,melanoma symptoms,"Unusual moles may be the only indication of melanoma that hasn�t yet metastasized.
Moles caused by melanoma may have the following characteristics:
Asymmetry: Both sides of a healthy mole look very similar if you draw a line through it. Two halves of a mole or growth caused by melanoma look very different from each other.
Border: A healthy mole has smooth, even borders. Melanomas have jagged or uneven borders.
Color: A cancerous mole will have more than one color including:
brown
tan
black
red
white
blue
Size: Melanomas are more likely to be larger in diameter than benign moles. They usually grow to be larger than the eraser on a pencil
You should always have a doctor examine a mole that changes in size, shape, or color because it can be a sign of cancer.
Symptoms of metastatic melanoma depend on where the cancer has spread. These symptoms usually only appear once the cancer is already advanced.
If you have metastatic melanoma, you may experience symptoms such as:
hardened lumps under your skin
swollen or painful lymph nodes
difficulty breathing or a cough that doesn�t go away, if the cancer has spread to your lungs
enlarged liver or loss of appetite, if the cancer has spread to your liver or stomach
bone pain or broken bones, if the cancer has spread to the bone
weight loss
fatigue
headaches
seizures, if the cancer has spread to your brain
weakness or numbness in your arms or legs"
melanoma,melanoma causes,"Melanoma occurs due to a mutation in melanin-producing skin cells. Doctors currently believe that too much exposure to ultraviolet light either from sun exposure or tanning beds is the leading cause.
Metastatic melanoma occurs when the melanoma is not detected and treated early.
Risk factors
Several risk factors can contribute to developing melanoma. Those with a family history of melanoma have a higher risk than those who don�t. Approximately 10 percent
of people who develop melanoma have a family history of the disease. Other risk factors include:
fair or light skin
a large number of moles, especially irregular moles
frequent exposure to ultraviolet light
Those who are older are more likely to develop melanoma than younger individuals. In spite of this, melanoma is one of the most common cancers in people under 30, especially in young women. After the age of 50, men have a higher risk of developing melanoma.
The risk of melanomas becoming metastatic is higher in those who have:
primary melanomas, which are visible skin growths
melanomas that aren�t removed
a suppressed immune system"
melanoma,melanoma diagnosis,"If you notice an unusual mole or growth, make an appointment to get it checked by a dermatologist. A dermatologist is a doctor who specializes in skin conditions.
Diagnosing melanoma
If your mole looks suspicious, your dermatologist will remove a small sample to check for skin cancer. If it comes back positive, they�ll likely remove the mole completely. This is called an excisional biopsy.
They�ll also evaluate the tumor based on its thickness. Generally, the thicker the tumor, the more serious the melanoma. This will affect their treatment plan.
Diagnosing metastatic melanoma
If melanoma is detected, your doctor will run tests to make sure the cancer hasn�t spread.
One of the first tests they may order is a sentinel node biopsy. This involves injecting dye into the area the melanoma was removed from. The dye moves to the nearby lymph nodes. These lymph nodes are then removed and screened for cancer cells. If they�re cancer free, it typically means the cancer hasn�t spread.
If the cancer is in your lymph nodes, your doctor will use other tests to see if the cancer has spread anywhere else in your body. These include:
X-rays
CT scans
MRI scans
PET scans
Blood tests"
malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung,malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung definition,"Lung cancer symptoms and treatment depend on the stage of cancer and how far it has spread. Early stage symptoms of lung cancer may include cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Lung cancer is a cancer that starts in the lungs, and can spread to other areas of the body.
Early symptoms of lung cancer can be subtle, but the sooner you are diagnosed, the better your treatment options and possible outcomes.
Lung cancer is primarily treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Newer treatments include immunotherapy and targeted therapy.
Read on to learn more about lung cancer, and the current and evolving treatment options."
malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung,malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung symptoms,"Early symptoms of lung cancer
The early stages of lung cancer don�t always cause symptoms. When early symptoms do occur, they can include signs such as shortness of breath, along with unexpected symptoms, such as back pain.
Back pain can occur when tumors cause pressure in your lungs or when they spread to your spinal cord and ribs.
Other early signs of lung cancer may include:
a lingering or worsening cough
coughing up phlegm or blood
chest pain that worsens when you breathe deeply, laugh, or cough
hoarseness
wheezing
weakness and fatigue
loss of appetite and weight loss
recurrent respiratory infections such as pneumonia or bronchitis
Late symptoms of lung cancer
Additional symptoms of lung cancer depend on where new tumors form. Not everyone with late-stage lung cancer will experience every symptom.
Late-stage symptoms might include:
lumps in the neck or collarbone
bone pain especially in the back, ribs, or hips
headaches
dizziness
balance issues
numbness in arms or legs
yellowing of skin and eyes (jaundice)
drooping of one eyelid and shrunken pupils
lack of perspiration on one side of the face
shoulder pain
swelling of the face and upper body
Additionally, lung cancer tumors can sometimes release a substance similar to hormones, leading to a wide variety of symptoms known as paraneoplastic syndrome. Symptoms include: :
muscle weakness
nausea and vomiting
high blood pressure
high blood sugar
confusion
seizures"
malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung,malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung causes,"Anyone can get lung cancer, but 90 percent of lung cancer cases are the result of smoking.
Smoke damages your lung tissue from the first second you inhale it. Once lung cells are damaged, they begin to behave abnormally. This increases your risk for lung cancer.
Small-cell lung cancer is almost always associated with heavy smoking. When you stop smoking, your lungs may be able to heal, reducing your risk of lung cancer.
You can also increase your risk of lung cancer by breathing in hazardous substances such as:
radon
asbestos
arsenic
cadmium
chromium
nickel
some petroleum products
uranium
Exposure to radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer, according to the American Lung Association.
Research shows that inherited genetic mutations may make you more likely to develop lung cancer, especially if you smoke or are exposed to other carcinogens. Sometimes, there�s no obvious cause for lung cancer.

malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung,malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung risks,"There are multiple known risk factors for lung cancer. These include:
Smoking: Smoking is the single biggest risk factor for lung cancer. This includes cigarettes, cigars, and pipes. Tobacco products contain thousands of toxic substances. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
, cigarette smokers are 15 to 30 times more likely to get lung cancer than nonsmokers.
Secondhand smoke: Every year in the United States, about 7,300 people
who�ve never smoked die from lung cancer caused by secondhand smoke.
Exposure to radon: Breathing in radon is the leading cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers. It�s a good idea to test your home for levels of radon to reduce your risk.
Exposure to asbestos, diesel exhaust, and other toxic substances: Breathing in toxic substances can increase your risk, especially if you�re subject to repeat exposure.
A family history of lung cancer: Having family members with lung cancer increases your risk of lung cancer.
A personal history of lung cancer: You�re more likely to get lung cancer if you�ve had lung cancer in the past, especially if you�re a smoker.
Previous radiation therapy to the chest: Radiation therapy can increase your risk of lung cancer.

malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung,malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung diagnosis,"Diagnosing lung cancer starts with a conversation with your doctor and a physical exam. They�ll want to go over your health history and any symptoms you�re having. You�ll also need tests to confirm the diagnosis. These might include:
Imaging tests: An abnormal mass can be seen on X-ray, MRI, CT, and PET scans. These scans produce more detail and find smaller lesions.
Sputum cytology: If you produce phlegm when you cough, microscopic examination can determine if cancer cells are present.
Bronchoscopy: While under sedation, a lighted tube is passed down your throat and into your lungs, allowing closer examination of your lung tissue.
You might also have a biopsy. A biopsy is a procedure that involves obtaining a small sample of lung tissue which is then examined under a microscope. A biopsy can determine if tumor cells are cancerous. A biopsy may be performed using one of the the following methods:
Mediastinoscopy: In a mediastinoscopy, your doctor makes an incision at the base of the neck. A lighted instrument is inserted and surgical tools are used to take samples from lymph nodes. It�s usually performed in a hospital under general anesthesia.
Lung needle biopsy: With this procedure, your doctor inserts a needle through the chest wall and into the suspicious lung tissue. A needle biopsy can also be used to test lymph nodes. It�s usually performed in a hospital and you�ll be given a sedative to help you relax.
If the biopsy results are positive for cancer, you might need additional testing, such as a bone scan, to help determine if cancer has spread and to help with staging.

malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung,malignant neoplasm of lung or carcinoma of lung treatment,"The primary treatments for lung cancer include surgery to remove the tumor, and chemotherapy and radiation treatments to kill cancer cells. Sometimes, newer cancer treatments such as targeted therapy and immunotherapy are also used, but usually not until later stages.
As a rule, treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) varies from person to person. Your treatment plan will depend on specific details of your health and on the stage of your cancer when you were diagnosed.
Treatment options for NSCLC by stage typically include:
Stage 1 NSCLC: Surgery to remove a portion of the lung may be all you need. Chemotherapy may also be recommended, especially if you�re at high risk of recurrence. Cancer is most treatable if caught at this stage.
Stage 2 NSCLC: You may need surgery to remove part or all of your lung. Chemotherapy is usually recommended.
Stage 3 NSCLC: You may require a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation treatment.
Stage 4 NSCLC: Options include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.
Options for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) also include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. In most cases, the cancer will be too advanced for surgery.
If you�re diagnosed with lung cancer, your care will likely be managed by a team of doctors who may include:
a surgeon who specializes in the chest and lungs (thoracic surgeon)
a lung specialist (pulmonologist)
a medical oncologist
a radiation oncologist
Discuss all your treatment options before making a decision. Your doctors will coordinate care and keep each other informed. You may also want to discuss clinical trials with your doctor.
Clinical trials can provide access to promising new treatments and can be an option if your treatment plan has stalled.
Some people with advanced lung cancer choose not to continue treatment. You can still choose palliative care treatments, which are focused on treating the symptoms of cancer rather than the cancer itself.

manic disorder,manic disorder definition,"Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition marked by large shifts in mood from mania to depression. Although bipolar disorder can be challenging to manage, many effective treatments and strategies are available.
Bipolar disorder isn�t a rare condition. In fact, the National Institute of Mental Health says that 2.8%
of U.S. adults � or about 5 million people � have a bipolar disorder diagnosis.
The condition used to be known as manic depression and bipolar disease.
Key symptoms of bipolar disorder include:
These episodes may last from a few days to several weeks or longer.
If you�re living with bipolar disorder, the following treatment options can help you learn to manage mood episodes, which can improve not only your symptoms but also your overall quality of life."
manic disorder,manic disorder symptoms,"To receive a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, you must experience at least one period of mania or hypomania.
These both involve feelings of excitement, impulsivity, and high energy, but hypomania is considered less severe than mania. Mania symptoms can affect your day-to-day life at work or home. Hypomania symptoms typically don�t cause as much disruption, but they can still be distressing.
Some people living with bipolar disorder also experience major depressive episodes or �down� moods.
These three main symptoms � mania, hypomania, and depression � are the main features of bipolar disorder. Different types of bipolar disorder involve different combinations of these symptoms.
Bipolar I symptoms
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5)
, a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder requires the following:
at least one episode of mania that lasts at least 1 week
symptoms that affect daily function
symptoms that don�t relate to another medical or mental health condition or substance use
You could also experience symptoms of psychosis or both mania and depression (known as mixed features). These symptoms can have more impact on your life. If you have them, it�s worth reaching out for professional support as soon as possible.
While you don�t need to experience episodes of hypomania or depression to receive a bipolar I diagnosis, many people with bipolar I do report these symptoms.
Bipolar II symptoms
A diagnosis of bipolar II requires:
at least one episode of hypomania that lasts 4 days or longer
and involves 3 or more symptoms of hypomania
hypomania-related changes in mood and usual function that others can notice, though these may not necessarily affect your daily life
at least one episode of major depression that lasts 2 weeks or longer
at least one episode of major depression involving five or more key depression symptoms that have a significant impact on your day-to-day life
symptoms that don�t relate to another medical or mental health condition or substance use
Bipolar II can also involve symptoms of psychosis, but only during an episode of depression. You could also experience mixed mood episodes, which means you�ll have symptoms of depression and hypomania simultaneously.
With bipolar II, though, you won�t experience mania. If you have a manic episode, you�ll receive a diagnosis of bipolar I.
Cyclothymia symptoms
A diagnosis of cyclothymia requires:
periods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depression symptoms, off and on, over 2 years or longer
(1 year
for children and adolescents)
symptoms that never meet the full criteria for an episode of hypomania or depression
symptoms that are present for at least half of the 2 years and never absent for longer than 2 months at a time
symptoms that don�t relate to another medical or mental health condition or substance use
symptoms that cause significant distress and affect daily life
Fluctuating mood symptoms characterize cyclothymia. These symptoms may be less severe than those of bipolar I or II. Still, they tend to last longer, so you�ll generally have less time when you experience no symptoms.
Hypomania may not have a big impact on your daily life. Depression, on the other hand, often leads to more serious distress and affects day-to-day function, even if your symptoms don�t qualify for a major depressive episode.
If you do experience enough symptoms to meet the criteria for a hypomanic or depressive episode, your diagnosis will likely change to another type of bipolar disorder or major depression, depending on your symptoms."
manic disorder,manic disorder symptoms,"Most research suggests that males and females receive bipolar disorder diagnoses roughly equally
, though some studies suggest it may be more prevalent in females. However, the main symptoms of the disorder may vary, depending on the sex you were assigned at birth and your gender.
Females with bipolar disorder tend to receive diagnoses later in life, often in their 20s or 30s. Sometimes, they might first notice symptoms during pregnancy or after childbirth. They�re also more likely to be diagnosed with bipolar II than bipolar I.
Additionally, females living with bipolar disorder tend to experience:
milder episodes of mania
more depressive episodes than manic episodes
rapid cycling, or four or more episodes
of mania and depression in 1 year
more co-occurring conditions
Females with bipolar disorder may also experience relapse more often, partly due to hormone changes related to menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause. In terms of bipolar disorder, relapse means having a mood episode after not having one for some time.
Get the facts about bipolar disorder in females.
Males with bipolar disorder, on the other hand, may:
get a diagnosis earlier in life
experience less frequent but more severe episodes, especially manic episodes
be more likely to also have a substance use disorder
show more aggression during episodes of mania"
manic disorder,manic disorder treatment,"Several treatments can help you manage bipolar disorder symptoms. These include
medications, counseling, and lifestyle measures. Some natural remedies can also have benefits.
Medications
Recommended medications may include:
mood stabilizers, such as lithium (Lithobid)

Natural remedies for bipolar disorder
Some natural remedies might also help with bipolar disorder symptoms.
You�ll always want to check with your doctor or psychiatrist before trying these remedies, though. In some cases, they could interfere with any medications you�re taking.
The following herbs and supplements may help stabilize your mood and reduce symptoms of bipolar disorder when combined with medication and therapy:
Omega-3: Some 2016 research
suggests that taking an omega-3 supplement may help with symptoms of bipolar I. However, a 2021 study found weak support for using the supplement to treat depression symptoms in bipolar disorder.
Rhodiola rosea: A 2013 review
suggests this plant may help with moderate depression, so it could help treat depression associated with bipolar disorder, but this, too, has not been substantiated with newer research.
S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe): SAMe is an amino acid supplement that may help ease
symptoms of major depression and other mood disorders. However, it can induce mania and may interact with other medications.
You should consult with a doctor before trying SAMe or any other herbal or natural remedies to help you manage your bipolar symptoms.

Lifestyle changes
Some studies suggest that lifestyle measures can help reduce the severity
of your bipolar disorder symptoms. These can include the following:
eating a balanced diet
getting at least 150 minutes of exercise a week
managing your weight
getting weekly counseling or therapy
That said, the improvements reported by many of these studies were not significant
, indicating that lifestyle interventions alone may not be enough to manage the condition. They may work better when combined with other treatments."

But you can�t always prevent mood episodes entirely or keep the condition from developing in the first place.
Future research may reveal more about the specific causes of bipolar disorder and give researchers more insight into potential ways of preventing the condition."
personality disorder,personality disorder definition,"Histrionic personality disorder (HPD) is part of a larger group of psychological disorders called �Cluster B� personality disorders. Disorders in this category cause a person to be overly dramatic, emotional, or erratic.
People with HPD have a distorted mental image of themselves. They often base their self-esteem on the approval of others. This creates a need to be noticed. Because of this, people with HPD may resort to dramatic antics.
Women are diagnosed with HPD more often than men. That may be because men report their symptoms less often than women."
personality disorder,personality disorder causes,"The exact cause of histrionic personality disorder is unknown. Scientists believe it is an outcome of both environmental and genetic factors.
Some families have a history of HPD, which lends credit to the theory that the condition may be explained in part by genetics. On the other hand, children of parents with HPD may simply exhibit behavior they learned from their parents. It is also possible that a lack of discipline or positive reinforcement of dramatic behaviors in childhood can cause HPD. A child may learn HPD behaviors as a way to get attention from their parents.
No matter the cause, HPD usually presents itself by early adulthood."
personality disorder,personality disorder diagnosis,"There is no specific test that is used to diagnose HPD. If you are troubled by your symptoms and seek medical care, your primary care provider will likely begin by taking a complete medical history. They may perform a physical exam to rule out any physical problems that might be causing your symptoms.
If your primary care provider doesn�t find a physical cause for your symptoms, they may refer you to a psychiatrist. Psychiatrists are specifically trained to recognize and treat psychological disorders. A psychiatrist will be able to use expert questions to get a clear view of the history of your behavior. An accurate assessment of your behaviors will help your primary care provider diagnose you.
However, most people with this condition do not believe they need therapy or help, making diagnosis difficult. Many people who have HPD receive a diagnosis after they go into therapy for depression or anxiety, usually following a failed relationship or other personal conflicts."
personality disorder,personality disorder treatment,"Treatment can be difficult if you have HPD. Like many people with HPD, you might think you don�t need treatment, or you might find the routine of a treatment program to be unappealing. However, therapy � and sometimes medications � can help you cope with HPD.
Therapy
Psychotherapy is the most common and effective treatment choice for HPD. This kind of therapy involves talking to a therapist about your feelings and experiences. Such talks can help you and your therapist determine the reasoning behind your actions and behaviors. Your therapist may be able to help you learn how to relate with people in a positive manner, instead of continually trying to get attention from them.
Medication
If you experience depression or anxiety as a part of your HPD, your primary care provider might put you on antidepressants or antianxiety medication."
emphysema pulmonary,emphysema pulmonary definition,"Emphysema is a disease of the lungs. It occurs most often in people who smoke, but it also occurs in people who regularly breathe in irritants.
Emphysema destroys alveoli, which are air sacs in the lungs. The air sacs weaken and eventually break, which reduces the surface area of the lungs and the amount of oxygen that can reach the bloodstream. This makes it harder to breathe, especially when exercising. Emphysema also causes the lungs to lose their elasticity.
Emphysema is one of the two most common conditions that fall under the umbrella term chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The other major COPD condition is chronic bronchitis. Emphysema is an irreversible condition, so treatment aims to slow its progression and minimize symptoms."
emphysema pulmonary,emphysema pulmonary symptoms,"Some people have emphysema for years without knowing it. Some of its first signs are shortness of breath and coughing, especially during exercise or physical exertion. This continues to get worse until breathing is difficult all the time, even when resting.
Other symptoms may include:
exhaustion
weight loss
depression
Some people may develop bluish-gray lips or fingernails from lack of oxygen. If this happens, seek medical attention immediately."
emphysema pulmonary,emphysema pulmonary causes,"According to the American Lung Association, 2 million adults (1.6 percent of people ages 18 years or older) had emphysema in 2018.
Rates were higher among males, non-Hispanic white people, and those over the age of 65. However, the rates among females have been increasing in recent decades, so the gap between the sexes has been decreasing.
Smoking tobacco is the main cause of emphysema. The more you smoke, the higher your risk of developing emphysema. This includes smoking cannabis.
Smoking leads to the death of more than 480,000 Americans a year, and 80 percent of those deaths are caused by COPD, including emphysema. Exposure to secondhand smoke also increases your risk of developing emphysema.
Other causes of, as well as potential risk factors for developing emphysema, may include:
exposure to high pollution chemical fumes or lung irritants
a genetic condition called alpha-1 deficiency can lead to a rare form of emphysema called alpha-1 deficiency-related emphysema.
history of childhood respiratory infections
a compromised immune system, especially as a result of HIV
rare disorders such as Marfan syndrome."
emphysema pulmonary,emphysema pulmonary diagnosis,"Your doctor will begin by getting your background and medical history, asking in particular whether you smoke and whether you�re around hazardous fumes or pollutants at work or at home.
Various tests can detect emphysema, including:
imaging tests, such as X-rays and CT scans, to look at your lungs
blood tests, to determine how well your lungs are transferring oxygen
pulse oximetry, to measure the oxygen content of your blood
lung function tests, which measure how much air your lungs can breathe in and out and how well your lungs deliver oxygen into your bloodstream
arterial blood gas tests, to measure the amount of blood and carbon dioxide in your blood
electrocardiogram (ECG), to check heart function and rule out heart disease"
emphysema pulmonary,emphysema pulmonary complications,"When emphysema becomes severe or isn�t properly treated, serious complications may occur. These may include:
pneumonia, which can bacterial or viral
many respiratory tract infections
cor pulmonale, which is failure of the right side of the heart
pneumothorax, which is when air collects between the lungs and the chest cavity that can lead to lung collapse
respiratory acidosis, which is when the lungs can�t obtain enough oxygen, leading to coma
hypoxemia, which is when the lungs can�t adequately oxygenate the blood"
emphysema pulmonary,emphysema pulmonary prevention,"Since emphysema is mainly caused by smoking tobacco, the best way to prevent it is to refrain from smoking. It�s also important to stay away from harmful chemicals and fumes as well as heavy pollution.
The outlook for people with emphysema varies based on its severity. There�s no cure for the disease, and it worsens with time, but you can slow its progression.
As a rule, smoking cigarettes speeds up the disease, so quitting is important.
Early detection of the disease is key, because people with emphysema can develop life threatening conditions when the lungs and heart become damaged over time.
It�s important to stay healthy by eating well and getting exercise. With the aid of medications and therapies, you can live a long, healthy life with emphysema."
hemorrhoids,hemorrhoids definition,"You may develop external hemorrhoids from straining during a bowel movement or pregnancy. Treatment can include topical products and using a cold compress. Severe hemorrhoids may need medical intervention.
You�ve probably heard of hemorrhoids, also called piles. They are inflamed veins that cause lumps around your anus, and they can be quite painful.
Hemorrhoids can be internal or external, and it�s possible to have both types at the same time.
Both types often go away on their own, but sometimes require medical intervention.
Hemorrhoids are common, affecting about 1 in 20 people in the United States overall and about half of people over age 50, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)
.
They also tend to happen more often in certain people, including pregnant people and those who frequently strain while pooping."
hemorrhoids,hemorrhoids causes,"External hemorrhoids are when one or more tender bumps form beneath the skin surrounding your anus. These are dilated blood vessels that have become so enlarged that they protrude.
Blood may clot, or thrombose, inside the protruding blood vessel. This can form a hard lump and cause considerable pain in some cases.
External and internal hemorrhoids are caused by many of the same factors. These include:
Straining while pooping. The most common cause of external hemorrhoids is repeated straining while having a bowel movement. This is often caused by severe cases of constipation or diarrhea. Straining makes blood pool in the area.
Sitting on the toilet for a long time. This can also put pressure on the tissues around your rectum and anus.
Weakened support tissues. As you age, the tissues tend to weaken around the anus and rectum.
Pregnancy. Pregnant people may also be at an increased risk of hemorrhoids because of the increased pressure of the abdomen on these veins.
Obesity. Having excess weight has been associated with having hemorrhoids.
Heavy lifting. You may have a higher risk of hemorrhoids if you frequently lift heavy objects.
Not eating enough fiber. A low fiber diet may lead to constipation, which can cause hemorrhoids."
hemorrhoids,hemorrhoids symptoms,"A range of symptoms can affect a person with external hemorrhoids. Symptoms vary depending on the severity. Some of the symptoms that you may have include:
one or more tender, blue-colored lumps on the skin near the opening of the anus
itching around the anus or rectal area
aching or pain around your anus, particularly within 24 to 48 hours of onset and when you�re sitting down
You may notice bleeding when you�re using the toilet. This includes seeing blood on toilet paper or in the toilet. Lumps around the anus may feel as if they are swollen. Larger external hemorrhoids may make it difficult to keep the anal area clean.
These symptoms may also occur because of other conditions. If you experience them, you should schedule an exam with your doctor.
Symptoms of external hemorrhoids may go away after a few days, according to the NIDDK
. The body usually gradually reabsorbs the hemorrhoid over time."
hemorrhoids,hemorrhoids risks,"If your parents have had hemorrhoids, you may be more likely to have them as well. Hemorrhoids may also be more likely to happen during pregnancy.
As we age, hemorrhoids can occur due to increased pressure caused by sitting a lot. And anything that causes you to strain during bowel movements can lead to external hemorrhoids.
A healthcare professional may be able to help you determine the cause of your hemorrhoids."
hemorrhoids,hemorrhoids diagnosis,"To diagnose external hemorrhoids, a doctor will ask about your health history and symptoms. They will also likely do a physical exam.
In the case of external hemorrhoids, they will generally be able to see the hemorrhoids by examining the area around your anus.
They may also perform a digital rectum exam and anoscopy to check for issues inside your anal canal and rectum, including internal hemorrhoids.
During a digital rectal exam, your doctor will insert their gloved, lubricated finger into your anus. They�ll be able to feel abnormalities inside.
During an anoscopy, the doctor will insert a device called an anoscope into your rectum that allows them to see abnormalities.
If you also have rectal bleeding, your doctor will likely request that you get a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy to rule out colorectal cancer. These methods will also detect any internal hemorrhoids."
hemorrhoids,hemorrhoids prevention,"Here are some steps you can take to prevent hemorrhoids:
Avoid straining to poop. This includes avoiding sitting on the toilet for long periods of time.
Take measures to prevent constipation. This includes eating high fiber foods, drinking lots of water, and taking fiber supplements, stool softener, or laxatives. Here are more solutions you can try at home for preventing constipation.
Avoid heavy lifting. Try not to strain yourself.
Ask for professional advice if you�re at higher risk. Speak with a healthcare professional if you�re at higher risk of constipation or hemorrhoids, such as if you�re pregnant, have a compromised immune system, or are taking medications to reduce blood clotting."
aphasia,aphasia definition,"Aphasia is a communication disorder that can interfere with your verbal communication, written communication, or both. It�s caused by damage to one or more areas of the brain that control language, and there are many types.
There are a few different types of aphasia. The type depends on the part of the brain that has been impacted. Aphasia can cause problems with your ability to:
According to the National Aphasia Association, aphasia affects about 2 million people in the United States, but many people have never heard of it.
Just because someone is living with aphasia does not mean they have a mental disorder or have lowered intelligence."
aphasia,aphasia symptoms,"Symptoms of aphasia can vary from mild to severe. They depend on where the damage occurs in your brain and the severity of that damage.
Many of the symptoms of the different types of aphasia can overlap, which is why it�s essential to get a medical professional�s opinion if you believe you or someone you love is living with aphasia.
Aphasia can affect your:
speaking
comprehension
reading
writing
expressive communication, which involves using words and sentences
receptive communication, which involves understanding the words of others
Symptoms that affect expressive communication can include:
speaking in short, incomplete sentences or phrases
speaking in sentences that others can�t understand
using the wrong words or nonsense words
using words in the wrong order
Symptoms that affect receptive communication can include:
difficulty understanding other people�s speech
difficulty following fast-paced speech
misunderstanding figurative speech"
aphasia,aphasia causes,"Aphasia occurs most often as a result of damage to one or more areas of your brain that control language.
Aphasia can occur due to:
a brain tumor
an infection
dementia or another neurological disorder
a degenerative disease
a head injury
a stroke
Strokes are the most common cause of aphasia. According to the National Aphasia Association, aphasia occurs in 25 to 40 percent of people who�ve had a stroke.
When to see a doctor
Because aphasia is often the result of a stroke, it�s essential to speak with a doctor if you suddenly have difficulty:
speaking
comprehending others
reading
writing
Or, if you suddenly develop:
a weak or numb feeling in your arm
walking difficulties
drooping on one side of your face
a severe headache
A stroke is not always painful. Knowing the signs
may save your life.
Causes of temporary aphasia
Seizures or migraine can cause temporary aphasia.
Temporary aphasia can also occur due to a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which temporarily interrupts blood flow to your brain. A TIA is sometimes called a �ministroke.�
The effects of a TIA include:
weakness
numbness of certain body parts
difficulty speaking
difficulty understanding speech
A TIA is different from a stroke because its effects are temporary, but it can also be a precursor to an actual stroke. Anyone who believes they�ve just dealt with a TIA should talk with a doctor immediately."
aphasia,aphasia risks,"Aphasia can affect people of all ages, including children.
Since strokes are the most common cause of aphasia, the majority of people with aphasia are middle-aged or older."
aphasia,aphasia diagnosis,"If your doctor suspects you or someone you care for has aphasia, they may order imaging tests to find the source of the problem. A CT or MRI scan can help them identify the location and severity of the brain damage.
Your doctor may also screen you for aphasia during treatment for a brain injury or stroke. For example, they may test your ability to:
follow commands
name objects
participate in a conversation
answer questions
write words
read
If you have aphasia, a speech-language pathologist can help identify specific communication disabilities. During the examination, they�ll test your ability to:
speak clearly
express ideas coherently
interact with others
read
write
understand verbal and written language
use alternative forms of communication
swallow"
aphasia,aphasia prevention,"Many of the conditions that cause aphasia aren�t preventable, such as brain tumors or degenerative diseases. However, the most common cause of aphasia is stroke. If you can work on reducing your risk of stroke, you can lower your risk of aphasia.
You can take the following steps to lower your risk of stroke:
Try to stop smoking if you smoke.
Drink alcohol in moderation.
Prioritize exercise.
Eat a diet that�s lower in sodium and fat
Take steps to manage your blood pressure and cholesterol.
Take steps to manage diabetes or circulation problems if you have them.
Get treatment for atrial fibrillation if you have it.
Get immediate medical care if you develop the symptoms of a stroke."
obesity morbid,obesity morbid definition,"What Is Morbid Obesity?
Morbid obesity is a condition in which you have a body mass index (BMI) higher than 35. BMI is used to estimate body fat and can help determine if you are at a healthy body weight for your size. BMI is not a perfect measurement but it does help give a general idea of ideal weight ranges for height."
obesity morbid,obesity morbid causes,"When you eat, your body uses the calories you consume to run your body. Even at rest, the body needs calories to pump your heart or digest food. If those calories are not used, the body stores them as fat. Your body will build up fat stores if you continue to eat more calories than your body can use during daily activities and exercise. Obesity and morbid obesity are the result of too much fat being stored in your body.
Certain medications, such as antidepressants, can cause weight gain. Medical conditions such as hypothyroidism can also lead to weight gain, but can usually be managed so that they do not lead to obesity."
obesity morbid,obesity morbid risks,"Anyone can gain weight and develop obesity if they eat more calories than their bodies can use.
Some studies
have shown that genetic factors
can play a role in how your body stores energy. More research is being done to further explore the relationship between genes and weight.
Many behavioral factors play a role in obesity as well, including your eating habits and daily activity level. Many people develop their eating habits as children and have trouble refining them to maintain proper body weight as they age. As an adult, you may be inactive at your job and have less time for exercise, meal planning, and physical activity.
Other factors, such as stress, anxiety, and lack of sleep, can lead to weight gain. People who quit smoking often experience temporary weight gain. Women may also have trouble losing the weight they gain during pregnancy, or may gain additional weight during menopause. These factors do not necessarily lead to morbid obesity but can certainly contribute to its onset."
obesity morbid,obesity morbid diagnosis,"Your doctor will perform a physical exam and ask you about the history of your weight and your weight-loss efforts. They will ask you about your eating and exercise habits, and your medical history.
Calculating BMI
BMI is calculated when your weight in kilograms is divided by your height in meters squared. You can calculate your BMI by using a calculator
provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Here are BMI ranges and their corresponding categories of obesity:
underweight: under 18.5 percent
normal: 18.5 to 24.9 percent
overweight: 25.0 to 29.9
obese (class 1): 30.0 and 34.9
morbid obesity (class 2): 35-39.9
Using BMI as a diagnosis tool for obesity has limitations. Your BMI is only an estimate of your body fat. For example, athletes may have a high weight because of their higher muscle mass. They could fall into the BMI range of obesity or morbid obesity, but actually have a small amount of body fat. Because of this, your doctor might use other tests to get an exact reading of your body fat percentage.
Calculating Body Fat Percentage
A skinfold test may also be done to check your body fat percentage. In this test, a doctor measures the thickness of a fold of skin from the arm, abdomen, or thigh with a caliper. Another way to test body fat percentage includes bioelectrical impedance, which is often done using a special type of scale. Finally, body fat can be more accurately measured using special equipment to calculate water or air displacement.
Other Tests
Your doctor may order additional blood tests to look for hormonal or other medical problems that could be causing your weight gain.

obesity morbid,obesity morbid complications,"Obesity is a health concern. Without proper treatment, obesity can lead to other serious health problems, such as:
osteoarthritis
heart disease and blood lipid abnormalities
stroke
type 2 diabetes
sleep apnea (when you periodically stop breathing during sleep)
reproductive problems
gallstones
certain cancers
obesity hypoventilation syndrome
metabolic syndrome"
obesity morbid,obesity morbid prevention,"Obesity and morbid obesity are serious and potentially life-threatening conditions. A healthy lifestyle that includes a healthy diet and regular exercise are important for preventing obesity.
Diet and Exercise
People who have morbid obesity should avoid �fad� diets and focus instead on changing eating behaviors. Recommendations include:
adding more fruits and vegetables to your diet
eating smaller meals
count calories
eating mindfully
limiting saturated fats, trans fats, and refined sugars
Physical activity is good for overall health and is especially important if you�re trying to lose weight. To begin losing weight, you will need to do moderate to vigorous exercise for more than three hours per week. Vigorous activity raises your heart rate significantly. Be sure to check with your doctor before you begin any vigorous exercise programs. Examples of beneficial physical activity include:
running or jogging
swimming
jumping rope
brisk walking
biking
Moderate exercise can also include everyday activities like shoveling snow or yard work."
pyelonephritis,pyelonephritis definition,"Understanding pyelonephritis
Acute pyelonephritis is a sudden and severe kidney infection. It causes the kidneys to swell and may permanently damage them. Pyelonephritis can be life-threatening.
When repeated or persistent attacks occur, the condition is called chronic pyelonephritis. The chronic form is rare, but it happens more often in children or people with urinary obstructions."
pyelonephritis,pyelonephritis symptoms,"Symptoms usually appear within two days of infection. Common symptoms include:
a fever greater than 102�F (38.9�C)
pain in the abdomen, back, side, or groin
painful or burning urination
cloudy urine
pus or blood in the urine
urgent or frequent urination
fishy-smelling urine
Other symptoms can include:
shaking or chills
nausea
vomiting
general aching or ill feeling
fatigue
moist skin
mental confusion
Symptoms may be different in children and older adults than they are in other people. For example, mental confusion is common in older adults and is often their only symptom.
People with chronic pyelonephritis may experience only mild symptoms or may even lack noticeable symptoms altogether."
pyelonephritis,pyelonephritis causes,"The infection usually starts in the lower urinary tract as a urinary tract infection (UTI). Bacteria enter the body through the urethra and begin to multiply and spread up to the bladder. From there, the bacteria travel through the ureters to the kidneys.
Bacteria such as E. coli often cause the infection. However, any serious infection in the bloodstream can also spread to the kidneys and cause acute pyelonephritis."
pyelonephritis,pyelonephritis risks,"Acute pyelonephritis
Any problem that interrupts the normal flow of urine causes a greater risk of acute pyelonephritis. For example, a urinary tract that�s an unusual size or shape is more likely to lead to acute pyelonephritis.
Also, women�s urethras are much shorter than men�s, so it�s easier for bacteria to enter their bodies. That makes women more prone to kidney infections and puts them at a higher risk of acute pyelonephritis.
Other people who are at increased risk include:
anyone with chronic kidney stones or other kidney or bladder conditions
older adults
people with suppressed immune systems, such as people with diabetes, HIV/AIDS, or cancer
people with vesicoureteral reflux (a condition where small amounts of urine back up from the bladder into the ureters and kidneys)
people with an enlarged prostate
Other factors that can make you vulnerable to infection include:
catheter use
cystoscopic examination
urinary tract surgery
certain medications
nerve or spinal cord damage
Chronic pyelonephritis
Chronic forms of the condition are more common in people with urinary obstructions. These can be caused by UTIs, vesicoureteral reflux, or anatomical anomalies. Chronic pyelonephritis is more common in children than in adults."
pyelonephritis,pyelonephritis diagnosis,"Urine tests
A doctor will check for fever, tenderness in the abdomen, and other common symptoms. If they suspect a kidney infection, they will order a urine test. This helps them check for bacteria, concentration, blood, and pus in the urine.
Imaging tests
The doctor may also order an ultrasound to look for cysts, tumors, or other obstructions in the urinary tract.
For people who don�t respond to treatment within 72 hours, a CT scan (with or without injectable dye) may be ordered. This test can also detect obstructions within the urinary tract.
Radioactive imaging
A dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) test may be ordered if your doctor suspects scarring as a result of pyelonephritis. This is an imaging technique that tracks an injection of radioactive material.
A healthcare professional injects the material through a vein in the arm. The material then travels to the kidneys. Images taken as the radioactive material passes through the kidneys show infected or scarred areas."
pyelonephritis,pyelonephritis complications,"A possible complication of acute pyelonephritis is chronic kidney disease. If the infection continues, the kidneys may be permanently damaged. Although rare, it�s also possible for the infection to enter the bloodstream. This can result in a potentially deadly infection called sepsis.
Other complications include:
recurring kidney infections
the infection spreading to areas around the kidneys
acute kidney failure
kidney abscess"
pyelonephritis,pyelonephritis prevention,"Pyelonephritis can be a serious condition. Contact your doctor as soon as you suspect that you have pyelonephritis or a UTI. This condition requires prompt medical attention, so the earlier you start treatment, the better.
Prevention tips
Drink plenty of fluids to increase urination and remove bacteria from the urethra.
Urinate after sex to help flush out bacteria.
Wipe from front to back.
Avoid using products that can irritate the urethra, such as douches or feminine sprays.
Was this helpful?"
endocarditis,endocarditis definition,"What is endocarditis?
Endocarditis is inflammation of your heart�s inner lining, called the endocardium. It�s usually caused by bacteria. When the inflammation is caused by infection, the condition is called infective endocarditis. Endocarditis is uncommon in people with healthy hearts."
endocarditis,endocarditis symptoms,"The symptoms of endocarditis aren�t always severe, and they may develop slowly over time. In the early stages of endocarditis, the symptoms are similar to many other illnesses. This is why many cases go undiagnosed.
Many of the symptoms are similar to cases of the flu or other infections, such as pneumonia. However, some people experience severe symptoms that appear suddenly. These symptoms may be due to inflammation or the associated damage it causes.
Common symptoms of endocarditis include:
heart murmur, which is an abnormal heart sound of turbulent blood flow through the heart
pale skin
fever or chills
night sweats
muscle or joint pain
nausea or decreased appetite
a full feeling in the upper left part of your abdomen
unintentional weight loss
swollen feet, legs, or abdomen
cough or shortness of breath
Less common symptoms of endocarditis include:
blood in your urine
weight loss
an enlarged spleen, which may be tender to touch
Changes in the skin may also occur, including:
tender red or purple spots below the skin of fingers or toes
tiny red or purple spots from blood cells that leaked out of ruptured capillary vessels, which usually appear on the whites of the eyes, inside the cheeks, on the roof of the mouth, or on the chest
The signs and symptoms of infectious endocarditis vary greatly from person to person. They can change over time, and they depend on the cause of your infection, heart health, and how long the infection has been present. If you have a history of heart problems, heart surgery, or prior endocarditis, you should contact your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms. It�s especially important to contact your doctor if you have a constant fever that will not break or you�re unusually tired and don�t know why."
endocarditis,endocarditis causes,"The main cause of endocarditis is an overgrowth of bacteria. Although these bacteria normally live on the inside or outside surfaces of your body, you might bring them inside to your bloodstream by eating or drinking. Bacteria could also enter through cuts in your skin or oral cavity. Your immune system normally fights off germs before they cause a problem, but this process fails in some people.
In the case of infective endocarditis, the germs travel through your bloodstream and into your heart, where they multiply and cause inflammation. Endocarditis can also be caused by fungi or other germs.
Eating and drinking aren�t the only ways that germs can enter your body. They can also get into your bloodstream through:
brushing your teeth
having poor oral hygiene or gum disease
having a dental procedure that cuts your gums
contracting a sexually transmitted disease
using a contaminated needle
through an indwelling urinary catheter or intravenous catheter"
endocarditis,endocarditis risks,"Risk factors for developing endocarditis include the following:
injecting illicit intravenous drugs with a needle contaminated with bacteria or fungi
scarring caused by heart valve damage, which allows bacteria or germs to grow
tissue damage from having endocarditis in the past
having a heart defect
having an artificial heart valve replacement"
endocarditis,endocarditis diagnosis,"Your doctor will go over your symptoms and medical history before conducting any tests. After this review, they�ll use a stethoscope to listen to your heart. The following tests may also be done:
Blood test
If your doctor suspects you have endocarditis, a blood culture test will be ordered to confirm whether bacteria, fungi, or other microorganisms are causing it. Other blood tests can also reveal if your symptoms are caused by another condition, such as anemia.
Transthoracic echocardiogram
A transthoracic echocardiogram is a non-radiating imaging test used to view your heart and its valves. This test uses ultrasound waves to create an image of your heart, with the imaging probe placed on the front of your chest. Your doctor can use this imaging test to look for signs of damage or abnormal movements of your heart.
Transesophageal echocardiogram
When a transthoracic echocardiogram doesn�t provide enough information to assess your heart accurately, your doctor might order an additional imaging test called a transesophageal echocardiogram. This is used to view your heart by way of your esophagus.
Electrocardiogram
An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) may be requested to get a better view of your heart�s electrical activity. This test can detect an abnormal heart rhythm or rate. A technician will attach 12 to 15 soft electrodes to your skin. These electrodes are attached to electrical leads (wires), which are then attached to the EKG machine.
Chest X-ray
A collapsed lung or other lung problems can cause some of the same symptoms as endocarditis. A chest X-ray may be used to view your lungs and see if they�ve collapsed or if fluid has built up in them. A buildup of fluid is called pulmonary edema. The X-ray can help your doctor tell the difference between endocarditis and other conditions involving with your lungs."
endocarditis,endocarditis complications,"Complications may develop from damage caused by your infection. These can include an abnormal heart rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation, blood clots, other organ injury, and hyperbilirubinemia with jaundice. Infected blood can also cause emboli, or clots, to travel to other parts of your body.
Other organs that can be affected include:
kidneys, which may become inflamed, causing a condition called glomerulonephritis
lungs
brain
bones, particularly your spinal column, which may become infected, causing osteomyelitis
Bacteria or fungi can circulate from your heart and affect these areas. These germs can also cause abscesses to develop in your organs or other parts of your body.
Additional severe complications that can arise from endocarditis include stroke and heart failure."
endocarditis,endocarditis prevention,"Having good oral hygiene and keeping regular dental appointments can help lower the risk of bacteria building up in your mouth and getting into your bloodstream. This reduces your risk of developing endocarditis from an oral infection or injury. If you�ve undergone a dental treatment that was followed up with antibiotics, make sure to take your antibiotics as directed.
If you have a history of congenital heart disease, a heart surgery, or endocarditis, be on the watch for the signs and symptoms of endocarditis. Pay special attention to a persistent fever and unexplained fatigue. Contact your doctor as soon as possible if you have any of these symptoms.
You should also avoid:
body piercings
tattoos
IV drug use
any procedure that might allow germs to enter your blood"
pneumothorax,pneumothorax definition,A collapsed lung is the medical term for when air escapes outside of the lungs into the chest. The pressure causes the lung to be unable to expand. This is also called pneumothorax.
pneumothorax,pneumothorax symptoms,"If pneumothorax results from trauma, the symptoms often appear at the time of the injury or shortly after. Symptoms of spontaneous pneumothorax might appear when a person is at rest. A sudden attack of chest pain is often the first symptom.
Symptoms may include:
a sudden, sharp, stabbing pain in the chest
rapid breathing or shortness of breath (dyspnea)
turning blue, known as cyanosis
a rapid
heart rate
low blood pressure
lung expansion on one side
a hollow sound if you tap on the chest
an enlarged jugular vein
anxiety
fatigue"
pneumothorax,pneumothorax causes,"There are different ways of categorizing pneumothorax, according to their causes or their impact.
One way of differentiating them is as follows
:
traumatic pneumothorax
nontraumatic pneumothorax
primary spontaneous
secondary spontaneous
Other subtypes with either traumatic or nontraumatic causes are:
simple, when it does not affect the position of other structures
tension, which affects the position of other structures, like the heart
open, when air moves in and out of an open wound in the chest
Traumatic pneumothorax
Traumatic pneumothorax occurs after some type of trauma or injury has happened to the chest or lung wall. It can be a minor or significant injury. The trauma can damage chest structures and cause air to leak into the pleural space.
Here are some types of injuries that can cause traumatic pneumothorax:
trauma to the chest from a motor vehicle accident
broken ribs
a blow to the chest during a contact sport, like football tackle
a stab or bullet wound to the chest
accidental damage during a medical procedure like a central line placement, ventilator use, lung biopsies, or CPR
diving, flying, or being at high altitude due to air pressure changes
Quick treatment of pneumothorax due to chest trauma is critical as it can lead to fatal complications like cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, shock, and death.
Nontraumatic pneumothorax
This type of pneumothorax is called spontaneous, as it does not result from trauma.
When primary spontaneous pneumothorax happens, there�s no clear reason why it occurs. It�s more likely
to happen:
in people who smoke
during pregnancy
in people with Marfan syndrome
in those with a family history of pneumothorax
in an otherwise healthy person with a tall, thin body
Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax can happen if a person has:
a form of COPD, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis
acute or chronic infection, like tuberculosis or pneumonia
lung cancer
cystic fibrosis
asthma
severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
collagen vascular disease
Inhaling drugs like cocaine or marijuana can also trigger it.
Tension pneumothorax
Tension pneumothorax is not a classification of pneumothorax but a term that reflects the severity of pneumothorax. You may experience
it if you have:
a blow to the chest
a penetrating injury
changes in pressure when diving, flying, or mountaineering
a spontaneous pneumothorax progressing to a tension type
some medical procedures"
pneumothorax,pneumothorax risks,"The risk factors
are different for a traumatic and spontaneous pneumothorax.
Risk factors for a traumatic pneumothorax include:
contact sports, like football or hockey
employment where there�s a risk of falls or other types of injury
having a medical procedure that involves the chest or lung area
ongoing assisted respiratory care
The people at highest risk of a nontraumatic pneumothorax include those who:
have a history of smoking
have an existing lung condition, like asthma or COPD
have a family history of pneumothorax, which may indicate genetic factors
have tall, slim bodies, as this can affect
pressure at the top of the lung
have inflammation in the small airways"
pneumothorax,pneumothorax complications,"Pneumothorax can lead to a number of complications, some of which can be life-threatening.
They include:
respiratory failure or inability to breathe
pulmonary edema following treatment for pneumothorax
pneumohemothorax, when blood enters the chest cavity
pneumopericardium, when air enters the cavity around the heart
pneumoperitoneum, when are enters the space around the abdomen
bronchopulmonary fistula, when a passageway opens between the lungs and the space around them
heart attack
Tension pneumothorax can quickly progress to:
an inability to breathe
cardiovascular collapse
death
It�s essential to seek emergency medical help as soon as symptoms arise."
pneumothorax,pneumothorax treatment,"Treatment aims to relieve pressure on the lung and allow it to re-expand.
The options will depend on:
how severe the condition is
whether the chest cavity is continuing to expand
the cause
whether it�s happened before or has been going on for some time
If you have tension pneumothorax or pneumothorax due to an injury, this is a life-threatening emergency. You�ll need immediate medical care and possibly surgery.
Here are some of the treatment strategies:
Observation
If pneumothorax results from a small injury, it may heal without treatment within a few days. Check with a doctor before flying or diving after pneumothorax.
If you�re having trouble breathing, you may need oxygen. Using oxygen can also help speed up
the rate at which the lungs reabsorb air from the cavity.
Draining excess air
If the damage is significant or symptoms are severe, a surgeon may need to remove the air or carry out surgery.
Needle aspiration and chest tube insertion are two procedures designed to remove excess air from the pleural space in the chest. These can be done at the bedside without requiring general anesthesia.
In needle aspiration, the doctor inserts a needle into the cavity and extracts the air using a syringe.
For a chest tube insertion, the doctor will insert a hollowed tube between your ribs. This allows air to drain and the lung to reinflate. The tube may remain in place for 2 to 5 days or longer.
Surgery
The doctor may need to carry out a more invasive procedure to see what�s happening in your lungs, like a thoracotomy or thoracoscopy.
During a thoracotomy, your surgeon will create an incision in the pleural space to help them see the problem. During a thoracoscopy, also known as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), the doctor inserts a tiny camera through the chest wall to examine the lung.
If you�ve had repeated episodes of pneumothorax, you may need a small operation to repair any weak areas in the lung where the air is getting through. The doctor may also carry out pleurodesis, in which they stick the lung to the inside of the chest wall.
Other surgical options include:
sewing blisters closed
closing air leaks
or removing the collapsed portion of your lung, which is called a lobectomy
These interventions can reduce the risk of pneumothorax happening again."
pneumothorax,pneumothorax diagnosis,"In many cases, a person with pneumothorax will need emergency medical treatment, and emergency doctors will carry out the evaluation and diagnosis.
A doctor will look for signs of air in the space around the lungs.
They�ll ask about:
symptoms
personal and family medical history
recent activities
any previous cases of pneumothorax
They may also carry out imaging tests, like:
an X-ray
a CT scan
a thoracic ultrasound"
delirium,delirium definition,"Delirium is a sudden change in your alertness and thinking. People with delirium typically become confused and have trouble paying attention.
Delirium is an abrupt change to your mental state. It makes it difficult to think, remember, focus, and more. Some people with delirium become drowsy and quiet, while others can become agitated.
Symptoms of delirium generally appear quickly over a period of hours or days. The symptoms tend to fluctuate, meaning they are more severe at some times, and less severe at others.
You might experience delirium due to illness, infection, or medication side effects, among other reasons.
Delirium is a serious condition, but it�s often temporary. Your doctor will treat delirium by finding and treating the underlying causes."
delirium,delirium causes,"Delirium happens when stressors like inflammation or infection interfere with your brain function. There are many possible causes.
The condition is very common among older adults who need hospital care. Around one-third of hospital patients over age 70 experience delirium at some point during their hospital stay. It�s possible for younger people to experience delirium too, although it�s less common.
Any condition or factor that significantly changes your brain function can cause severe mental confusion. These include:
certain medications, such as sedatives, blood pressure medications, sleeping pills, and pain relievers
acute illness
infections
worsening symptoms of a long-term (chronic) illness
lack of oxygen � for example, breathing difficulties from asthma
blocked arteries (ischemia) � for example, in the brain or heart
severe pain
dehydration
sleep deprivation
metabolic issues, such as low blood sugar or an electrolyte imbalance
alcohol withdrawal in people with long-term, heavy alcohol use
surgery or general anesthesia
Medication side effects are a major cause of delirium. Up to 39%
of the time, delirium is caused by medications."
delirium,delirium risks,"In general, older adults with multiple health conditions are more likely to experience delirium. But it can happen in younger people, too.
Factors that may increase your risk for delirium include:
dementia, or symptoms of dementia without a formal diagnosis
age older than 70
male sex
a disability that makes it difficult to carry out basic tasks of living
living with multiple health conditions
impaired hearing or vision
mild cognitive impairment
symptoms of depression
alcohol use disorder
abnormal results on laboratory tests, such as blood or urine tests"
delirium,delirium symptoms,"Delirium affects your mind, emotions, movements, and sleep patterns.
You might have a hard time concentrating or feel confused about what�s happening around you. You may also move more slowly or quickly than usual, and experience mood swings.
Other symptoms may include:
not thinking clearly
having trouble speaking clearly or participating in a conversation
being easily distracted
losing track of what time it is and where you are (disorientation)
sleeping poorly or feeling drowsy
sudden changes in your ability to carry out everyday activities, like eating or walking
difficulty remembering recent events
becoming agitated or paranoid
If alcohol withdrawal progresses to delirium, symptoms may include
:
confusion
hallucinations
rapid heart rate
high blood pressure
excessive sweating
dangerously high body temperature
agitation"
delirium,delirium diagnosis,"A healthcare professional can diagnose you with delirium. Usually, this is done by a doctor or, in some cases, a nurse.
The clinician will observe your symptoms and examine you to see how you think, speak, and move.
Confusion assessment method
Many health professionals use the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) to diagnose or rule out delirium. This is a screening test that helps them observe whether or not:
your behavior and mental state is fluctuating over time
you have a hard time paying attention or following others as they speak
you have trouble keeping your thoughts organized
you�re experiencing an altered state of alertness
Tests and exams
Many factors can cause changes in brain chemistry and function. Your doctor will try to determine the cause of the delirium by running tests relevant to your symptoms and medical history.
One or more of the following tests may be needed
to check for underlying causes:
blood tests
chest X-ray
urine tests
electrocardiogram (EKG)
bladder imaging
Your doctor may also request other tests, depending on your symptoms."
neutropenia,neutropenia definition,"Neutropenia is a blood condition characterized by low levels of neutrophils, which are white blood cells that protect your body from infections. This means your body can�t fight off bacteria.
Having neutropenia increases your risk for many types of infection. Read on to learn about the types, causes, and treatments for the condition."
neutropenia,neutropenia symptoms,"Neutropenia symptoms can range from mild to severe. The lower the level of neutrophils, the more intense the symptoms.
Typical symptoms include:
fever
pneumonia
sinus infections
otitis media (ear infection)
gingivitis (gum inflammation)
omphalitis (navel infection)
skin abscesses
Severe congenital neutropenia can have serious symptoms. The symptoms often include bacterial infections. These infections can grow on the skin and in the digestive and respiratory systems.
The symptoms of cyclic neutropenia recur in 3-week cycles. Infections can increase when neutrophil levels fall.
The symptoms of autoimmune and idiopathic neutropenia include infections. They�re usually not as severe as those in congenital forms."
neutropenia,neutropenia causes,"Neutropenia can be triggered by:
chemotherapy
radiation therapy
the use of certain drugs
Other causes include:
Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, which is an inherited condition affecting many organs and often characterized by bone marrow and pancreatic failure
glycogen-storage disease type 1b, which is a rare inherited disorder that affects blood sugar levels
leukemia
viral illnesses
severe aplastic anemia
Fanconi anemia
conditions that affect bone marrow
infections, both viral and bacterial, including HIV, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and Lyme disease
deficiencies in certain vitamins and minerals, including B12, folic acid, and copper
According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, most people with severe congenital neutropenia have no family history of the condition."
neutropenia,neutropenia risks,"The risk of neutropenia is increased by certain conditions, such as:
cancer
leukemia
a weakened immune system
Chemotherapy and radiation therapy also raise the risk.
Idiopathic neutropenia affects people of all ages, but people over 70 are at higher risk. Men and women are at equal risk."
neutropenia,neutropenia diagnosis,"Your doctor can use these tests to diagnose neutropenia:
Complete blood count (CBC). This test measures neutrophil counts. Intermittent CBC tests can help your doctor check for changes in neutrophil count three times per week for 6 weeks.
Antibody blood test. This test checks for autoimmune neutropenia.
Bone marrow aspirate. This procedure tests bone marrow cells.
Bone marrow biopsy. This involves testing a piece of the bony part of bone marrow.
Cytogenetic and molecular testing. This testing helps your healthcare provider study the structures of the cells."
neutropenia,neutropenia prevention,"No specific prevention for neutropenia is known. However, the National Neutropenia Network advises the following to reduce complications:
Maintain good oral hygiene. Get regular dental exams, and use an antibacterial mouthwash.
Keep vaccinations current.
Get medical care for a fever above 101.3�F (38.5�C).
Wash your hands thoroughly.
Care for cuts and scrapes.
Use antibiotics and antifungals as directed.
Know how to reach your doctor and hospital.
Talk with your doctor before traveling out of the country.
These preventive lifestyle measures can help you to reduce potential complications of neutropenia. Talk with your doctor about any symptoms that arise, and always know how to reach your doctor and hospital."
hyperbilirubinemia,hyperbilirubinemia definition,"Many newborns naturally � and temporarily � have elevated blood levels of bilirubin. In adults, high bilirubin may indicate health conditions such as gallstones or liver issues. It may occur with jaundice.
Bilirubin is a yellowish substance in your blood. It forms after red blood cells break down and travel through your liver, gallbladder, and digestive tract before excretion.
The condition of having high bilirubin levels is called hyperbilirubinemia. It�s usually a sign of an underlying condition, so following up with a doctor is essential if test results show you have high bilirubin.
It�s also a common temporary condition in newborns.
Read on to learn more about the symptoms of high bilirubin and what can cause it."
hyperbilirubinemia,hyperbilirubinemia causes,"Having high bilirubin can be a sign of several conditions. Your doctor will take your symptoms, as well as any other test results, into account to help narrow down a diagnosis.
Gallstones: These develop when substances like cholesterol or bilirubin harden in your gallbladder. Your gallbladder stores bile, a digestive fluid that helps break down fats before they enter your intestines.
Gilbert�s syndrome: This is a genetic liver condition that causes your liver not to process bilirubin properly. This causes the bilirubin to build up in your bloodstream.
Liver dysfunction: This can be any condition that affects the function of your liver and causes bilirubin to build up in your blood. This is a result of your liver losing its ability to remove and process bilirubin from your bloodstream. Examples include cirrhosis, liver cancer, or autoimmune hepatitis.
Hepatitis: This happens when your liver becomes inflamed, often due to a viral infection. When it�s inflamed, your liver can�t easily process bilirubin, leading to a buildup of it in your blood.
Bile duct obstruction: Bile ducts connect your liver to your gallbladder and the opening of your small intestine, called the duodenum. They help to move bile, which contains bilirubin, from your liver and gallbladder into your intestines. Bile can�t be drained adequately if these ducts become inflamed or blocked. This can lead to an increased level of bilirubin.
Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy: This is a temporary condition during the last trimester of pregnancy. It causes bile drainage from your liver to either slow down or stop entirely. This makes it harder for your liver to process bilirubin from your blood, leading to high bilirubin levels.
Hemolytic anemia: This happens when blood cells break down too quickly in your bloodstream. It�s sometimes passed down genetically, but autoimmune conditions, an enlarged spleen, or an infection can also cause it.
Bilirubin levels in newborns
Many babies have high bilirubin a few days after birth, causing newborn jaundice. This temporary condition usually resolves on its own within a few weeks.
It happens because newborns have more red blood cells and break them down more quickly, but their livers are not developed enough to keep up.
Before being born, the pregnant person�s liver helps with this task. A newborn�s liver is only about 1%
as active as an adult�s.
In most cases, higher bilirubin levels will lead to jaundice between 1 and 3 days after birth. Bilirubin levels can peak as high as 18 mg/dL on the fourth or fifth day, and jaundice typically clears up within 2 weeks as the liver matures.
Feeding 8 to 12 times per day helps to promote regular bowel movements, which help to remove bilirubin from the body.
If jaundice occurs within the first 24 hours after birth, or if bilirubin levels are especially high or don�t begin to fall on their own, doctors may intervene with treatments such as:
phototherapy
intravenous immunoglobulin treatment
exchange transfusion"
hyperbilirubinemia,hyperbilirubinemia symptoms,"If you have high bilirubin, your symptoms will depend on the underlying cause. You can have mildly high bilirubin and have no symptoms at all.
With moderately high bilirubin, you may only have jaundice, which is a yellowish color in your eyes and skin. Jaundice is the main sign of high bilirubin levels.
Other general signs of illnesses that cause high bilirubin can include:
abdominal pain or swelling
chills
fever
chest pain
weakness
lightheadedness
fatigue
nausea
vomiting
unusually dark urine"
influenza,influenza definition,"Type A influenza is a common infection that can cause widespread flu outbreaks. It can cause fever, body aches, chills, fatigue, and other symptoms.
Influenza � also known as the flu � is a contagious viral infection that attacks your respiratory system.
Influenza viruses that infect humans can be classified into three main groups: A, B, and C. Type A influenza infection can be serious and cause widespread outbreaks and disease.
Common symptoms of type A infection can be confused with other conditions. While in some milder cases the flu can resolve on its own without significant symptoms, severe cases of type A influenza can be life-threatening."
influenza,influenza symptoms,"Unlike a common cold, the flu typically occurs with a sudden onset of symptoms. Common signs of an influenza infection include:
coughing
runny or stuffy nose
sneezing
sore throat
fever
headache
fatigue
chills
body aches
Sometimes, influenza A symptoms may resolve on their own. However, if symptoms persist for more than a week without improvement, schedule a visit with your doctor.
People who are at high risk for flu complications, such as those who are 65 years old and up or who have weakened immune systems, should seek immediate medical treatment. In rare cases, the flu can be deadly.
Left untreated, the flu can cause:
ear infection
diarrhea
nausea
vomiting
dizziness
abdominal pain
chest pain
asthma attack
pneumonia
bronchitis
cardiac issues"
influenza,influenza diagnosis,"Before treating your condition, your doctor will need to check for the influenza virus. The preferred test is the rapid molecular assay. In this procedure, your doctor swabs your nose or throat. The test will detect influenza viral RNA within 30 minutes or less.
Results aren�t always accurate, and your doctor may have to make a diagnosis based on your symptoms or other flu tests."
influenza,influenza treatment,"In some cases, influenza A symptoms can clear on their own with ample rest and fluid intake. In other cases, your doctor may prescribe antiviral medication to fight the infection.
Common antiviral prescriptions include:
zanamivir (Relenza)
oseltamivir (Tamiflu)
peramivir (Rapivab)
These medications, known as neuraminidase inhibitors, reduce the ability of the influenza virus to spread from cell to cell, slowing down the infection process.
Though effective, these medications can cause side effects such as nausea and vomiting. If you begin to experience any of these symptoms or if your condition worsens, stop using the prescription and visit your doctor immediately.
A new medication called baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza), created by a Japanese pharmaceutical company, was approved in October 2018 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
. This antiviral drug helps stop the influenza virus from replicating.
Over-the-counter medication therapy can also ease flu symptoms. Be sure to stay hydrated to loosen mucus in your chest and strengthen your immune system.
How long is it contagious?
If you have the flu, you�re contagious from at least a day before you begin to experience symptoms up through five days after your symptoms begin.
In more severe cases, you could be contagious for even longer after you begin experiencing symptoms. This number can fluctuate if your immune system is weak or undeveloped, specifically in cases of children or older adults."
influenza,influenza prevention,"The best way to prevent the flu is through annual vaccinations. Each flu shot protects against three to four
different influenza viruses within that year�s flu season.
Other ways to prevent spreading this disease include:
washing your hands regularly
avoiding large crowds, specifically during a flu outbreak
covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze
staying home if you develop a fever and for at least 24 hours after it goes away"
dependence,dependence definition,"What is drug dependence?
Drug dependence occurs when you need one or more drugs to function. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) used to distinguish between dependence and abuse. Abuse was considered the mild or early phase of inappropriate drug use that led to dependence. People viewed dependence as a more severe problem than abuse.
The APA replaced �dependence� and �abuse� with �substance use disorder� in the 2013 edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). This diagnosis focuses on the disorder involving the use of the substance."
dependence,dependence symptoms,"You can often determine if an addiction has turned into dependence by looking at behavior. When a person addicted to drugs hasn�t had them for a period of time, this can cause a physical reaction. Physical symptoms of withdrawal occur when the body becomes stressed without the drug. These symptoms include:
anxiety
depression
muscle weakness
nightmares
body aches
sweating
nausea
vomiting"
thrombus,thrombus definition,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a serious condition in which a blood clot forms in a deep vein inside your body. A blood clot is a clump of blood that�s turned into a solid state.
Deep vein blood clots typically form in your thigh or lower leg, but they can also develop in other areas of your body.
Other names associated with this condition may include:"
thrombus,thrombus symptoms,"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
, symptoms of DVT only occur in about half of the people with this condition.
Common DVT symptoms include:
swelling in your foot, ankle, or leg, usually on one side
cramping pain in your affected leg that usually begins in your calf
severe, unexplained pain in your foot and ankle
an area of skin that feels warmer than the skin in the surrounding areas
the skin over the affected area turning pale or reddish, or bluish color, depending on skin tone
People with an upper extremity DVT, or a blood clot in the arm, may not experience symptoms. If they do, common symptoms include:
neck pain
shoulder pain
swelling in the arm or hand
blue- or darker-tinted skin color
pain that moves from the arm to the forearm
weakness in the hand
People may not find out they have DVT until they�ve undergone emergency treatment for a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung).
A pulmonary embolism can happen when a DVT clot has moved from the arm or leg into the lung. When an artery in the lung becomes blocked, it�s life threatening and requires emergency care.
Design by Diego Sabogal"
thrombus,thrombus causes,"DVT is caused by a blood clot. The clot blocks a vein, preventing
blood from properly circulating in your body.
Different factors can lead to a DVT or increase the risk of developing it. They include:
Injury: Damage to a blood vessel�s wall can narrow or block blood flow. A blood clot may form as a result.
Surgery: Blood vessels can be damaged during surgery, leading to the development of a blood clot. Bed rest with little to no movement after surgery may also increase your risk of developing a blood clot.
Reduced mobility or inactivity: When you sit frequently, such as during a long flight, blood can collect in your legs, especially the lower parts. If you cannot move for extended periods, the blood flow in your legs can slow down. This can cause a clot to develop.
Certain medications: Some medications increase the chances your blood will form a clot. These include birth control pills, hormone therapy drugs, glucocorticoids, and antidepressants.
Age: DVT can still happen at any age, but the incidence rises in older ages. Only 1 in 10,000 people younger than age 20 get DVT, but among those older than age 80, it is 1 in 100.
Trauma: Having an injury that damages your veins, like a bone fracture, can cause a blood clot to develop.
Obesity. Being overweight can put more pressure on your legs and pelvis veins.
Pregnancy: Pregnancy increases the risk
of DVT. In fact, pregnant people are 5-10 times more likely
to develop DVT than those who aren�t pregnant.
Family history: Having relatives who have had DVT may make you more likely to get it.
Catheter: Having a catheter placed in a vein can increase the likelihood of a blood clot forming.
Smoking: This is associated with a higher risk of DVT.
Hereditary blood clotting disorders: Having a clotting disorder makes you more susceptible to DVT.
Cancer: Having pancreatic, lung, stomach, or brain cancer, as well as other cancers, puts you at risk
of DVT, especially if you�re undergoing chemotherapy.
In addition, several other health conditions can increase the risk for DVT. These include
inflammatory bowel disease
cardiac problems like high blood pressure and heart failure
sepsis
Covid-19, tuberculosis, and other viral or bacterial illnesses
asthma
sleep apnea
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
diabetes"
thrombus,thrombus complications,"A major complication of DVT is a pulmonary embolism. You can develop a pulmonary embolism if a blood clot moves to your lungs and blocks a blood vessel.
This can cause serious damage to your lungs and other parts of your body. Get immediate medical help if you have signs of a pulmonary embolism. These signs include:
dizziness
sweating
chest pain that gets worse with coughing or inhaling deeply
rapid breathing
coughing up blood
rapid heart rate"
thrombus,thrombus treatment,"DVT is a serious medical condition. Tell your doctor immediately if you think you�re experiencing symptoms of DVT, or go to the closest emergency room. A healthcare professional can check out your symptoms.
DVT treatments focus on keeping the clot from growing. In addition, treatment may help prevent a pulmonary embolism and lower your risk of having more clots.
Medications
Your doctor might prescribe medications to thin your blood. The preferred
treatment is with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as rivaroxaban (Xarelto) or apixaban (Eliquis).
Other drugs a doctor may use include:
heparin
warfarin (Coumadin)
enoxaparin (Lovenox)
fondaparinux (Arixtra)
Blood-thinning medications make it harder for your blood to clot. They also keep
existing clots as small as possible and decrease the chance that you�ll develop more clots.
If blood thinners don�t work or the DVT is severe, your doctor might use thrombolytic drugs. People with upper extremity DVT may also benefit
from this medication.
Thrombolytic drugs work by breaking up clots. You�ll receive these intravenously (through a vein).
Compression stockings
If you�re at high risk of DVT, wearing compression stockings can prevent swelling and might lower your chance of developing clots.
Compression stockings reach just below your knee or right above it. Your doctor may recommend you wear these every day.
Filters
If you cannot take blood thinners, you might need a filter inside the large abdominal vein called the vena cava. This treatment helps prevent pulmonary embolisms by stopping clots from entering your lungs.
Filters do have risks. If they�re left in for too long, they can actually increase
the risk of DVT. Filters should be used for a short-term period until the risk of thromboembolism is reduced, and blood thinners can be used.
Surgery
Your doctor may suggest surgery to remove a DVT clot in your arm or leg. This is typically only recommended with very large blood clots or clots that cause serious issues, like tissue damage.
During a surgical thrombectomy or surgery to remove a blood clot, your surgeon will make an incision into a blood vessel. They�ll locate and remove the clot. Then, they�ll repair the blood vessel and tissue.
In some cases, they may use a small inflating balloon to keep the blood vessel open while they remove the clot. When the clot is found and removed, the balloon is removed with it.
Surgery isn�t without risks, so many doctors will recommend it only in severe cases. Risks include:
infection
damage to the blood vessel
excess bleeding
Home remedies
Once a DVT blood clot is diagnosed, your doctor will likely prescribe medication to help thin the blood or break up the clot.
You can combine the prescribed medication with home remedies to prevent
other complications and reduce the risk of future blood clots.
Move more
If possible, take daily walks to improve blood flow. Shorter, frequent walks are better than one long walk.
Keep your leg or arm elevated
This is especially important for the legs. Blood can pool if your feet are on the ground all day. Use a stool or chair to keep your legs elevated and close to level with your hips.
Wear compression stockings
These specially designed stockings fit tightly around your feet and become gradually looser as they move up your leg to your knee. The compression helps prevent pooling and swelling, and it increases blood flow.
Most people don�t need them, but people at high risk of DVT may find them useful. Compression stockings may be beneficial when you�re traveling.
Eat healthfully
Eating a nutrient-dense and balanced diet is important for helping to avoid life threatening complications.
A diet high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables, such as the Mediterranean diet, may be best for people at risk of DVT or those who�ve had DVT before, but research is needed to support this.
Some vitamins and minerals can interfere with DVT medications. For example, too much vitamin K can bypass warfarin�s ability to thin your blood and prevent a clot.
Review any vitamins or supplements you take with your doctor, and ask about possible medication interactions. It�s also important you talk with your doctor about any foods or nutrients you should avoid."
thrombus,thrombus prevention,"A healthy lifestyle incorporates many necessary changes to prevent blood clots from forming. This includes moving more, quitting smoking, and maintaining a moderate weight.
You can also lower your risk of having DVT by:
managing your blood pressure
giving up smoking
maintaining a moderate weight
Take any blood thinners your doctor prescribes if you�re having surgery, which can lower your chance of developing clots afterward.
The risk of developing DVT during travel becomes higher if you sit for more than 4 hours.
Moving your legs around when you�ve been sitting for a while also helps keep your blood flowing. Walking around after being on bed rest can prevent clots from forming.
Get out of your car during long drives and stretch at regular intervals. Walk in the aisles if you�re flying, taking a train, or riding a bus.
Stretch your legs and feet while you�re sitting. This keeps your blood moving steadily in your calves. Don�t wear tight clothes that can restrict blood flow. Complications of DVT are preventable.
Exercises for DVT
If you have to be seated for long periods, such as on a long flight, you can exercise to keep your legs moving and help circulate blood.
Knee pulls
Bend your leg, and raise your knee toward your chest. Wrap your knee with your arms for a greater stretch. Hold this position for several seconds, then do the same exercise on the other side.
Repeat these stretches several times.

Foot pumps
Place your feet flat on the floor. Keeping the balls of your feet on the floor, raise your heels. Hold for a few seconds, then lower your heels.
Raise the balls of your feet off the floor, keeping your heels in place. Hold for a few seconds, then lower the balls of your feet.
Repeat these pumps several times.

Ankle circles
Lift both feet off the floor. Draw circles with your toes in one direction for a few seconds. Switch directions, and draw circles for a few seconds.
Repeat this exercise several times."
thrombus,thrombus diagnosis,"Your doctor will use your medical history, a thorough physical exam, and one or more diagnostic tests to find or rule out DVT. These tests include:
Ultrasound
This is the most commonly used test for diagnosing DVT. Ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of your arteries and veins to see how blood flows through them.
If a clot is present, your doctor can see the interrupted blood flow and make the diagnosis.
Venogram
If the ultrasound is inconclusive, your doctor may order a venogram. During this test, a dye is injected into the vein in question. Then, an X-ray is taken over the area where your doctor suspects DVT is present.
The dye makes the vein more visible so that interrupted blood flow would be easily seen.
D-dimer test
A D-dimer blood test measures the presence of a substance released when a blood clot breaks apart.
If levels of the substance are high and you have risk factors for DVT, you likely have a clot. If levels are healthy and your risk factors are low, you likely don�t.
A D-dimer blood test can also indicate other factors, such as a pulmonary embolism, stroke, pregnancy, or infection, so your doctor may need to use other tests to be sure of a diagnosis.
Other tests can be used to diagnose DVT if these are not successful."
cholecystitis,cholecystitis definition,"What is chronic cholecystitis?
Cholecystitis is the sudden inflammation of your gallbladder. If this condition persists over time, such as for months, with repeated attacks, or if there are recurrent problems with gallbladder function, it�s known as chronic cholecystitis.
The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ located on the underside of your liver. It stores bile made by the liver and sends it to the small intestine via the common bile duct (CBD) to aid in the digestion of fats. The CBD connects the liver, the gallbladder, and the pancreas to the small intestine. Gallstones blocking the CBD are the leading cause of cholecystitis. This blockage causes bile to build up in the gallbladder, and that buildup causes the gallbladder to become inflamed.
If this happens acutely in the face of chronic inflammation, it is a serious condition. The gallbladder could rupture if it�s not treated properly, and this is considered a medical emergency. Treatment usually involves antibiotics, pain medications, and removal of the gallbladder."
cholecystitis,cholecystitis causes,"This condition usually begins with the formation of gallstones in the gallbladder. According to the Cleveland Clinic, whether you have gallstones may depend on several factors, including:
genetic predisposition
weight
gallbladder activity
dietary habits
Gallstones form when substances in the bile form crystal-like particles. They can range from the size of a grain of sand to the size of a golf ball. The presence of gallstones causes pressure, irritation, and may cause infection. The walls of the gallbladder begin to thicken over time. Eventually, the gallbladder starts to shrink. These changes make it harder for the gallbladder to function properly.
In addition to gallstones, cholecystitis can be due to:
infection of the CBD drainage system
a CBD blockage
excess cholesterol in the gallbladder, which can happen during pregnancy or after rapid weight loss
decreased blood supply to the gallbladder because of diabetes
tumors in the liver or pancreas
tumors in the gallbladder, which is rare
When you experience repeated or prolonged attacks of cholecystitis, it becomes a chronic condition."
cholecystitis,cholecystitis symptoms,"Symptoms of cholecystitis can appear suddenly or develop slowly over a period of years. Most of the time these symptoms appear after a meal that is high in fat.
Symptoms include:
severe abdominal pains that may feel sharp or dull
abdominal cramping and bloating
pain that spreads to your back or below your right shoulder blade
fever
chills
nausea
vomiting
loose, light-colored stools
jaundice, which is when your skin and the whites of your eyes turn yellow
itching
A typical attack can last two or three days, but symptoms of cholecystitis vary widely from person to person. The symptoms appear on the right or middle upper part of your stomach. The pain will usually last for 30 minutes.
Complications can include:
pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas
perforation of the gallbladder as a result of infection
enlarged gallbladder due to inflammation
infection may cause the bile to build up
cancer of the gallbladder (this is a rare, long-term complication)
death of gallbladder tissue (this can lead to a tear and ultimately a burst of the organ)
The symptoms of cholecystitis can be treated at home with pain medication and rest, if you have been properly diagnosed. It�s important that you talk to your doctor first before making the decision to treat at home. You may also take antibiotics and avoid fatty foods.
You should always seek medical attention if you are getting severe pains in your abdomen or if your fever does not break."
cholecystitis,cholecystitis diagnosis,"Your doctor will take your medical history and conduct a physical exam. The symptoms of cholecystitis are similar to those of other conditions, so they must rule out those conditions.
There are tests that can help diagnose cholecystitis:
The CT scan uses X-rays to produce very detailed pictures of your abdomen. This is the most sensitive test, and is likely the best bet in locating the problem.
Your doctor may use an abdominal ultrasound to view your gallbladder and liver. This will help them visualize stones and duct obstructions.
Blood tests can identify infections in the bloodstream.
In cholescintigraphy, or a HIDA scan, an injection of a small amount of radioactive material can help identify abnormal contractions or obstructions of your gallbladder and bile ducts. This is also an accurate method of locating the problem. It can take anywhere from an hour to four hours to get your results back.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography involves using an endoscope (a long, flexible tube inserted down your throat), dye, and an X-ray to thoroughly examine your organs and find defects or problems.
In a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, your doctor will insert contrast dye into your liver with a needle. This allows your doctor to see your bile ducts on X-ray."
cholecystitis,cholecystitis treatment,"The specific cause of your attack will determine the course of treatment. Your doctor will also consider your overall health when choosing your treatment. The options include:
broad-spectrum antibiotics for fighting infection
oral dissolution therapy using medications to help dissolve gallstones (this is typically a last resort, reserved for individuals who cannot undergo surgery)
pain relievers for controlling pain during treatment
Surgery is often the course of action in cases of chronic cholecystitis. Today, gallbladder surgery is generally done laparoscopically. Your surgeon will make small incisions in your abdomen and insert small surgical tools to perform the surgery. In most cases, the surgery is an outpatient procedure, which means a shorter recovery time.
Your healthcare team will advise you about lifestyle and dietary guidelines that can also improve your condition.
Lifestyle and diet changes
Having cholecystitis means you should make important changes to your diet. Upon recovery, eating five to six smaller meals a day is recommended. This allows the bile in your digestive tract to normalize. One big meal can throw off the system and produce a spasm in the gallbladder and bile ducts.
Stick to a low-fat diet with lean proteins, such as poultry or fish. Avoid fatty meats, fried food, and any high-fat foods, including whole milk products."
cholecystitis,cholecystitis prevention,"If you�ve had one or more bouts of cholecystitis, speak to your doctor to learn about changes you can make to avoid chronic cholecystitis. Ask about dietary guidelines that may include reducing how much fat you eat. Regular exercise is often helpful.
Gallstones are the main cause of cholecystitis. You can lower your risk of developing more gallstones by maintaining a healthy weight. If you need to lose weight, try to do it slowly because rapid weight loss can increase your risk of developing gallstones."
hernia hiatal,hernia hiatal definition,"A hiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of your stomach pushes up through your diaphragm and into your chest region. Hiatal hernias don�t always cause symptoms. Hiatal hernia symptoms may include heartburn, acid reflux, and chest pain."
hernia hiatal,hernia hiatal symptoms,"It�s rare for even fixed hiatal hernias to cause symptoms. If you do experience any symptoms, they�re usually caused by stomach acid, bile, or air entering your esophagus. Common symptoms include:
heartburn that gets worse when you lean over or lie down
acid reflux or GERD
chest pain or epigastric pain
trouble swallowing
belching"
hernia hiatal,hernia hiatal treatment,"Most cases of hiatal hernia don�t require treatment. The presence of symptoms usually determines treatment. If you have acid reflux and heartburn, you may be treated with medications or, if those don�t work, surgery.
Medications
Medications your doctor may prescribe include:
over-the-counter (OTC) antacids to neutralize stomach acid
OTC or prescription H2-receptor blockers that lower acid production
OTC or prescription proton pump inhibitors to prevent acid production, giving your esophagus time to heal
Diet
Hiatal hernia causes
acid reflux symptoms. Changing your diet can reduce your symptoms. It may help to eat smaller meals several times a day instead of three large meals. You should also avoid eating meals or snacks within a few hours of going to bed.
There are also certain foods that may increase your risk of heartburn. Consider avoiding
:
spicy foods
chocolate
foods made with tomatoes
caffeine
onions
citrus fruits
alcohol
Other ways to reduce your symptoms include:
stopping smoking
raising the head of your bed by at least 6 inches
avoiding bending over or lying down after eating"
hernia hiatal,hernia hiatal causes,"The exact cause of many hiatal hernias is not known. In some people, injury or other damage may weaken muscle tissue. This makes it possible for your stomach to push through your diaphragm.
Another cause is putting too much pressure (repeatedly) on the muscles around your stomach. This can happen when:
coughing
vomiting
straining during bowel movements
lifting heavy objects
Some people are also born with an abnormally large hiatus. This makes it easier for the stomach to move through it.
Factors that can increase your risk of a hiatal hernia include:
obesity
aging
smoking
You may not avoid a hiatal hernia entirely, but you can avoid making a hernia worse by:
losing excess weight
not straining during bowel movements
getting help when lifting heavy objects
avoiding tight belts and certain abdominal exercises"
hernia hiatal,hernia hiatal diagnosis,"Several tests
can diagnose a hiatal hernia.
Barium swallow
Your doctor may have you drink a liquid with barium in it before taking an X-ray. This X-ray provides a clear silhouette of your upper digestive tract. The image allows your doctor to see the location of your stomach. If it�s protruding through your diaphragm, you have a hiatal hernia.
Endoscopy
Your doctor may perform an endoscopy. They�ll slide a thin tube in your throat and pass it down to your esophagus and stomach. Your doctor will then be able to see if your stomach is pushing through your diaphragm. Any strangulation or obstruction will also be visible."
hernia hiatal,hernia hiatal prevention,"Doctors don�t know exactly what causes hiatal hernias or how to prevent them from happening.
But certain factors like living with obesity and smoking may increase your risk of a hiatial hernia, so maintaining a moderate weight and quitting smoking may help decrease your risk of developing one."
migraine disorders,migraine disorders definition,"Migraine is a neurological condition that typically causes painful headache attacks that occur with additional symptoms, such as sensitivity to light, sound, smell, or touch.
More than just the cause of �really bad headaches,� migraine is a neurological condition that can cause multiple symptoms. While intense, debilitating headaches frequently characterize it, additional symptoms may include:
The condition often runs in families and can affect all ages. People assigned female at birth are more likely than people assigned male at birth to be diagnosed with migraine.
The diagnosis of migraine is determined based on clinical history, reported symptoms, and by ruling out other causes. The most common categories of migraine headaches (or attacks) are episodic versus chronic, and then those without aura and those with aura."
migraine disorders,migraine disorders symptoms,"Migraine symptoms may begin 1 to 2 days before the headache itself. This is known as the prodrome stage. Symptoms during this stage can include:
food cravings
depression
fatigue or low energy
frequent yawning
hyperactivity
irritability
neck stiffness
In migraine with aura, the aura occurs after the prodrome stage. During an aura, you may have problems with your vision, sensation, movement, and speech. Examples of these problems include:
difficulty speaking clearly
feeling a prickling or tingling sensation in your face, arms, or legs
seeing shapes, light flashes, or bright spots
temporarily losing your vision
The next phase is known as the attack phase. This is the most acute or severe of the phases when the actual migraine pain occurs. In some people, this can overlap or occur during an aura. Attack phase symptoms can last anywhere from hours to days. Symptoms of migraine can vary from person to person.
Some symptoms may include:
increased sensitivity to light and sound
nausea
dizziness or feeling faint
pain on one side of your head, either on the left side, right side, front, or back, or in your temples
pulsing and throbbing head pain
vomiting
After the attack phase, a person will often experience the postdrome phase. During this phase, there are usually changes in mood and feelings. These can range from feeling euphoric and extremely happy to feeling very fatigued and apathetic. A mild, dull headache may persist.
The length and intensity of these phases can occur to different degrees in different people. Sometimes, a phase gets skipped, and a migraine attack may occur without causing a headache."
migraine disorders,migraine disorders causes,"Researchers haven�t identified a definitive cause for migraine. But they still believe the condition is due to �abnormal� brain activity that affects nerve signaling, and chemicals and blood vessels in the brain.
There are also many migraine triggers that are continually reported, including:
bright lights
severe heat, or other extremes in weather
dehydration
changes in barometric pressure
hormone changes in people assigned female at birth, like estrogen and progesterone fluctuations during menstruation, pregnancy, or menopause
excess stress
loud sounds
intense physical activity
skipping meals
changes in sleep patterns
use of certain medications, like oral contraceptives or nitroglycerin
unusual smells
certain foods
smoking
alcohol use
traveling
If you experience a migraine attack, your doctor may ask you to keep a headache journal. Writing down what you were doing, what foods you ate, and what medications you took before your migraine attack began can help identify your triggers."
migraine disorders,migraine disorders treatment,"Migraine can�t be cured, but your doctor can help you manage migraine attacks by giving you the tools to treat symptoms when they occur, which may lead to fewer attacks in general. Treatment can also help make migraine less severe.
Your treatment plan depends on:
your age
how often you have migraines attacks
the type of migraine you have
how severe they are � based on how long they last, how much pain you have, and how often they keep you from going to school or work
whether they include nausea or vomiting, as well as other symptoms
other health conditions you may have and other medications you may take
Your treatment plan may include a combination of:
lifestyle adjustments, including stress management and avoiding migraine triggers
OTC pain or migraine medications, like Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen (Tylenol)
prescription migraine medications that you take every day to help prevent migraine headaches and reduce how often you have headaches
prescription migraine medications that you take as soon as an attack starts to keep it from becoming severe and to ease symptoms
prescription medications to help with nausea or vomiting
hormone therapy if migraines seem to occur in relation to your menstrual cycle
counseling
alternative care, which may include meditation, acupressure, or acupuncture
If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here.
Medication
Medications can be used to either prevent a migraine attack from happening or treat it once it occurs. You may be able to get relief with OTC medication. But if OTC medications aren�t effective, your doctor may decide to prescribe other medications.
The severity of your migraine and any other health conditions you have will determine which treatment is right for you.
Acute medications � taken as soon as you suspect a migraine attack is coming � include:
NSAIDs: These medications, like ibuprofen or aspirin, are typically used in mild-to-moderate attacks that don�t include nausea or vomiting.
Triptans: These medications, like sumatriptan, eletriptan, and rizatriptan, are typically the first line of defense for individuals who have nerve pain as a symptom of their migraine attacks.
Antiemetics: These medications, like metoclopramide, chlorpromazine, and prochlorperazine, are typically used with NSAIDs to help decrease nausea.
Ergot alkaloids: These medications, like Migranal and Ergomar, aren�t prescribed that often and are usually reserved for individuals who don�t respond to triptans or analgesics.
Preventative medications � prescribed to people whose migraine attacks can be debilitating or happen more than four times a month � are taken once a day, or every 3 months via injection. These medications include:
Antihypertensives: These drugs are prescribed for high blood pressure and can also help with migraine attacks. Beta-blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers (candesartan) are some examples of antihypertensive drugs used for migraine prevention.
Anticonvulsants: Certain anti-seizure medications may also be able to prevent migraine attacks.
Antidepressants: Some antidepressants, like amitriptyline and venlafaxine, may also be able to prevent migraine attacks.
Botox: Botox injections are administered to the head and neck muscles every 3 months.
Calcitonin gene-related peptide treatments: These treatments are administered either via injection or through an IV and work to prevent a migraine attack from developing."
migraine disorders,migraine disorders prevention,"If you�ve been diagnosed with migraine, there are a few options that may help you prevent a migraine attack. Some may work better for you than others:
Learn the foods, smells, and situations that trigger your migraine attacks and avoid those things when possible.
Stay hydrated. Dehydration can lead to both dizziness and headaches.
Avoid skipping meals when possible.
Focus on quality sleep. A good night�s sleep is important for overall health.
Quit smoking.
Make it a priority to reduce stress in your life.
Invest time and energy in developing relaxation skills.
Exercise regularly. Exercise has been linked to lowered stress levels."
migraine disorders,migraine disorders diagnosis,"Doctors diagnose migraine by listening to your symptoms, taking a thorough medical and family history, and performing a physical exam to rule out other potential causes.
Imaging scans, like a CT scan or MRI, can rule out other causes, including:
tumors
abnormal brain structures
stroke"
pancytopenia,pancytopenia definition,"Overview
Pancytopenia is a condition in which a person�s body has too few red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Each of these blood cell types has a different job in the body:
If you have pancytopenia, you have a combination of three different blood diseases:
Because your body needs all of these blood cells, pancytopenia can be very serious. It can even be life-threatening if you don�t treat it."
pancytopenia,pancytopenia symptoms,"Mild pancytopenia often doesn�t cause symptoms. Your doctor might discover it while doing a blood test for another reason.
More severe pancytopenia can cause symptoms including:
shortness of breath
pale skin
fatigue
weakness
fever
dizziness
easy bruising
bleeding
tiny purple spots on your skin, called petechiae
larger purple spots on your skin, called purpura
bleeding gums and nosebleeds
fast heart rate
If you or someone close to you has any of the following serious symptoms and pancytopenia, get medical care right away:
fever over 101�F (38.3�C)
seizures
heavy bleeding
severe shortness of breath
confusion
loss of consciousness"
pancytopenia,pancytopenia causes,"Pancytopenia starts because of a problem with your bone marrow. This spongy tissue inside bones is where blood cells are produced. Diseases and exposure to certain drugs and chemicals can lead to this bone marrow damage.
You�re more likely to develop pancytopenia if you have one of these conditions:
cancers that affect the bone marrow, such as:
leukemia
multiple myeloma
Hodgkin�s or non-Hodgkin�s lymphoma
myelodysplastic syndromes
megaloblastic anemia, a condition in which your body produces larger-than-normal, immature red blood cells and you have a low red blood cell count
aplastic anemia, a condition in which your body stops making enough new blood cells
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare blood disease that causes red blood cells to be destroyed
viral infections, such as:
Epstein-Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis
cytomegalovirus
HIV
hepatitis
malaria
sepsis (a blood infection)
diseases that damage bone marrow, such as Gaucher disease
damage from chemotherapy or radiation treatments for cancer
exposure to chemicals in the environment, such as radiation, arsenic, or benzene
bone marrow disorders that run in families
vitamin deficiencies, such as lack of vitamin B-12 or folate
enlargement of your spleen, known as splenomegaly
liver disease
excess alcohol use that damages your liver
autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus
In about half of all cases, doctors can�t find a cause for pancytopenia. This is called idiopathic pancytopenia."
pancytopenia,pancytopenia causes,"Complications from pancytopenia stem from a lack of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. These problems can include:
excess bleeding if platelets are affected
increased risk for infections if white blood cells are affected
Severe pancytopenia can be life-threatening."
pancytopenia,pancytopenia diagnosis,"If your doctor suspects you have pancytopenia, they�ll likely recommend that you see a hematologist � a specialist who treats blood diseases. This specialist will want to learn your family history and personal medical history. During the exam, the doctor will ask about your symptoms and look at your ears, nose, throat, mouth, and skin.
The doctor will also do a complete blood count (CBC). This test measures the amount of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. If the CBC is abnormal, you might need a peripheral blood smear. This test places a drop of your blood on a slide to look at the different types of blood cells it contains.
To look for a problem with your bone marrow, your doctor will likely do a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. In this test, your doctor uses a needle to remove a small amount of liquid and tissue from inside your bone that can then be tested and examined in a lab.
Your doctor might also do separate tests to look for the cause of pancytopenia. These tests can include blood tests to check for infections or leukemia. You might also need a CT scan or other imaging test to look for cancer or other problems with your organs."
pancytopenia,pancytopenia treatment,"Your doctor will treat the problem that caused pancytopenia. This might include taking you off a medicine or stopping your exposure to a certain chemical. If your immune system is attacking your bone marrow, you�ll get medicine to dampen your body�s immune response.
Treatments for pancytopenia include:
drugs to stimulate blood cell production in your bone marrow
blood transfusions to replace red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets
antibiotics to treat an infection
a bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, which replaces damaged bone marrow with healthy stem cells that rebuild bone marrow"
pancytopenia,pancytopenia prevention,"Some causes of pancytopenia, like cancer or inherited bone marrow diseases, aren�t preventable. You may be able to prevent certain types of infection with good hygiene practices and by avoiding contact with anyone who is sick. You can also avoid chemicals that are known to cause this condition."
cholelithiasis or biliary calculus,cholelithiasis or biliary calculus definition,"Gallstones are deposits of digestive fluid made of solidified substances found in bile, like cholesterol. They are common and may or may not produce symptoms. People with symptoms usually need to have their gallbladders taken out.
Read on to learn more about gallstones, the symptoms they can cause, and how to treat them."
cholelithiasis or biliary calculus,cholelithiasis or biliary calculus symptoms,"Gallstones can lead to pain in the upper right abdomen or the center of your stomach. You may experience gallbladder pain from time to time after you eat foods that are high in fat, such as fried foods, but the pain can occur at almost any time.
Pain caused by gallstone issues usually lasts for only a few hours, but it can feel severe.
If gallstones are left untreated or unidentified, the symptoms may increase to include:
a high temperature
rapid heartbeat
yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)
itchy skin
diarrhea
chills
confusion
a loss of appetite
These symptoms can be signs of a gallbladder infection, or inflammation of the gallbladder, liver, or pancreas.
Because gallstone symptoms may mimic the symptoms of other serious issues like appendicitis and pancreatitis, no matter what, if you�re dealing with one or more of these issues � it�s time to see a doctor or get yourself to the ER.
If you need help finding a urologist, then check out our FindCare tool here.
Asymptomatic gallstones
Gallstones themselves don�t cause pain. Rather, pain occurs when gallstones block the movement of bile from the gallbladder.
According to the American College of Gastroenterology, about 80 percent of people who have gallstones have �silent gallstones.� This means they don�t experience pain or have symptoms. In these cases, your doctor may discover the gallstones from X-rays or during abdominal surgery."
cholelithiasis or biliary calculus,cholelithiasis or biliary calculus causes,"The actual cause of gallstones is thought to be due to a chemical imbalance of bile inside of the gallbladder. While researchers still aren�t clear about what exactly causes that imbalance to happen, there are a few possible reasons:
Too much cholesterol in your bile
Having too much cholesterol in your bile can lead to yellow cholesterol stones. These hard stones may develop if your liver makes more cholesterol than your bile can dissolve.
Too much bilirubin in your bile
Bilirubin is a chemical produced during the normal breakdown of red blood cells. After it�s created, it passes through the liver and is eventually excreted out of the body.
Some conditions, such as liver damage and certain blood disorders, cause your liver to produce more bilirubin than it should. Pigment gallstones form when your gallbladder can�t break down the excess bilirubin. These hard stones are often dark brown or black.
Concentrated bile due to a full gallbladder
Your gallbladder needs to be able to empty its bile to function properly. If it fails to empty its bile content, the bile becomes overly concentrated, which can cause stones to form."
cholelithiasis or biliary calculus,cholelithiasis or biliary calculus treatment,"Most of the time, you won�t need treatment for gallstones unless they cause you pain. Sometimes you can pass gallstones without even noticing. If you�re in pain, your doctor will likely recommend surgery. In rare cases, medication may be used.
If you�re at high risk for surgery complications, there are a few nonsurgical ways to attempt to treat gallstones. However, if surgery isn�t performed, your gallstones may come back � even with additional treatment. This means you may need to keep an eye on your condition for the majority of your life.
Surgery
Cholecystectomy, which is surgery to remove the gallbladder, is one of the most common operations
performed on adults in the United States. Because the gallbladder isn�t an essential organ, it�s possible to live a healthy life without it.
There are two types of cholecystectomy:
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This is a common surgery that requires general anesthesia. The surgeon will usually make three or four incisions in your abdomen. They�ll then insert a small, lighted device into one of the incisions, check for stones, and carefully remove your gallbladder. You can usually go home on the day of the procedure or the day after if you have no complications.
Open cholecystectomy.This surgery is typically performed when the gallbladder is inflamed, infected, or scarred. This surgery may also happen if problems occur during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
You may experience loose or watery stools after gallbladder removal. Removing a gallbladder involves rerouting the bile from the liver to the small intestine. Bile no longer goes through the gallbladder and it becomes less concentrated. The immediate result is a laxative effect that can cause diarrhea, but this issue should resolve on its own for most people.
Nonsurgical treatments
If surgery can�t be performed, such as if the patient is a much older individual, there are a few other ways doctors can try to get rid of your gallstones.
Oral dissolution therapy typically includes using the medications ursodiol (Actigall) and chenodiol (Chenix) to break up gallstones. These medications contain bile acids, which work to break up the stones. This treatment is best suited for breaking up cholesterol stones and can take many months or years to work completely.
Shock wave lithotripsy is another option. A lithotripter is a machine that generates shock waves that pass through a person. These shock waves can break gallstones into smaller pieces.
Percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder involves placing a sterile needle into the gallbladder to aspirate (draw out) bile. A tube is then inserted to help with additional drainage. This procedure isn�t typically a first line of defense and tends to be an option for individuals who may not be suited for other procedures."
cholelithiasis or biliary calculus,cholelithiasis or biliary calculus risks,"Some risk factors for gallstones are related to diet, while other factors are not as controllable. Uncontrollable risk factors are things like age, race, sex, and family history.
Lifestyle risk factors
living with obesity
a diet high in fat or cholesterol and low in fiber
undergoing rapid weight loss
living with type 2 diabetes
Genetic risk factors
being born female
being of Native American or Mexican descent
having a family history of gallstones
being 60 years or older
Medical risk factors
living with cirrhosis
being pregnant
taking certain medications to lower cholesterol
taking medications with a high estrogen content (like certain birth controls)
While some medications may increase your risk of gallstones, don�t stop taking them unless you have discussed it with your doctor and have their approval."
cholelithiasis or biliary calculus,cholelithiasis or biliary calculus diagnosis,"Your doctor will perform a physical examination that includes checking your eyes and skin for visible changes in color. A yellowish tint may be a sign of jaundice, the result of too much bilirubin in your body.
The exam may involve using diagnostic tests that help your doctor see inside your body. These tests include:
Ultrasound. An ultrasound produces images of your abdomen. It�s the preferred imaging method to confirm that you have gallstone disease. It can also show abnormalities associated with acute cholecystitis.
Abdominal CT scan. This imaging test takes pictures of your liver and abdominal region.
Gallbladder radionuclide scan. This important scan takes about one hour to complete. A specialist injects a radioactive substance into your veins. The substance travels through your blood to the liver and gallbladder. On a scan, it can reveal evidence to suggest infection or blockage of the bile ducts from stones.
Blood tests. Your doctor may order blood tests that measure the amount of bilirubin in your blood. The tests also help determine how well your liver is functioning."
cholelithiasis or biliary calculus,cholelithiasis or biliary calculus prevention,"While there is no foolproof way to completely prevent gallstones, cholesterol seems to play a major role in their formation. If you have a family history of gallstones, your doctor may advise you to limit foods with a high saturated fat content. Some of these foods include:
fatty meat, like sausage and bacon
cakes and cookies
lard and cream
certain cheeses
Because people living with obesity are more predisposed to gallstones, keeping your weight within a moderate range is another way to limit the possibility of their formation."
tachycardia sinus,tachycardia sinus definition,"Sinus tachycardia refers to a faster-than-usual heart rhythm. It can occur with exercise, anxiety, or stress, but it can sometimes signal an underlying health condition."
tachycardia sinus,tachycardia sinus causes,"In some situations, sinus tachycardia can be completely natural. For example, a fast heart rate is expected during strenuous exercise or after being startled.
Other causes of sinus tachycardia may include:
anxiety or emotional distress
fever
some medications, such as those used in allergy or mental health treatment
pain
stimulants, such as caffeine or nicotine
recreational drugs, such as cocaine
Other potential but less common causes of sinus tachycardia may include the following underlying health conditions:
anemia
an infection
damage to your heart muscle, such as from a previous heart attack
hyperthyroidism
low blood pressure
lung disease
pulmonary embolism
severe bleeding
Doctors aren�t sure about the exact cause of IST, but it likely involves a combination of factors. These may include:
a problem with your sinus node
unusual nerve signaling that causes your heart rate to increase
dysfunction of the nerves that work to lower your heart rate"
tachycardia sinus,tachycardia sinus symptoms,"In most cases
, sinus tachycardia is asymptomatic (you don�t feel any symptoms). However, it�s possible to experience the following symptoms related to this condition:
heart palpitations
chest pain
dizziness or lightheadedness
fainting
breathing difficulties"
tachycardia sinus,tachycardia sinus treatment,"Occasional sinus tachycardia from exercise and other factors that cause short-term increases in your heart rate generally don�t require treatment. However, a doctor may consider treatment if you have a consistently higher heart rate than typical, especially during times of rest.
First, a doctor will need to determine the underlying cause of sinus tachycardia before prescribing treatment. Depending on how fast your heart rate is, a doctor might prescribe beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers to lower your heart rate.
In severe cases that don�t respond to medication or lifestyle changes, you may need a cardiac ablation procedure. This involves using energy to destroy a tiny part of the heart tissue in the area causing tachycardia."
tachycardia sinus,tachycardia sinus diagnosis,"To diagnose sinus tachycardia, a doctor may order tests to measure how your heart is working. These may include:
an electrocardiogram (EKG), which measures electrical activity in your heart
a Holter monitor, which measures your heart rate over 24 hours
chest X-rays
pulse oximetry
blood testing for cardiac enzymes, glucose, and complete blood count (CBC)"
tachycardia sinus,tachycardia sinus prevention,"Preventing sinus tachycardia may depend on treating any underlying causes.
For example, if you have hyperthyroidism and it�s causing a higher-than-typical heart rate, then treating your overactive thyroid gland may help prevent sinus tachycardia.
In other cases, you may be able to prevent sinus tachycardia with certain lifestyle changes. You may consider talking with a doctor to see if the following strategies may help:
limiting caffeine intake
limiting or avoiding alcohol
quitting smoking, if you smoke
participating in an exercise program
eating a heart-healthy diet
achieving or maintaining a moderate weight
managing stress"
ileus,ileus definition,"Your intestines are about 28 feet long. This means the foods you eat have a long way to travel before they�re fully digested and excreted.
Your intestines complete this task using muscle contractions that move in a wave-like motion. Known as peristalsis, these muscle contractions move your digested food forward.
However, if something such as muscle or nerve problems slows down or blocks this motion, the result can be a major traffic jam in your intestines.
Ileus is the medical term for this lack of movement somewhere in the intestines that leads to a buildup and potential blockage of food material.
An ileus can lead to an intestinal obstruction. This means no food material, gas, or liquids can get through.
It can occur as a side effect after surgery. However, there are other causes of this condition.
An ileus is a serious concern. However, people with an ileus often don�t know that food is building up in their intestines, so they continue to eat. This pushes more and more material toward the buildup.
Without treatment, the ileus can perforate or tear the intestine. This causes bowel contents � which have high levels of bacteria � to leak into areas of your body cavity. This can be deadly.
If an ileus does occur, it�s important to get treatment as quickly as possible."
ileus,ileus causes,"An ileus is common after surgery because people are often prescribed medication that can slow intestinal movement. This is a type of paralytic ileus.
In this instance, the intestine is not blocked. Rather, it isn�t moving properly. The result is little to no movement of digested food through your intestines.
Examples of medications that can cause a paralytic ileus include:
hydromorphone (Dilaudid)
morphine
oxycodone
tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline and imipramine (Tofranil)
However, there are several other possible causes of an ileus. These include:
intestinal cancer
diverticulitis
Parkinson�s disease, which affects muscles and nerves in the intestines
Crohn�s disease, which rarely causes a blockage but may cause the intestinal walls to thicken due to autoimmune inflammation
These are the most common causes of an ileus in adults. Children can also have an ileus.
Intussusception is the most common cause of an ileus in children. This is when a part of the intestine �telescopes� or slides into itself.
Gastrointestinal symptoms are the most common signs of an ileus. Your stomach and intestines will start to fill with gas that can�t pass out the rectum. This causes the abdomen to take on a tight and swollen appearance.
If you experience these symptoms, especially after surgery, it�s important to seek immediate medical attention."
ileus,ileus symptoms,"An ileus can cause extreme abdominal discomfort.
Symptoms associated with an ileus include:
abdominal cramping
appetite loss
feeling of fullness
constipation
inability to pass gas
abdominal swelling
nausea
vomiting, especially with stool-like contents"
ileus,ileus diagnosis,"Your doctor will usually first listen to a description of your symptoms. You�ll likely be asked about any history of medical conditions, prescribed medications, and surgeries, especially recent procedures.
Your doctor may then conduct a physical exam, looking at your abdomen for signs of swelling or tightness. Your doctor will also listen with a stethoscope to your abdomen for typical bowel sounds.
If your bowels aren�t moving because of an ileus, your doctor may not hear anything or may hear excessive bowel sounds.
Imaging studies are usually ordered after a thorough physical exam. These can indicate where an ileus is located by showing a buildup of gas, an enlarged intestine, or even an obstruction. Your doctor may use these to identify areas where your bowel content seems to be concentrated.
Examples of imaging studies include:
Plain film X-ray. This may show signs of trapped gas and possibly the obstruction, but plain film X-rays aren�t always the most conclusive way to diagnose an ileus.
CT scan. This scan provides more detailed X-ray images to help your doctor identify the potential area where the ileus is located. A CT scan typically uses contrast agents injected intravenously or taken orally.
Ultrasound. An ultrasound is more commonly used to identify an ileus in children.
In some instances, your doctor may use a diagnostic procedure known as an air or barium enema.
During this procedure, the doctor inserts air or barium sulfate, a radiopaque substance, through your rectum into your colon. While the doctor does this, a technician takes X-rays of your abdomen. The air or barium shows up on the X-ray to help the technician view any potential obstruction.
In some children, this procedure can treat an ileus caused by intussusception."
ileus,ileus risks,"According to 2015 research, ileus is the second
most common reason for hospital readmission in the first 30 days after surgery. An ileus is more likely if you�ve recently had abdominal surgery.
Surgical procedures on the abdomen that involve handling the intestines commonly cause a stoppage of intestinal movement for a period of time. This allows the surgeon to access your intestines.
Sometimes normal peristalsis can be slow to return. Other people are more likely to later experience scar tissue formation that can also lead to an ileus.
A number of medical conditions can increase your risk of ileus. They include:
electrolyte imbalance, such as those involving potassium and calcium
history of intestinal injury or trauma
history of intestinal disorder, such as Crohn�s disease and diverticulitis
sepsis
history of exposure to high-energy radiation (irradiation) near the abdomen
peripheral artery disease
rapid weight loss
Aging also naturally slows down how fast the intestines move. An older adult is at greater risk for ileus, especially since they tend to take more medications that could potentially slow the movement of material through the intestines."
ileus,ileus causes,"An ileus can develop into a serious and potentially life threatening situation.
Two of the most severe complications are necrosis and peritonitis.
Necrosis
Necrosis is the untimely death of cells or tissue. It can happen when an obstruction cuts off the blood supply to the intestine.
Without blood, oxygen cannot get to the tissue, causing it to die. Dead tissue weakens the intestinal wall, making it easy for the intestine to tear and leak bowel contents. This is known as a bowel perforation.
Peritonitis
A bowel perforation due to necrosis can cause peritonitis. This is a serious inflammation in the abdominal cavity caused by bacteria or fungus.
Your bowel contains many bacteria, like E. coli. The bacteria are supposed to remain in your intestines, not roam free in your body cavity. Bacterial peritonitis can turn into sepsis, a life threatening condition that can result in shock and organ failure."
ileus,ileus prevention,"Most of the risk factors associated with an ileus, such as injury or chronic illness, are not preventable.
If you�re going to have surgery, the possibility of getting an ileus should be considered. However, it should not keep you from having needed surgery.
Being aware of the symptoms of an ileus is important in seeking prompt treatment to keep it from getting worse."
adhesion,adhesion definition,"Gallbladder adhesions happen when scar tissue develops around your gallbladder after surgery or an episode of inflammation.
Gallbladder adhesions are bands of scar tissue that form on your gallbladder. This tough adhesive tissue causes your gallbladder to stick to surrounding abdominal tissues. Gallbladder adhesions typically develop after abdominal surgery or when a condition such as gallstones causes inflammation in your gallbladder.
Researchers estimate that about 90%
of adhesions in the abdominal cavity, including gallbladder adhesions, result from abdominal surgery. Gallbladder adhesions often don�t cause symptoms but may complicate future gallbladder surgery.
This article takes a deep look at gallbladder adhesions. You�ll learn what they are, when they�re most likely to develop, and how they affect your health."
adhesion,adhesion symptoms,"In many cases, abdominal adhesions don�t cause any noticeable symptoms or need treatment. But in some cases, they may cause general abdominal symptoms such as pain and cramping."
adhesion,adhesion causes,"Adhesions are the result of your body creating scar tissue, which it does when it�s healing from an injury.
Gallbladder adhesions can form after surgery or as a result of conditions such as acute cholecystitis. Acute cholecystitis is the sudden inflammation of your gallbladder, typically caused by gallstones. Adhesions usually develop within 96 hours
of this inflammatory event.
About 90%
of people who undergo open abdominal surgery develop some abdominal adhesions. An open surgery is any abdominal surgery performed through large incisions, such as gallbladder removal or cesarean delivery.
Adhesions are less common among people who receive laparoscopic surgery, which is the method used in most gallbladder procedures today. Laparoscopic surgery involves making small incisions and using a thin tube with a camera and other small surgical tools. Weight loss surgery and laparotomy are other common abdominal laparoscopic procedures."
adhesion,adhesion complications,"The gold standard treatment
for sudden gallbladder inflammation is laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the removal of the gallbladder through a small incision.
The formation of adhesions between the gallbladder and other tissues, such as the omentum or bowel, can complicate laparoscopic surgery. When surgeons cut through adhesions, they risk damaging your gallbladder or bile duct.
Surgeons may have to switch from laparoscopic surgery to more invasive open surgery if they discover adhesions during your gallbladder procedure. This helps them ensure that they can access your gallbladder safely.
Researchers estimate that 4�15% of laparoscopic gallbladder removal surgeries must be converted to open surgery. Gallbladder adhesions are one of the main reasons for conversion.
Bowel obstruction
Some abdominal adhesions can cause bowel obstruction, which can be life threatening. Possible symptoms include:
severe abdominal pain
constipation
inability to pass gas
nausea and vomiting
bloating
It�s critical to seek immediate medical attention any time you develop severe abdominal pain and an inability to pass gas."
adhesion,adhesion treatment,"Adhesions are common after abdominal surgery. Surgeons often won�t perform laparoscopic gallbladder surgery if you have a history of abdominal surgery due to the high risk of adhesions.
Types of surgeries that may cause gallbladder adhesions include:
small intestine or stomach ulcer surgery
major bowel surgery
major blood vessel surgery
emergency abdominal surgery
Surgeries that involve a small incision, such as an appendectomy, rarely interfere with successful laparoscopic gallbladder surgery.
Doctors may be able to see whether you have gallbladder adhesions before your surgery by using a type of imaging called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
Researchers in a 2019 study sought to find out whether an elevated white blood cell count in people with an inflamed gallbladder might be associated with a higher risk of gallbladder adhesions. They did not find a significant correlation."
delusion,delusion definition,"The exact cause of psychosis isn�t always clear. It�s important to seek help if you experience hallucinations, delusions, or trouble thinking clearly. Most people recover with treatment, such as therapy and medication.
Psychosis is a combination of symptoms resulting in an impaired relationship with reality. It can be a symptom of serious mental health disorders. People who are experiencing psychosis may have either hallucinations or delusions.
Hallucinations are sensory experiences that occur within the absence of an actual stimulus. For example, a person having an auditory hallucination may hear their mother yelling at them when their mother isn�t around. Or someone having a visual hallucination may see something, like a person in front of them, who isn�t actually there.
The person experiencing psychosis may also have thoughts that are contrary to actual evidence. These thoughts are known as delusions. Some people with psychosis may also experience loss of motivation and social withdrawal.
These experiences can be frightening. They may also cause people who are experiencing psychosis to hurt themselves or others.
It�s important to get medical help right away if you or someone else is experiencing symptoms of psychosis."
delusion,delusion symptoms,"According to the National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH)
, there are warning signs that may appear before psychosis develops. These can include:
a sudden drop in school work or job performance
trouble thinking clearly
difficulty concentrating
feeling paranoid or suspicious of others
withdrawing from friends and loved ones
an influx of strange, new feelings, or no feeling at all
a disinterest in personal grooming
difficulty separating reality from non-reality
trouble communicating
If someone is experiencing an episode of psychosis, the main symptoms
include:
hallucinations
delusions
disorganized behavior (behavior that does not seem to make sense, or that is impulsive)
negative symptoms (seemingly having no emotion, lack of interest in activities previously enjoyed, an ungroomed appearance, etc.)
catatonia (a �frozen� appearance)
Suicide prevention
Call 911 or your local emergency number.
Stay with the person until help arrives.
Remove any guns, knives, medications, or other things that may cause harm.
Listen, but don�t judge, argue, threaten, or yell.
Get help from a crisis or suicide prevention hotline. Try the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255.

delusion,delusion causes,"Each case of psychosis is different, and the exact cause isn�t always clear. There are certain illnesses that cause psychosis. There are also triggers like drug use, lack of sleep, and other environmental factors. In addition, certain situations can lead to specific types of psychosis developing.
In general, some of the factors involved in psychosis are:
genetics
trauma (such as a death, sexual assault, or living through a war)
substance use (drugs like LSD and amphetamines have been linked
to instances of psychosis in some people)
mental health conditions (like schizophrenia)"
delusion,delusion risks,"It�s not currently possible to precisely identify who is likely to develop psychosis. However, research has shown that genetics may play a role.
People are more likely to develop a psychotic disorder if they have a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, who has a psychotic disorder.
Children born with the genetic mutation known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are at risk of developing a psychotic disorder, especially schizophrenia."
delusion,delusion diagnosis,"Psychosis is diagnosed through a psychiatric evaluation. That means a doctor will watch the person�s behavior and ask questions about what they�re experiencing.
Medical tests and X-rays may be used to determine whether there is an underlying illness causing the symptoms.
Diagnosing psychosis in children and teenagers
Many of the symptoms of psychosis in adults aren�t symptoms of psychosis in young people. For example, small children often have imaginary friends with whom they talk. This just represents imaginative play, which is completely normal for children.
But if you�re worried about psychosis in a child or adolescent, it�s best to describe their behavior to a doctor."
delusion,delusion treatment,"Treating psychosis may involve a combination of medications and therapy. Most people will experience an improvement in their symptoms with treatment.
Rapid tranquilization
Sometimes people experiencing psychosis can become agitated and be at risk of hurting themselves or others. In these cases, it may be necessary to calm them down quickly.
This method is called rapid tranquilization
. A doctor or emergency response personnel will administer a fast-acting injection or liquid medication to quickly relax the person.
Medication
Symptoms of psychosis can be managed with medications called antipsychotics. They reduce hallucinations and delusions, and help people think more clearly. The type of antipsychotic a doctor prescribes will depend on the symptoms.
In many cases, people only need to take antipsychotics for a short time until their symptoms are more manageable. Others may need to take them more long term.
Cognitive behavioral therapy
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of mental health therapy. Its goal is to change thinking and behaviors. CBT involves regular meetings with a mental health counselor.
CBT has been shown to be effective in helping people better manage their mental health conditions.
It�s often most helpful for symptoms of psychosis that medications don�t fully address."
delusion,delusion complications,"Psychosis doesn�t have many medical complications. However, if left untreated, it can be challenging for people experiencing psychosis to maintain quality of life. This could cause other conditions to go untreated.
Most people who experience psychosis, even severe cases, will recover with the proper treatment, such as therapy and medication."
coronary artery disease,coronary artery disease definition,"Coronary artery disease is the most common form of heart disease. It happens when something, like plaque buildup, reduces blood flow to the heart. It can increase your risk of heart attack.
Coronary artery disease (CAD) causes impaired blood flow in the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Also called coronary heart disease (CHD), CAD is the most common form of heart disease and affects approximately 16.5 million
Americans over the age of 20.
It�s also the leading ca
use of death
for both men and women in the United States. It�s estimated that every 36 seconds
, someone in the United States has a heart attack.
A heart attack can come from uncontrolled CAD."
coronary artery disease,coronary artery disease symptoms,"When your heart doesn�t get enough arterial blood, you may experience a variety of symptoms. Angina (chest discomfort) is the most common symptom of CAD. Some people describe this discomfort as:
chest pain
heaviness
tightness
burning
squeezing
These symptoms can also be mistaken for heartburn or indigestion.
Other symptoms of CAD include:
pain in the arms or shoulders
shortness of breath
sweating
dizziness
You may experience more symptoms when your blood flow is more restricted. If a blockage cuts off blood flow completely or almost completely, your heart muscle will start to die if not restored. This is a heart attack.
Don�t ignore any of these symptoms, especially if they are excruciating or last longer than five minutes. Immediate medical treatment is necessary.
Symptoms of CAD for women
Women may also experience the above symptoms, but they�re also more likely to have:
nausea
vomiting
back pain
jaw pain
shortness of breath without feeling chest pain
Men have a higher risk
of developing heart disease than women, however.
Due to decreased blood flow, your heart may also:
become weak
develop abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmia) or rates
fail to pump as much blood as your body needs
Your doctor will detect these heart abnormalities during diagnosis."
coronary artery disease,coronary artery disease causes,"The most common cause of CAD is a vascular injury with cholesterol plaque buildup in the arteries, known as atherosclerosis. Reduced blood flow occurs when one or more of these arteries becomes partially or completely blocked.
Other rare causes of damage or blockage to a coronary artery also limit blood flow to the heart."
coronary artery disease,coronary artery disease risks,"Understanding the risk factors for CAD can help with your plan to prevent or decrease the likelihood of developing the disease.
Risk factors include:
high blood pressure
high blood cholesterol levels
tobacco smoking
insulin resistance/hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus
obesity
inactivity
unhealthy eating habits
obstructive sleep apnea
emotional stress
excessive alcohol consumption
history of preeclampsia during pregnancy
The risk for CAD also increases with age. Based on age alone as a risk factor, men have a greater risk for the disease beginning at age 45 and women have a greater risk beginning at age 55. The risk for coronary artery disease is also higher if you have a family history of the disease."
coronary artery disease,coronary artery disease diagnosis,"Diagnosing CAD requires a review of your medical history, a physical examination, and other medical testing. These tests include:
Electrocardiogram: This test monitors electrical signals that travel through your heart. It may help your doctor determine whether you�ve had a heart attack.
Echocardiogram: This imaging test uses ultrasound waves to create a picture of your heart. The results of this test reveal whether certain things in your heart are functioning properly.
Stress test: This particular test measures the stress on your heart during physical activity and while at rest. The test monitors your heart�s electrical activity while you walk on a treadmill or ride a stationary bike. Nuclear imaging or echocardiographic imaging may also be performed for a portion of this test. For those unable to perform physical exercise, certain medications can be used instead for stress testing.
Cardiac catheterization (left heart catheterization): During this procedure, your doctor injects a special dye into your coronary arteries through a catheter inserted through an artery in your groin or wrist. The dye helps enhance the radiographic image of your coronary arteries to identify any blockages.
Heart CT scan: Your doctor may use this imaging test to check for calcium deposits in your arteries."
coronary artery disease,coronary artery disease treatment,"It�s important to reduce or control your risk factors and seek treatment to lower the chance of a heart attack or stroke if you�re diagnosed with CAD.
Treatment also depends on your current health condition, risk factors, and overall wellbeing. For example, your doctor may prescribe medication therapy to treat high cholesterol or high blood pressure, or you may receive medication to control blood sugar if you have diabetes.
Medications are the most common treatment for CAD. Learn more here.
Lifestyle changes can also reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke. For example:
quit smoking tobacco
reduce or stop your consumption of alcohol
exercise regularly
lose weight to a healthy level
eat a healthy diet (low in saturated fat, sodium, and added sugar)
If your condition doesn�t improve with lifestyle changes and medication, your doctor may recommend a procedure to increase blood flow to your heart. These procedures may be:
balloon angioplasty: to widen blocked arteries and smoosh down the plaque buildup, usually performed with insertion of a stent to help keep the lumen open after the procedure
coronary artery bypass graft surgery: to restore blood flow to the heart in open chest surgery
enhanced external counterpulsation: to stimulate the formation of new small blood vessels to naturally bypass clogged arteries in a noninvasive procedure"
congestive heart failure,congestive heart failure definition,"Heart failure occurs when your heart cannot pump enough blood to support your body functions. Seek help immediately if you�re experiencing symptoms such as heart palpitations, shortness of breath, or swelling.
Heart failure is characterized by the heart�s inability to pump an adequate supply of blood to the body. Without sufficient blood flow, all major body functions are disrupted. Heart failure is a condition or a collection of symptoms that weaken or stiffen your heart.
In some people with heart failure, the heart has difficulty pumping enough blood to support other organs in the body. Other people may have a hardening and stiffening of the heart muscle itself, which blocks or reduces blood flow to the heart.
Heart failure can affect the right or left side of your heart or both at the same time. It can be either an acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing) condition.
About 6.2 million Americans
have heart failure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Most cases are diagnosed in men. However, women are more likely to die from heart failure when the condition goes untreated.
Heart failure is a serious medical condition that requires treatment. Early treatment increases your chances of long-term recovery with fewer complications. Call your doctor right away if you�re having any symptoms of heart failure."
congestive heart failure,congestive heart failure causes,"Heart failure is most often related to another condition. The most common cause of heart failure is coronary artery disease (CAD), a disorder that causes narrowing of the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart. Other conditions that may increase your risk of developing heart failure include:
cardiomyopathy, a disorder of the heart muscle that causes the heart to become weak
congenital heart disease
heart attack
heart valve disease
certain types of arrhythmias, or irregular heart rhythms
high blood pressure
emphysema, a disease of the lung
untreated sleep apnea
diabetes
an overactive or underactive thyroid
HIV
severe forms of anemia
certain cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy
substance misuse disorder"
congestive heart failure,congestive heart failure symptoms,"The symptoms of heart failure may include:
fatigue
sudden weight gain
a loss of appetite
persistent coughing
irregular heart rate
heart palpitations
abdominal swelling
shortness of breath
exercise intolerance
leg and ankle swelling or abdomen
sleeping on extra pillows
getting short of breath while lying down
protruding neck veins"
congestive heart failure,congestive heart failure risks,"Heart failure can happen to anyone. However, certain factors may increase your risk of developing this condition.
There is a higher incidence of heart failure in men compared with women, though the prevalence is about the same for all sexes.
People with diseases that damage the heart are also at an increased risk. These conditions include:
hypertension
sleep apnea
diabetes
coronary artery disease
valve disease
anemia
hyperthyroidism
hypothyroidism
emphysema
Certain behaviors can also increase your risk of developing heart failure, including:
smoking
eating foods that are high in fat or cholesterol
not getting enough exercise
having overweight or obesity"
congestive heart failure,congestive heart failure diagnosis,"Physical exam
Your doctor may perform a physical exam to check for signs of heart failure. For instance, leg swelling, irregular heart rate, and bulging neck veins may lead your doctor to diagnose heart failure.
Echocardiogram
An echocardiogram is the most effective way to diagnose heart failure. It uses sound waves to create detailed pictures of your heart, which help your doctor evaluate the damage to your heart, the squeezing and relaxing function and determine the underlying causes of your condition.
Your doctor may use an echocardiogram along with other tests.
Other tests
chest X-ray This test can provide images of the heart and the surrounding organs.
heart MRI An MRI produces images of the heart without the use of radiation.
nuclear scan A very small dose of radioactive material is injected into your body to create images of the chambers of your heart.
catheterization or coronary angiogram In this type of X-ray exam, the doctor inserts a catheter into your blood vessel, usually in the groin or arm. They then guide it into the heart. This test can show how much blood is currently flowing through the heart.
stress exam During a stress exam, an EKG machine monitors your heart function while you run on a treadmill or perform another type of exercise.
Holter monitoring Electrode patches are placed on your chest and attached to a small machine called a Holter monitor for this test. The machine records the electrical activity of your heart for at least 24 to 48 hours.
BNP blood test A BNP test is done by drawing blood from a vein in your arm. This test can detect a rise in B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) hormone, which can be an indication of heart failure."
congestive heart failure,congestive heart failure prevention,"Some lifestyle measures can help treat heart failure and prevent the condition from developing. Maintaining a moderate weight and exercising regularly can significantly decrease your risk of heart failure. Reducing the amount of salt in your diet can also lower your risk.
Other habits that may prevent heart failure include:
limiting alcohol intake
not smoking
avoiding high fat foods
getting the right amount of sleep
staying active"
congestive heart failure,congestive heart failure complications,"Untreated heart failure can eventually lead to congestive heart failure (CHF), a condition in which blood builds up in other areas of your body. In this potential life threatening condition, you may experience fluid retention in your limbs as well as in your organs, such as the liver and lungs.
Additional complications of heart failure can include:
stroke
thromboembolism
arrhythmias, like atrial fibrillation
kidney dysfunction
Heart attack
A heart attack may also occur because of a complication related to heart failure.
Call 911 or your local emergency services right away if you have these symptoms:
crushing chest pain
discomfort in the chest, such as squeezing or tightness
discomfort in the upper body, including numbness or a coldness
fatigue
dizziness
rapid heart rate
vomiting
nausea
cold sweats"
stroke,stroke definition,"Recognizing stroke symptoms and seeking treatment quickly can lead to a better outcome. Symptoms can come on without warning and may include facial drooping, weakness or paralysis, and slurred speech."
stroke,stroke symptoms,"The loss of blood flow to the brain damages tissues within the brain. Symptoms of a stroke show up in the body parts controlled by the damaged areas of the brain.
The sooner a person having a stroke gets care, the better their outcome is likely to be. For this reason, it�s helpful to know the signs of a stroke so you can act quickly. Stroke symptoms can include:
paralysis
numbness or weakness in the arm, face, and leg, especially on one side of the body
trouble speaking or understanding others
slurred speech
confusion, disorientation, or lack of responsiveness
sudden behavioral changes, especially increased agitation
vision problems, such as trouble seeing in one or both eyes with vision blackened or blurred, or double vision
trouble walking
loss of balance or coordination
dizziness
severe, sudden headache with an unknown cause
seizures
nausea or vomiting
A stroke requires immediate medical attention. If you think you or someone else is having a stroke, call 911 or local emergency services right away. Prompt treatment is key to preventing the following outcomes:
brain damage
long-term disability
death
It�s better to be overly cautious when dealing with a stroke, so don�t be afraid to get emergency medical help if you think you recognize the signs of a stroke."
stroke,stroke causes,"The cause of a stroke depends on the type of stroke. Strokes fall into three main categories:
transient ischemic attack (TIA)
ischemic stroke
hemorrhagic stroke
Illustration by Bailey Mariner
These categories can be further broken down into other types of strokes, including:
embolic stroke
thrombotic stroke
intracerebral stroke
subarachnoid stroke
The type of stroke you have affects your treatment and recovery process.
Ischemic stroke
During an ischemic stroke, the arteries supplying blood to the brain narrow or become blocked. Blood clots or severely reduced blow flow to the brain causes these blockages. Pieces of plaque breaking off and blocking a blood vessel can also cause them.
There are two types of blockages
that can lead to ischemic stroke: a cerebral embolism and cerebral thrombosis.
A cerebral embolism (often referred to as embolic stroke) occurs when a blood clot forms in another part of the body � often the heart or arteries in the upper chest and neck � and moves through the bloodstream until it hits an artery too narrow to let it pass.
The clot gets stuck, and stops the flow of blood and causes a stroke.
Cerebral thrombosis (often referred to as thrombotic stoke) occurs when a blood clot develops at the fatty plaque within the blood vessel.
According to the CDC, 87 percent
of strokes are ischemic strokes.
Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
A transient ischemic attack, often called a TIA or ministroke, occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked temporarily.
Symptoms are similar to those of a full stroke. However, they�re typically temporary and disappear after a few minutes or hours, when the blockage moves and blood flow is restored.
A blood clot usually causes a TIA. While it�s not technically categorized as a full stroke, a TIA serves as a warning that an actual stroke may happen. Because of this, it�s best not to ignore it. Seek the same treatment you would for a major stroke and get emergency medical help.
According to the CDC
, more than one-third of people who experience a TIA and don�t get treatment have a major stroke within a year. Up to 10 to 15 percent of people who experience a TIA have a major stroke within 3 months.
Hemorrhagic stroke
A hemorrhagic stroke happens when an artery in the brain breaks open or leaks blood. The blood from that artery creates excess pressure in the skull and swells the brain, damaging brain cells and tissues.
The two types of hemorrhagic strokes are intracerebral and subarachnoid:
An intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke is the most common type of hemorrhagic stroke. It happens when the tissues surrounding the brain fill with blood after an artery bursts.
A subarachnoid hemorrhagic stroke is less common. It causes bleeding in the area between the brain and the tissues that cover it.
According to the American Heart Association, about 13 percent
of strokes are hemorrhagic."
stroke,stroke risks,"Certain risk factors make you more susceptible to stroke. According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
, risk factors for stroke include:
Diet
An unbalanced diet can increase the risk of stroke. This type of diet is high in:
salt
saturated fats
trans fats
cholesterol
Inactivity
Inactivity, or lack of exercise, can also raise the risk of stroke.
Regular exercise has a number of health benefits. The CDC recommends that adults get at least 2.5 hours
of aerobic exercise every week. This can mean simply a brisk walk a few times a week.
Heavy alcohol use
The risk of stroke also increases with heavy alcohol use.
If you drink, drink in moderation. This means no more than one drink a day for women, and no more than two drinks a day for men.
Heavy alcohol use can raise blood pressure levels. It can also raise triglyceride levels, which can cause atherosclerosis. This is plaque buildup in the arteries that narrows blood vessels.
Tobacco use
Using tobacco in any form also raises the risk of stroke, since it can damage the blood vessels and heart. Nicotine also raises blood pressure.
Personal background
There are some risk factors for stroke you can�t control, such as:
Family history. Stroke risk is higher in some families because of genetic health factors, such as high blood pressure.
Sex. According to the CDC
, while both women and men can have strokes, they�re more common in women than in men in all age groups.
Age. The older you are, the more likely you are to have a stroke.
Race and ethnicity. African Americans, Alaska Natives, and American Indians are more likely to have a stroke than other racial groups.
Health history
Certain medical conditions are linked to stroke risk. These include:
a previous stroke or TIA
high blood pressure
high cholesterol
carrying too much excess weight
heart disorders, such as coronary artery disease
heart valve defects
enlarged heart chambers and irregular heartbeats
sickle cell disease
diabetes
blood clotting disorder
patent foramen ovale (PFO)
To find out about your specific risk factors for stroke, talk with your doctor."
stroke,stroke complications,"The complications after stroke
can vary. They may occur because of either a direct injury to the brain during the stroke, or because abilities have been permanently affected.
Some of these complications include:
seizures
loss of bladder and bowel control
cognitive impairment, including dementia
reduced mobility, range of motion, or ability to control certain muscle movements
depression
mood or emotional changes
shoulder pain
bed sores
sensory or sensation changes
These complications can be managed by methods such as:
medication
physical therapy
counseling
Certain complications may even be reserved."
stroke,stroke prevention,"Lifestyle changes can�t prevent all strokes. But many of these changes can make a radical difference when it comes to lowering your risk of stroke.
These changes include the following:
Quit smoking. If you smoke, quitting now will lower your risk of stroke. You can reach out to your doctor to create a quit plan.
Limit alcohol use. Heavy alcohol consumption can raise your blood pressure, which in turn raises the risk of stroke. If reducing your intake is difficult, reach out to your doctor for help.
Keep a moderate weight. Overweight and obesity increases the risk of stroke. To help manage your weight, eat a balanced diet and stay physically active more often than not. Both steps can also reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
Get regular checkups. Talk with your doctor about how often to get a checkup for blood pressure, cholesterol, and any conditions you may have. They can also support you in making these lifestyle changes and offer guidance.
Taking all these measures will help put you in better shape to prevent stroke.
If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here."
stroke,stroke diagnosis,"Your doctor will ask you or a family member about your symptoms and what you were doing when they arose. They�ll take your medical history to find out your stroke risk factors. They�ll also:
ask what medications you take
check your blood pressure
listen to your heart
You�ll also have a physical exam, during which your doctor will evaluate you for:
balance
coordination
weakness
numbness in your arms, face, or legs
signs of confusion
vision issues
Your doctor will then do certain tests to help confirm a stroke diagnosis. These tests can help them determine whether you had a stroke and, if so:
what may have caused it
what part of the brain is affected
whether you have bleeding in the brain"
stroke,stroke diagnosis,"Your doctor may order various tests to further help them determine whether you�ve had a stroke, or to rule out another condition. These tests include:
Blood tests
Your doctor might draw blood for several blood tests. Blood tests can determine:
blood sugar levels
whether you have an infection
platelet counts
how fast your blood clots
cholesterol levels
MRI and CT scan
Your doctor may order may an MRI scan, CT scan, or both.
An MRI can help see whether any brain tissue or brain cells have been damaged.
A CT scan can provide a detailed and clear picture of your brain, which can show any bleeding or damage. It may also show other brain conditions that could be causing your symptoms.
EKG
An electrocardiogram (EKG) is a simple test that records the electrical activity in the heart, measuring its rhythm and recording how fast it beats.
An EKG can determine whether you have any heart conditions that may have led to a stroke, such as a prior heart attack or atrial fibrillation.
Cerebral angiogram
A cerebral angiogram offers a detailed look at the arteries in your neck and brain. The test can show blockages or clots that may have caused symptoms.
Carotid ultrasound
A carotid ultrasound, also called a carotid duplex scan, can show fatty deposits (plaque) in your carotid arteries, which supply the blood to your face, neck, and brain.
It can also show whether your carotid arteries have been narrowed or blocked.
Echocardiogram
An echocardiogram can find sources of clots in your heart. These clots may have traveled to your brain and caused a stroke."
stroke,stroke treatment,"Proper medical evaluation and prompt treatment are vital to recovering from a stroke. According to the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association, �Time lost is brain lost.�
Call 911 or local emergency services as soon as you realize you may be having a stroke, or if you suspect someone else is having a stroke.
Treatment for stroke depends on the type of stroke:
Ischemic stroke and TIA
Since a blood clot or blockage in the brain causes these stroke types, they�re largely treated with similar techniques. They can include:
Clot-breaking drugs
Thrombolytic drugs can break up blood clots in your brain�s arteries, which will stop the stroke and reduce damage to the brain.
One such drug, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), or Alteplase IV r-tPA, is considered the gold standard
in ischemic stroke treatment.
This drug works by dissolving blood clots quickly.
People who receive a tPA injection are more likely to recover from a stroke and less likely to have any lasting disability as a result of the stroke.
Mechanical thrombectomy
During this procedure, a doctor inserts a catheter into a large blood vessel inside your head. They then use a device to pull the clot out of the vessel. This surgery is most successful if it�s performed 6 to 24 hours
after the stroke begins.
Stents
If a doctor finds where artery walls have weakened, they may perform a procedure to inflate the narrowed artery and support the walls of the artery with a stent.
Surgery
In the rare instances that other treatments don�t work, surgery can remove a blood clot and plaques from your arteries.
This surgery may be done with a catheter. If the clot is especially large, a surgeon may open an artery to remove the blockage.
Hemorrhagic stroke
Strokes caused by bleeds or leaks in the brain require different treatment strategies. Treatments for hemorrhagic stroke include:
Medications
Unlike with an ischemic stroke, if you�re having a hemorrhagic stroke, the treatment goal is to make your blood clot. Therefore, you may be given medication to counteract any blood thinners you take.
You may also be prescribed drugs that can:
reduce blood pressure
lower the pressure in your brain
prevent seizures
prevent blood vessel constriction
Coiling
During this procedure, your doctor guides a long tube to the area of hemorrhage or weakened blood vessel. They then install a coil-like device in the area where the artery wall is weak. This blocks blood flow to the area, reducing bleeding.
Clamping
During imaging tests, your doctor may discover an aneurysm that hasn�t started bleeding yet or has stopped.
To prevent additional bleeding, a surgeon may place a tiny clamp at the base of the aneurysm. This cuts off blood supply and prevents a possible broken blood vessel or new bleeding.
Surgery
If your doctor sees that an aneurysm has burst, they may do surgery to clip the aneurysm and prevent additional bleeding. Likewise, a craniotomy may be needed to relieve the pressure on the brain after a large stroke.
In addition to emergency treatment, your healthcare team will advise you on ways to prevent future strokes."
high cholesterol,high cholesterol definition,"Causes of high cholesterol include diet, smoking, and genetics. High cholesterol rarely causes symptoms, so it�s important to have routine cholesterol screenings if you�re at risk.
High cholesterol is a pretty common issue in the U.S. In fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
, nearly 94 million U.S. adults ages 20 or older have what could be considered borderline high cholesterol.
However, because this condition can often present without any real symptoms, you may not even know you have it until you visit your doctor.
If you�re wondering what causes high cholesterol, what to do if you�ve been diagnosed with it, and if there are ways to reverse it (hint: there are), read on for all the answers."
high cholesterol,high cholesterol symptoms,"In most cases, high cholesterol is a �silent� condition. It typically doesn�t cause any symptoms. Many people don�t even realize they have high cholesterol until they develop serious complications, such as a heart attack or stroke.
That�s why routine cholesterol screening is important. If you�re 20 years or older, ask your doctor if you should have routine cholesterol screening. Learn how this screening could potentially save your life."
high cholesterol,high cholesterol causes,"Eating too many foods that are high in cholesterol, saturated fats, and trans fats may increase your risk of developing high cholesterol. Living with obesity can also increase your risk. Other lifestyle factors that can contribute to high cholesterol include inactivity and smoking.
Your genetics can also affect your chances of developing high cholesterol. Genes are passed down from parents to children. Certain genes instruct your body on how to process cholesterol and fats. If your parents have high cholesterol, you may be at a greater risk of having it too.
In rare cases, high cholesterol is caused by familial hypercholesterolemia. This genetic disorder prevents your body from removing LDL. According to the National Human Genome Research Institute
, most adults with this condition have total cholesterol levels above 300 milligrams per deciliter and LDL levels above 200 milligrams per deciliter.
Other health conditions, such as diabetes and hypothyroidism, may also increase your risk of developing high cholesterol and related complications."
high cholesterol,high cholesterol risks,"You may be at a higher risk of developing high cholesterol if you:
are living with obesity
consume a lot of saturated and trans fats, like those found in fast food
have limited physical activity
smoke tobacco products
have a family history of high cholesterol
have diabetes, kidney disease, or hypothyroidism
People of all ages, genders, and ethnicities can have high cholesterol."
high cholesterol,high cholesterol complications,"Without treatment, high cholesterol can cause plaque to build up in your arteries. Over time, this plaque can narrow your arteries. This condition is known as atherosclerosis.
Atherosclerosis is a serious condition. It can limit the flow of blood through your arteries. It also raises your risk of developing dangerous blood clots.
Atherosclerosis can result in many life threatening complications, such as:
stroke
heart attack
angina, or chest pain
high blood pressure
peripheral vascular disease
chronic kidney disease
High cholesterol can also create a bile imbalance, raising your risk of gallstones. See the other ways that high cholesterol can impact your body."
high cholesterol,high cholesterol prevention,"You can�t control the genetic risk factors for high cholesterol. However, lifestyle factors can be managed.
To lower your risk of developing high cholesterol:
Eat a nutritious diet that�s low in cholesterol and animal fats, and high in fiber.
Avoid excessive alcohol consumption.
Maintain a moderate weight.
E.xercise regularly.
Avoid smoking.
Follow your doctor�s recommendations for routine cholesterol screening. If you�re at risk of high cholesterol or coronary heart disease, they will likely encourage you to get your cholesterol levels tested on a regular basis."
infectious disease,infectious disease definition,"What is acute respiratory infection?
Acute respiratory infection is an infection that may interfere with normal breathing. It can affect just your upper respiratory system, which starts at your sinuses and ends at your vocal chords, or just your lower respiratory system, which starts at your vocal chords and ends at your lungs.
This infection is particularly dangerous for children, older adults, and people with immune system disorders."
infectious disease,infectious disease symptoms,"The symptoms you experience will be different if it�s a lower or upper respiratory infection. Symptoms can include:
congestion, either in the nasal sinuses or lungs
runny nose
cough
sore throat
body aches
fatigue
Call your doctor if you experience:
a fever over 103�F (39�C) and chills
difficulty breathing
dizziness
loss of consciousness"
infectious disease,infectious disease causes,"There are several different causes of acute respiratory infection.
Causes of upper respiratory infection:
acute pharyngitis
acute ear infection
common cold
Causes of lower respiratory infection:
bronchitis
pneumonia
bronchiolitis"
infectious disease,infectious disease risks,"It�s almost impossible to avoid viruses and bacteria, but certain risk factors increase your chances of developing acute respiratory infection.
The immune systems of children and older adults are more prone to being affected by viruses.
Children are especially at risk because of their constant contact with other kids who could be virus carriers. Children often don�t wash their hands regularly. They are also more likely to rub their eyes and put their fingers in their mouths, resulting in the spread of viruses.
People with heart disease or other lung problems are more likely to contract an acute respiratory infection. Anyone whose immune system might be weakened by another disease is at risk. Smokers also are at high risk and have more trouble recovering."
infectious disease,infectious disease diagnosis,"In a respiratory exam, the doctor focuses on your breathing. They will check for fluid and inflammation in the lungs by listening for abnormal sounds in your lungs when you breathe. The doctor may peer into your nose and ears, and check your throat.
If your doctor believes the infection is in the lower respiratory tract, an X-ray or CT scan may be necessary to check the condition of the lungs.
Lung function tests have been useful as diagnostic tools. Pulse oximetry, also known as pulse ox, can check how much oxygen gets into the lungs. A doctor may also take a swab from your nose or mouth, or ask you to cough up a sample of sputum (material coughed up from the lungs) to check for the type of virus or bacteria causing the disease."
infectious disease,infectious disease complications,"Complications of acute respiratory infection are extremely serious and can result in permanent damage and even death. They include:
respiratory arrest, which occurs when the lungs stop functioning
respiratory failure, a rise in CO2 in your blood caused by your lungs not functioning correctly
congestive heart failure"
infectious disease,infectious disease prevention,"Most causes of an acute respiratory infection aren�t treatable. Therefore, prevention is the best method to ward off harmful respiratory infections.
Getting the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) and pertussis vaccine will substantially lower your risk of getting a respiratory infection. You may also benefit from influenza vaccination and pneumovax. Talk to your doctor about getting these.
Practice good hygiene:
Wash your hands frequently, especially after you�ve been in a public place.
Always sneeze into the arm of your shirt or in a tissue. Although this may not ease your own symptoms, it will prevent you from spreading infectious diseases.
Avoid touching your face, especially your eyes and mouth, to prevent introducing germs into your system.
Was this helpful?
You should also avoid smoking and make sure you include plenty of vitamins in your diet, such as vitamin C, which helps boost your immune system. Vitamin C is maintained in immune cells, and a deficiency has been linked to higher susceptibility to infection. While research is unclear if Vitamin C can prevent an acute respiratory infection, there is evidence that it can shorten the length of time and or severity of some infections."
COPD,COPD definition,COPD is a disease that damages your lungs over time. It may start with mild symptoms and then get worse. Treatment can help symptoms and slow disease progression.
COPD,COPD symptoms,"COPD makes it harder to breathe. Symptoms may be mild at first, beginning with intermittent coughing and shortness of breath. As it progresses, symptoms can become more constant to where it can become increasingly difficult to breathe.
You may experience wheezing and tightness in the chest or have excess sputum production. Some people with COPD have acute exacerbations, which are flare-ups of severe symptoms.
Early symptoms
At first, symptoms of COPD can be quite mild. You might mistake them for a cold.
Early symptoms include:
occasional shortness of breath, especially after exercise
mild but recurrent cough
needing to clear your throat often, especially first thing in the morning
You might start making subtle changes, such as avoiding stairs and skipping physical activities.
Worsening symptoms
Symptoms can get progressively worse and harder to ignore. As the lungs become more damaged, you may experience:
shortness of breath, after even mild forms of exercise like walking up a flight of stairs
wheezing, which is a type of higher-pitched noisy breathing, especially during exhalations
chest tightness
chronic cough, with or without mucus
need to clear mucus from your lungs every day
frequent colds, flu, or other respiratory infections
lack of energy
In later stages of COPD, symptoms may also include:
fatigue
swelling of the feet, ankles, or legs
weight loss
Symptoms are likely to be much worse if you currently smoke or are regularly exposed to secondhand smoke.
Learn more about the symptoms of COPD.
Emergency treatment
Immediate medical care is needed if:
you have bluish or gray fingernails or lips, as this indicates low oxygen levels in your blood
you have trouble catching your breath or can�t talk
you feel confused, muddled, or faint
your heart is racing
Was this helpful?"
COPD,COPD causes,"Most people with COPD are at least 40 years old and have at least some history of smoking. The longer and more tobacco products you smoke, the greater your risk of COPD is.
In addition to cigarette smoke, cigar smoke, pipe smoke, and secondhand smoke can cause COPD. Your risk of COPD is even greater if you have asthma and smoke.
Other causes
You can also develop COPD if you�re exposed to chemicals and fumes in the workplace. Long-term exposure to air pollution and inhaling dust can also cause COPD.
In developing countries, along with tobacco smoke, homes are often poorly ventilated, forcing families to breathe fumes from burning fuel used for cooking and heating.
There may be a genetic predisposition to developing COPD. Up to an estimated 5 percent
of people with COPD have a deficiency in a protein called alpha-1-antitrypsin.
This deficiency causes the lungs to deteriorate and also can affect the liver. There may be other associated genetic factors at play as well."
COPD,COPD diagnosis,"There�s no single test for COPD. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, a physical exam, and diagnostic test results.
When you visit the doctor, be sure to mention all of your symptoms. Tell your doctor if:
you�re a smoker or have smoked in the past
you�re exposed to lung irritants on the job
you�re exposed to a lot of secondhand smoke
you have a family history of COPD
you have asthma or other respiratory conditions
you take over-the-counter or prescription medications
Exam and tests
During the physical exam, your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen to your lungs as you breathe. Based on all this information, your doctor may order some of these tests to get a more complete picture:
Spirometry is a noninvasive test to assess lung function. During the test, you�ll take a deep breath and then blow into a tube connected to the spirometer.
Imaging tests, like a chest X-ray or CT scan. These images can provide a detailed look at your lungs, blood vessels, and heart.
An arterial blood gas test. This involves taking a blood sample from an artery to measure your blood oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other important levels.
These tests can help determine if you have COPD or a different condition, such as asthma, a restrictive lung disease, or heart failure.
Learn more about how COPD is diagnosed."
COPD,COPD treatment,"Treatment can ease symptoms, prevent complications, and generally slow disease progression. Your healthcare team may include a lung specialist (pulmonologist) and physical and respiratory therapists.
Oxygen therapy
If your blood oxygen level is too low, you can receive supplemental oxygen through a mask or nasal cannula to help you breathe better. A portable unit can make it easier to get around.
Surgery
Surgery is reserved for severe COPD or when other treatments have failed, which is more likely when you have a form of severe emphysema.
One type of surgery is called bullectomy. During this procedure, surgeons remove large, abnormal air spaces (bullae) from the lungs.
Another is lung volume reduction surgery, which removes damaged upper lung tissue. Lung volume reduction surgery can be effective at improving breathing, but few patients undergo this major, somewhat risky procedure.
Lung transplantation is an option in some cases. Lung transplantation can effectively cure COPD, but has its many risks.
There is a less invasive method of improving the efficiency of airflow in people with severe emphysema called endobronchial valves (EBV), which are one-way valves that divert inspired air to healthy lungs and away from non-functioning, damaged lungs.
In 2018, an EBV device called the Zephyr Endobronchial Valve
was approved by the FDA and has been shown to improve lung function, exercise capacity and quality of life for patients living with emphysema.
Lifestyle changes
Certain lifestyle changes may also help alleviate your symptoms or provide relief.
If you smoke, quit. Your doctor can recommend appropriate products or support services.
Whenever possible, avoid secondhand smoke and chemical fumes.
Get the nutrition your body needs. Work with your doctor or dietician to create a healthy eating plan.
Talk to your doctor about how much exercise is safe for you.
Learn more about the different treatment options for COPD."
kidney failure,kidney failure definition,"Kidney failure occurs when your kidneys lose the ability to filter waste from your blood sufficiently. It may not cause symptoms in the early stages.
Your kidneys filter your blood and remove toxins from your body. These toxins go to your bladder and are eliminated when you urinate. When this doesn�t work properly, you can get kidney failure.
If your kidneys aren�t able to function properly, toxins can overwhelm your body. This can lead to kidney failure, which can be life threatening if left untreated.
Keep reading as we break down everything you need to know about kidney failure, including symptoms, stages, treatment, and the typical outlook."
kidney failure,kidney failure symptoms,"Early-stage kidney failure often doesn�t cause noticeable symptoms. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
, about 90% of people with chronic kidney disease don�t know they have it.
As kidney disease progresses, symptoms may include:
reduced amount of urine
swelling of your legs, ankles, and feet from fluid retention
shortness of breath
trouble sleeping
muscle cramping at night
excessive drowsiness or fatigue
persistent nausea
confusion
chest pain or pressure
seizures
coma
Early signs of kidney failure
Symptoms of early-stage kidney disease may be subtle and hard to identify. They may include:
decreased urine output
swelling in limbs
shortness of breath
Kidney failure urine color
The color of your urine doesn�t tell you much about the state of your kidney function until damage to the kidneys has progressed.
Still, urine color changes may be an early indicator of some issues.
Urine color Indication
clear or pale yellow well-hydrated
dark yellow or amber dehydrated
orange dehydration or bile in the bloodstream
pink or red blood in the urine or having eaten certain foods, like beets
foamy contains a lot of protein; potentially an indicator of kidney disease"
kidney failure,kidney failure causes,"Kidney failure can result from various causes. According to the National Kidney Foundation, the two most common include high blood pressure and diabetes.
People who are most at risk usually have one or more of the following:
Loss of blood flow to the kidneys
A sudden loss of blood flow to your kidneys can prompt kidney failure. Some causes include:
heart attack
heart disease
scarring of the liver or liver failure
dehydration
severe burns
allergic reactions
severe infection, such as sepsis
High blood pressure and anti-inflammatory medications can also limit blood flow.
Urine elimination problems
When your body can�t eliminate urine, toxins build up and overload the kidneys. Some cancers can block the urine passageways, such as:
prostate
colon
cervical
bladder
Other conditions can interfere with urination and possibly lead to kidney failure, including:
kidney stones
enlarged prostate
blood clots within your urinary tract
damage to the nerves that control your bladder
Other causes
Other factors that may lead to kidney failure include:
a blood clot in or around your kidneys
heavy metal poisoning
drugs and alcohol use
vasculitis, an inflammation of the blood vessels
lupus, an autoimmune disease that can cause inflammation of many body organs
glomerulonephritis, an inflammation of the small blood vessels of the kidneys
hemolytic uremic syndrome, which involves the breakdown of red blood cells following a bacterial infection, usually of the intestines
multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cells in your bone marrow
scleroderma, an autoimmune condition that affects your skin
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a disorder that causes blood clots in small vessels
chemotherapy drugs that treat cancer and some autoimmune diseases
dyes used in some imaging tests
certain antibiotics
unmanaged diabetes"
kidney failure,kidney failure diagnosis,"Doctors use several tests to diagnose kidney failure. Common tests include:
Urinalysis: A urine sample can show how much protein or sugar is in your urine. A urinary sediment examination looks for red and white blood cells, high levels of bacteria, and high numbers of cellular casts.
Urine volume measurements: Measuring urine output can help diagnose kidney failure. Low output may suggest that kidney disease is due to a urinary blockage.
Blood samples: Blood tests can measure substances filtered by your kidneys, such as blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. A rapid rise in these levels may indicate acute kidney failure.
Imaging: Tests like ultrasounds, MRIs, and CT scans provide images of your kidneys and urinary tract to identify issues.
Kidney tissue sample: Doctors use a kidney biopsy to collect and examine tissue samples."
kidney failure,kidney failure treatment,"The type of treatment you need depends on the cause and stage of your kidney failure.
Dialysis
Dialysis filters and purifies the blood using a machine to performs the function of the kidneys. Depending on the type of dialysis, you may be connected to a large machine or a portable catheter bag.
Along with dialysis, you may need to follow a low potassium, low salt diet.
Dialysis doesn�t cure kidney failure, but going to regularly scheduled treatments can extend your life.
Kidney transplant
A transplanted kidney can work fully, so you no longer need dialysis.
There�s usually a long wait to receive a donor kidney that�s compatible with your body. If you have a living donor, the process may go more quickly.
Transplant surgery might not be the right treatment option for everyone. It is not always successful.
You must take immunosuppressant drugs after the surgery to prevent your body from rejecting the new kidney. These drugs have their own side effects, some of which can be serious.
You can talk with a doctor about whether you�re a good candidate for a kidney transplant.
Lifestyle modifications
Minimizing your intake of alcohol and making dietary changes may help prevent kidney failure from progressing.
At the early stages and beyond, it�s possible to manage and slow progression with lifestyle factors such as:
Dietary changes
The guidelines for what you eat will often depend on the stage of kidney disease you have and your overall health. Some recommendations might include:
Limiting sodium and potassium: Aim to eat less than 2,000 milligrams per day of both sodium (salt) and potassium.
Limiting phosphorus: Try to stay below 1,000 milligrams
of phosphorus.
Following protein guidelines: In early and moderate kidney disease, you might want to cut back on protein consumption. But you may eat more protein in end-stage kidney failure, depending on your doctor�s recommendations.
Beyond these general guidelines, a doctor may also ask you to avoid certain foods.
Lowering alcohol intake
If you have kidney failure and drink alcohol, your kidneys must work harder than they already do. Alcohol doesn�t metabolize out of your system, so if you have complete kidney failure, you�ll feel its effects until you receive dialysis to filter it from your blood.
Beer, ale, and wine also contain large amounts of phosphorous. Severe heart issues and death are possible if your kidneys cannot filter it out.
If you have kidney failure or late-stage kidney disease, a doctor may recommend you limit alcohol. Eliminating alcohol from your diet, if possible, may be best."
kidney failure,kidney failure complications,"Kidney failure can lead to various complications. These can include:
anemia
bone weakness, due to an imbalance of phosphorus and calcium
fluid retention (edema)
heart disease
high potassium levels (hyperkalemia)
metabolic acidosis, when the blood becomes too acidic
Many people with kidney failure develop secondary complications. These can include:
depression
liver failure
fluid buildup in the lungs
gout
nerve damage
skin infections"
kidney failure,kidney failure prevention,"You can take steps to lower the risk of kidney failure.
Follow directions when taking over-the-counter medications. Taking doses that are too high, even of common drugs like aspirin, can create high toxin levels quickly. This can overload your kidneys.
Many kidney or urinary tract conditions lead to kidney failure without prompt treatment.
You can help lower your risk of kidney failure by:
eating a balanced diet
maintaining a moderate weight
taking prescribed and over-the-counter medications as directed and not taking more medication than is safe
keeping conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, well managed and following a doctor�s advice"
dementia,dementia definition,"Dementia is a neurodegenerative disease that has several different forms, symptoms, and causes. There�s currently no cure, but researchers are looking into effective treatments and ways to prevent it.
Dementia is a decline in cognitive function. To be considered dementia, mental impairment must affect at least two brain functions. Dementia may affect:
Dementia may be caused by a variety of illnesses or injuries. Mental impairment may range from mild to severe. It may also cause personality changes.
Some types of dementia are progressive. This means they get worse over time. Some types are treatable or even reversible. Some experts restrict the term �dementia� to irreversible mental deterioration."
dementia,dementia symptoms,"In its early stages, dementia can cause symptoms, such as:
Not coping well with change. Someone may have a hard time accepting changes in schedules or environment.
Subtle changes in short-term memory making. Someone can remember the events of 15 years ago like it was yesterday, but they can�t remember what they had for lunch.
Reaching for the right words. Word recollection or association may be more difficult.
Being repetitive. Someone may ask the same question, complete the same task, or tell the same story multiple times.
Confused sense of direction. Places someone once knew well may now feel foreign. They may also struggle with driving routes they�ve taken for years because it no longer looks familiar.
Struggling to follow storylines. Someone may find following a person�s story or description difficult.
Changes in mood. Depression, frustration, and anger are not uncommon for people with dementia.
Loss of interest. Apathy may occur in people with dementia. This includes losing interest in hobbies or activities that they once enjoyed.
Confusion. People, places, and events may no longer feel familiar. Someone might not remember people who know them.
Difficulty completing everyday tasks. A person in the early stages of dementia may have trouble recalling how to do tasks they�ve done for many years."
dementia,dementia causes,"Dementia has many causes. In general, it results from the degeneration of neurons (brain cells) or disturbances in other body systems that affect how neurons function.
Several conditions can cause dementia, including diseases of the brain. The most common causes are Alzheimer�s disease and vascular dementia.
Some of the more common causes of dementia include:
Neurodegenerative diseases
�Neurodegenerative� means that neurons gradually stop functioning or function inappropriately and eventually die.
This affects the neuron-to-neuron connections, called synapses, which arehow messages are passed along in your brain. This disconnect can result in a range of dysfunction.
Alzheimer�s disease
Parkinson�s disease with dementia
vascular dementia
chronic alcohol use disorder
Another cause is frontotemporal lobar degeneration. This is a blanket term for a range of conditions that cause damage to the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. They include:
frontotemporal dementia
Pick�s disease
supranuclear palsy
corticobasal degeneration
Other causes of dementia
Dementia has other causes, including:
structural brain disorders, such as normal pressure hydrocephalus and subdural hematoma
metabolic disorders, such as hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 deficiency, and kidney and liver disorders
toxins, such as lead
certain tumors or infections of the brain
medication side effects
Some of these types of dementia may be reversible. These treatable causes of dementia may reverse symptoms if they�re caught early enough. This is one of the many reasons why it�s important to contact your doctor and get a medical workup as soon as symptoms develop."
dementia,dementia treatment,"Two primary treatments are used to alleviate symptoms of dementia: medications and non-drug therapies. Not all medications are approved for each type of dementia, and no treatment is a cure.
Medications for dementia
Two main types of medication are used to treat symptoms of Alzheimer�s disease and other dementia-causing conditions:
Cholinesterase inhibitors. These drugs increase a chemical called acetylcholine. This chemical may help form memories and improve judgment. It may also delay worsening symptoms of Alzheimer�s disease.
Memantine. This drug is used to delay the onset of cognitive and behavioral symptoms in people with moderate or severe Alzheimer�s disease. Memantine may let people with Alzheimer�s disease maintain their usual mental functions for a longer period of time.
These two drugs may also be prescribed together. Side effects can occur. Other medications may be prescribed to treat related symptoms, such as impaired sleep, mood changes, and more.
Aducanumab (Aduhelm)
Aducanumab is another medication approved to treat Alzheimer�s and may slow the progression of the disease, though research is ongoing. Aducanumab is an anti-amyloid antibody therapy delivered intravenously. It targets a specific protein fragment that can disrupt communication between nerve cells in the brain.
Non-drug therapies
These therapies may help reduce symptoms of dementia and alleviate some of the manageable complications of the condition. Common non-drug treatments for dementia include:
Modifying your environment. Clutter, noise, and overstimulation may reduce focus.
Modifying common tasks. You can work with a therapist or other healthcare professional to break down everyday activities, such as showering or grooming, into manageable tasks.
Occupational therapy. Occupational therapists are specialized healthcare professionals who can help you learn to be safer and more secure with tasks including walking, cooking, and driving."
dementia,dementia prevention,"For decades, doctors and researchers believed dementia could not be prevented or cured. However, new research suggests that may not be the case.
A 2017 review found that more than one-third of dementia cases may be the result of lifestyle factors. Specifically, the researchers identified nine risk factors that may increase a person�s chance of developing dementia. They include:
midlife hypertension
midlife obesity
hearing loss
late-life depression
diabetes
physical inactivity
smoking
social isolation
lower levels of education
The researchers believe that targeting these risk factors with treatment or intervention could delay or possibly prevent some cases of dementia.
A 2019 retrospective study
looked at nearly 200,000 participants of European ancestry. The study suggested that lifestyle factors such as smoking status, physical activity, diet, and alcohol consumption could potentially contribute to the risk of dementia.
These findings suggest that working with your doctor to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle could help prevent or delay the onset of dementia."
osteoarthritis,osteoarthritis definition,"Arthritis is an inflammation of the joints that may affect one joint or multiple joints. The symptoms of arthritis usually develop over time, but they may also appear suddenly.
There are more than
100 different types of arthritis, with different causes and treatment methods.
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis
in the United States. Other common types
include:
The typical age for developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is between ages 30 and 50. It can, however, affect children, teens, and younger adults.
Osteoarthritis (OA) commonly develops after the age 50 or 60 years, but there are studies that reveal radiographic evidence of OA occurring in women in their 40s. It also tends to be more prevalent in individuals who are overweight.
Join others who understand what you�re going through, and discover a safe space for community, guidance, and support to manage PsA symptoms together."
osteoarthritis,osteoarthritis symptoms,"Joint pain, stiffness, and swelling are the most common symptoms
of arthritis. Your symptoms may also feel worse in the morning when you get out of bed or upon standing up after you�ve been resting.
Other symptoms of osteoarthritis include:
limited range of motion that sometimes goes away after movement
clicking or popping with bending
muscle weakness around the joint
instability or buckling of the joint
bony growths in the fingers
grating or scraping feeling in the knees
Other symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis include:
morning stiffness that can last 30 minutes or more
more than one affected joint
onset in smaller joints like feet and hands
same joints on both sides of the body are affected
fatigue
low-grade fever
inflammation of the eyes and mouth
inflammation of the heart muscle and blood vessels
low red blood cell count"
osteoarthritis,osteoarthritis causes,"Arthritis may be caused by
:
wear and tear of a joint from overuse
age (OA is most common in adults over age 50)
injuries
obesity
autoimmune disorders
genes or family history
muscle weakness
Osteoarthritis
Normal wear and tear causes OA, one of the most common forms of arthritis. An infection or injury to the joints can exacerbate this natural breakdown of cartilage tissue.
Cartilage is a firm but flexible connective tissue in your joints. It protects the joints by absorbing the pressure and shock created when you move and put stress on them. A reduction in the normal amount of this cartilage tissue causes some forms of arthritis.
Your risk of developing OA may
also be higher if you have a family history of the disease.
Rheumatoid arthritis
Another common form of arthritis, RA, is an autoimmune disorder. It occurs when your body�s immune system attacks the tissues of the body, resulting in inflammation to joints as well as other body organs.
In the joints, this inflammatory response affects the synovium, a soft tissue in your joints that produces a fluid that nourishes the cartilage and lubricates the joints, eventually destroying both bone and cartilage inside the joint.
The exact cause of the immune system�s attacks is unknown. But scientists have discovered genetic markers that increase your risk of developing RA fivefold."
osteoarthritis,osteoarthritis diagnosis,"Seeing your primary care physician is a good first step if you�re unsure who to see for an arthritis diagnosis. They will perform a physical exam to check for fluid around the joints, warm or red joints, and document the range of motion in the joints. Your doctor can refer you to a specialist if needed.
If you�re experiencing severe symptoms, you may choose to schedule an appointment with a rheumatologist first. This may lead to a faster diagnosis and treatment.
Documenting inflammation levels in your blood and aspirating and analyzing joint fluids, if present, can help your doctor determine what kind of arthritis you have.
Blood tests that check for specific types of antibodies like anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), rheumatoid factor (RF) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) are also common diagnostic tests.
Doctors commonly use imaging scans such as X-ray, MRI, and CT scans to produce an image of your bones and cartilage. This helps them rule out other causes of your symptoms, such as bone spurs.

osteoarthritis,osteoarthritis complications,"When left untreated, symptoms of arthritis may worsen and affect your day-to-day life. Below are some of the possible complications associated with this condition:
Reduced mobility. As arthritis progresses, you may experience less comfortable movement. This can interfere with your daily routine and may keep you from your favorite activities as well as socializing.
Possible weight gain. This is attributed to decreased movements, as well as discomfort that keeps you from exercising.
Increased risk of metabolic disorders. Being overweight with an inflammatory condition like arthritis may increase your chances of developing type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and heart disease.
Inflammation in other areas of your body. If your arthritis is attributed to an autoimmune disease like with RA, the inflammation can spread and affect your skin, eyes, blood vessels, and lungs.
Risk of falls. According to the Arthritis Foundation, people with OA are more likely to experience falls and possible fractures. This is primarily caused by related muscle weakness, but dizziness from pain medications can also lead to falls.
Decreased ability to work. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that about 60 percent
of people with arthritis are working age. Arthritis may affect your ability to move around in the workplace or even get from your mode of transportation to your job site.
Effects on mental health. Arthritis may increase the risk of anxiety and depression due to ongoing pain, inflammation, and social isolation.

osteoarthritis,osteoarthritis risks,"The overall risk factors for arthritis
include:
Obesity. Particularly associated with OA, being overweight puts added stress on weight-bearing joints in the body, such as your knees and hips. Losing excess weight can help reduce your risk of developing arthritis, and it may also help if you already have the condition.
Age and gender. The risk of developing arthritis increases with age. Also, women are more likely
than men to develop most forms of arthritis. The exception is gout, which is more prominent in men.
Overuse injuries. Repetitive stress injuries incurred during exercise, your job, or other activities may increase your risk of developing OA in the affected joint(s) later in life.
Your genes. A family history of autoimmune diseases as well as certain inherited genes may increase your risk of RA and other related types of arthritis.
Smoking. Your risk of developing RA may increase if you smoke
, and smoking can in turn make this autoimmune disease worse."
anxiety disorder,anxiety disorder definition,"Anxiety affects everyone in different ways. Sometimes, the feelings of fear and dread don�t go away or get worse over time. Here, you can learn about anxiety, who it affects, and how to manage it."
anxiety disorder,anxiety disorder symptoms,"Anxiety feels different depending on the person experiencing it. Feelings can range from butterflies in your stomach to a racing heart. You might feel out of control like there�s a disconnect between your mind and body.
You may have a general feeling of fear and worry, or you may fear a specific place or event. In some cases, you may experience a panic attack.
Symptoms
of anxiety can include:
anxious thoughts or beliefs that are difficult to control
restlessness
trouble concentrating
difficulty falling asleep
fatigue
irritability
unexplained aches and pains
Your anxiety symptoms might be different from someone else�s. That�s why it�s essential to know how anxiety can present itself. Read about the many types of anxiety symptoms you might experience."
anxiety disorder,anxiety disorder causes,"Experts aren�t sure of the exact cause of anxiety. But it�s likely that a combination of factors play a role.
The causes of anxiety may include:
stress
other medical issues such as depression or diabetes
first degree relatives with generalized anxiety disorder
environmental concerns, such as child abuse
substance use
situations such as surgery or occupational hazard
In addition, researchers believe that it stems from the areas of the brain responsible for controlling fear and the storing and retrieval of emotional and fear-related memories."
anxiety disorder,anxiety disorder risks,"With each type of anxiety, there are different risk factors. But there are some general influences
, including:
Personality traits. This includes shyness and nervousness in childhood.
Life history. This includes being exposed to negative or stressful live events.
Genetics. Of those who have a diagnosis of anxiety, 25 percent
have a first degree relative who also has a diagnosis of anxiety.
Other health conditions. Thyroid problems and other health conditions can make you prone to anxiety.
Stimulants. Consuming caffeine
, specific substances, and medications can worsen your symptoms."
anxiety disorder,anxiety disorder diagnosis,"A single test can�t diagnose anxiety. Instead, an anxiety diagnosis requires a lengthy process of physical examinations, mental health tests, and psychological questionnaires.
Some doctors or healthcare professionals may conduct a physical exam, including blood or urine tests to rule out underlying medical conditions that could contribute to the symptoms you�re experiencing.
Several anxiety tests and scales are also used to help a doctor assess the level of anxiety you�re experiencing. Reach about each of these tests."
anxiety disorder,anxiety disorder treatment,"Once you�ve received a diagnosis of anxiety, you can explore treatment options with a doctor.
But treatment can help you overcome the symptoms and lead a more manageable day-to-day life.
Treatment for anxiety falls into three categories:
Psychotherapy. Therapy can include cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure response prevention.
Complemental health techniques. Mindfulness, yoga, and self-management strategies such as stress management are ways to treat your anxiety using alternative methods.
Medication. Doctors prescribe antianxiety and antidepressant drugs.
Meeting with a therapist or psychologist can help you learn tools to use and strategies to cope with stress when it occurs.
The Mental Health Resources page can provide tips on finding a psychiatrist, or a doctor who specializes in mental health, to fit your needs.
Medications typically used to treat anxiety include benzodiazepines for short-term symptom relief, but they�re avoided if possible due to the high risk of dependence. Other antianxiety or antidepressant medications such as escitalopram effectively alter your brain chemistry to improve mood and reduce stress.
Some other commonly used medications include:
Selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Escitalopram, fluoxetine, and paroxetine are common SSRIs.
Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Duloxetine and venlafaxine are common SNRIs.
Antipsychotics. Quetiapine and aripiprazole are common antipsychotics.
Benzodiazepines. Diazepam and clonazepam are common benzodiazepines.
Anxiolytics. Buspirone is a common anxiolytic.

anxiety disorder,anxiety disorder prevention,"Children and teens
It�s not known why anxiety develops in children and teenagers. But there are excellent public health approaches that work to prevent the disorder, and they include:
suicide prevention
bullying prevention
youth violence prevention
child maltreatment prevention
mental health programs
As parents, you can communicate openly and honestly with your child while ensuring they�re making healthy decisions.
To learn more about how to support your child�s mental health, please check out the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) resource page
.
In addition, in cases of children and teens experiencing anxiety in response to something happening within their family or in their home, it�s a good idea to get family therapy. This is important especially because children and teens may not find it so easy to talk about their feelings or be aware of their anxiety.
Adults
There are many ways to prevent anxiety and its symptoms. Please see the below options:
Avoidance. Avoiding people, places, and situations can lessen your stress and anxiety. But this would be a short-term strategy. In the long term, it�s better if you get treatment so you no longer need to avoid a trigger.
Stress management and mindfulness. Practicing stress management and mindfulness prevents strain.
Restrict caffeine. Caffeine can worsen anxiety symptoms.
Support groups. Speaking with others is an opportunity to share coping strategies and experiences.
Therapy. Speaking with a therapist can help you develop more effective ways to cope with fears and stress that lead to anxiety.
Speak with a doctor about your medications. Regularly speaking with a doctor about your medications� dosing, effectiveness, and side effects ensures any health condition is treated adequately and monitored for any possible anxiety-related side effects."
sepsis,sepsis definition,"Sepsis is a life threatening illness caused by your body�s response to an infection. Your immune system protects you from many illnesses and infections, but it�s also possible for it to go into overdrive in response to an infection.
There are approximately 1.7 million cases of sepsis each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
. In addition, this type of infection kills nearly 270,000 people in the United States every year.
Keep reading to learn more about sepsis symptoms, treatment, and complications."
sepsis,sepsis symptoms,"It�s important to seek immediate medical attention if you have any symptoms of sepsis. The earlier you seek treatment, the greater chance you have of recovering.
Signs and symptoms of sepsis
Symptoms of sepsis can include:
fever and/or chills
confusion or disorientation
difficulty breathing
fast heart rate or low blood pressure (hypotension)
extreme pain
sweaty skin
It�s possible to mistake the symptoms above for those of another condition, like pneumonia, COVID-19, or cancer.
In addition, sepsis symptoms can be particularly hard to identify in infants, children, and people with:
communication challenges
learning disabilities
dementia
It�s best to seek medical assistance right away if you suspect sepsis. A health professional can examine you or the person you care for to make a diagnosis.
Signs and symptoms of severe sepsis
Severe sepsis is characterized by organ failure. You must have one or more of the following signs to be diagnosed with severe sepsis:
difficulty breathing
bluish discoloration of the skin, especially lips, fingers, toes
chills due to a drop in body temperature
decreased urination
dizziness
changes in mental ability
extreme weakness (asthenia)
low platelet count (thrombocytopenia)
abnormal heart functions
unconsciousness
Signs and symptoms of septic shock (septicemia)
Sepsis can advance very quickly to severe sepsis and septic shock. As it transitions, it becomes more life threatening.
Some severe sepsis and septic shock symptoms can overlap, like severe difficulty breathing, acute confusion, and bluish skin. Another key symptom of septic shock is very low blood pressure.
If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here."
sepsis,sepsis causes,"Any infection can trigger sepsis, but the following types of infections have a higher risk of causing sepsis:
pneumonia
abdominal infections
kidney infections
blood poisoning
According to the National Institute of General Medical Sciences
, the number of sepsis cases in the United States increases every year. Possible reasons for the increase include:
an aging population, due to the fact that sepsis is more common in seniors
an increase in antibiotic resistance, which happens when an antibiotic medication loses its ability to resist or kill bacteria
an increase in the number of people with illnesses that weaken their immune systems"
sepsis,sepsis risks,"Although some people have a higher risk of infection, anyone can get sepsis. People who are at the highest risk include:
young children and seniors
people with weaker immune systems, including people with HIV or those undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer
people in intensive care units (ICUs)
people exposed to invasive devices, like intravenous catheters or breathing tubes"
sepsis,sepsis diagnosis,"If you have sepsis symptoms, your doctor will order tests to diagnose and determine the severity of your infection. One of the first tests is a blood test. Your blood is checked for complications like:
infection
clotting problems
abnormal liver or kidney function
decreased amount of oxygen
an electrolyte imbalance, which affects the amount of water in your body and the acidity of your blood
Depending on your symptoms and the results of your blood test, your doctor may order other tests, including:
a urine test (to check for bacteria in your urine)
a wound secretion test (to check an open wound for an infection)
a mucus secretion test (to identify germs responsible for an infection)
If your doctor can�t determine the source of an infection using the above tests, they may order an internal view of your body using one of the following:
chest x-rays to view the lungs
CT scans to view possible infections in the appendix, pancreas, or bowel area
ultrasounds to view infections in the gallbladder or ovaries
MRI scans, which can identify soft tissue infections"
sepsis,sepsis prevention,"You can reduce your risk of sepsis by preventing the spread of infection. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, this is more important than ever.
Severe COVID-19 infections cause symptoms similar to sepsis. In addition, contracting COVID-19 puts you at an increased risk of developing another infection. A 2021 review
reported that up to 17 percent of people admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 had additional infections.
You can help prevent both COVID-19 and other infections by taking the following precautions:
Stay up to date on your vaccinations. Get vaccinated for COVID-19, the flu, pneumonia, and other common infections.
Keep your distance from people outside your household. Avoid non-essential travel and activities, and stay 6 feet away from people you don�t know.
Wear a mask. Masks help protect you and others from respiratory infections. Wear a mask in indoor public spaces, like grocery stores and movie theaters.
Practice good hygiene. This means practicing proper wound care, hand-washing, and bathing regularly.
Get immediate care if you develop signs of infection. Every minute counts when it comes to sepsis treatment. The sooner you get treatment, the better the outcome."
sepsis,sepsis complications,"Sepsis symptoms can range from mild to severe. Complications are more likely in severe cases. These complications can include:
blood clots
an increased risk of infection
tissue death (gangrene)
organ damage
organ failure, particularly the kidneys, heart, and lungs
Severe cases of sepsis can be fatal. A 2020 review
found that the mortality rate for sepsis after 90 days was 32.2 percent. The mortality rate for septic shock after 90 days was 38.5 percent."
rash,rash definition,"Many viral rashes clear up on their own as the infection clears, but some may require antiviral medication."
rash,rash treatment,"Viral infections often have to run their course. Unlike bacterial infections, they don�t respond to antibiotics, so treatment usually focuses on relieving symptoms.
You can try to speed up the healing process by drinking lots of fluids and allowing your body plenty of rest.
If you have a fever or body aches, you can take medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil). Parents should not give aspirin to children under age 3 without consulting a doctor.
If you have an itchy viral rash, you can try applying a cool compress or calamine lotion to the affected area. Try to avoid scratching it if you can.
For some viral infections, such as shingles, your doctor might prescribe an antiviral medication."
acute kidney injury,acute kidney injury definition,"What is acute kidney failure?
Acute kidney failure happens when your kidneys suddenly lose the ability to eliminate excess salts, fluids, and waste materials from the blood. This elimination is the core of your kidneys� main function. Body fluids can rise to dangerous levels when kidneys lose their filtering ability. The condition will also cause electrolytes and waste material to accumulate in your body, which can also be life-threatening.
Acute kidney failure is also called acute kidney injury or acute renal failure. It�s common in people who are already in the hospital. It may develop rapidly over a few hours. It can also develop over a few days to weeks. People who are critically ill and need intensive care have the highest risk of developing acute kidney failure.
Acute kidney failure can be life-threatening and requires intensive treatment. However, it may be reversible. If you�re in good health otherwise, recovery is possible."
acute kidney injury,acute kidney injury causes,"Acute kidney failure can occur for many reasons. Among the most common reasons are:
acute tubular necrosis (ATN)
severe or sudden dehydration
toxic kidney injury from poisons or certain medications
autoimmune kidney diseases, such as acute nephritic syndrome and interstitial nephritis
urinary tract obstruction
Reduced blood flow can damage your kidneys. The following conditions can lead to decreased blood flow to your kidneys:
low blood pressure
burns
dehydration
hemorrhage
injury
septic shock
serious illness
surgery
Certain disorders can cause clotting within your kidney�s blood vessels, and this can lead to acute kidney failure. These conditions include:
hemolytic uremic syndrome
idiopathic thrombocytopenic thrombotic purpura (ITTP)
malignant hypertension
transfusion reaction
scleroderma
Some infections, such as septicemia and acute pyelonephritis, can directly injure your kidneys.
Pregnancy can also cause complications that harm the kidneys, including placenta previa and placenta abruption."
acute kidney injury,acute kidney injury risks,"The chances of acquiring acute kidney failure are greater if you�re an older person or if you have any of the following long-term health problems:
kidney disease
liver disease
diabetes, especially if it�s not well controlled
high blood pressure
heart failure
morbid obesity
If you�re ill or being treated in a hospital�s intensive care unit, you�re at an extremely high risk for acute kidney failure. Being the recipient of heart surgery, abdominal surgery, or a bone marrow transplant can also increase your risk."
acute kidney injury,acute kidney injury symptoms,"The symptoms of acute kidney failure include:
bloody stools
breath odor
slow, sluggish movements
generalized swelling or fluid retention
fatigue
pain between ribs and hips
hand tremor
bruising easily
changes in mental status or mood, especially in older adults
decreased appetite
decreased sensation, especially in your hands or feet
prolonged bleeding
seizures
nausea
vomiting
high blood pressure
a metallic taste in your mouth"
acute kidney injury,acute kidney injury diagnosis,"If you have acute kidney failure, you may have generalized swelling. The swelling is due to fluid retention.
Using a stethoscope, your doctor may hear crackling in the lungs. These sounds can signal fluid retention.
Results of laboratory tests may also show abnormal values, which are new and different from baseline levels. Some of these tests include:
blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
serum potassium
serum sodium
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
urinalysis
creatinine clearance
serum creatinine
An ultrasound is the preferred method for diagnosing acute kidney failure. However, abdominal X-ray, abdominal CT scan, and abdominal MRI can help your doctor determine if there�s a blockage in your urinary tract.
Certain blood tests may also reveal underlying causes of acute kidney failure."
acute kidney injury,acute kidney injury treatment,"Your treatment will depend on the cause of your acute kidney failure. The goal is to restore normal kidney function. Preventing fluids and wastes from building up in your body while your kidneys recover is important. In the majority of cases, a kidney specialist called a �nephrologist� makes an evaluation.
Diet
Your doctor will restrict your diet and the amount of liquids you eat and drink. This will reduce the buildup of toxins that the kidneys would normally eliminate. A diet high in carbohydrates and low in protein, salt, and potassium is usually recommended.
Medications
Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to treat or prevent any infections that occur at the same time. Diuretics may help your kidneys eliminate fluid. Calcium and insulin can help you avoid dangerous increases in your blood potassium levels.
Dialysis
You may need dialysis, but it�s not always necessary, and it will likely only be temporary. Dialysis involves diverting blood out of your body into a machine that filters out waste. The clean blood then returns to your body. If your potassium levels are dangerously high, dialysis can save your life.
Dialysis is necessary if there are changes in your mental status or if you stop urinating. You may also need dialysis if you develop pericarditis or inflammation of the heart. Dialysis can help eliminate nitrogen waste products from your body."
acute kidney injury,acute kidney injury complications,"Some of the complications of acute kidney failure include:
chronic kidney failure
heart damage
nervous system damage
end-stage renal failure
high blood pressure"
acute kidney injury,acute kidney injury prevention,"Preventing and treating illnesses that can lead to acute kidney failure is the best method for avoiding the disease. According to the Mayo Clinic, having a healthy lifestyle that includes regular physical activity and a sensible diet can help to prevent kidney failure. Work with your doctor to manage existing medical conditions that could lead to acute kidney failure."
mitral valve prolapse,mitral valve prolapse definition,"What is mitral valve prolapse?
You have two chambers on the left side of your heart: your left atrium and your left ventricle. Your mitral valve, which is located between the two, is designed to allow blood flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle, but not back the other way.
In mitral valve prolapse (MVP), also called Barlow�s syndrome, the flaps of the mitral valve don�t close correctly. Instead, the valve bulges into the atrium. This can lead to mitral valve regurgitation, which means that blood leaks back into the left atrium through the prolapsed valve.
Only about 2 percent
of Americans have mitral valve prolapse, according to the American Heart Association. And among these cases, serious complications are uncommon. Most of the time, people with MVP don�t have any symptoms, and it doesn�t affect their daily lives."
mitral valve prolapse,mitral valve prolapse risks,"Experts don�t know exactly what causes MVP. Most people are born with abnormalities that cause the condition. These may include mitral valve flaps that are too big, thick, or stretchy.
The Cleveland Clinic reports that MVP is most commonly found in females. It�s also found more often in people born with disorders of the connective tissue (collagen, ligaments, tendons, and so on).
MVP often runs in families, so you may be more likely to have it if your parents or other relatives do.
Certain conditions may lead to mitral valve prolapse. These include:
scoliosis, or curvature of the spine
adult polycystic kidney disease, a genetic condition in which large cysts interfere with kidney function
connective tissue problems such as Marfan�s syndrome, a genetic condition that affects the connective tissue of the skeletal and cardiovascular systems, eyes, and skin"
mitral valve prolapse,mitral valve prolapse symptoms,"Because mitral valve prolapse often causes no symptoms, most people with this condition are unaware that they have heart problems.
If you do develop symptoms, they will generally be mild. The onset of symptoms is typically slow and gradual rather than abrupt.
When symptoms do occur, they may include:
cough
dizziness
fatigue and tiredness
shortness of breath, especially during exercise or when lying flat
You might also develop migraines (recurring headaches that can cause nausea) or experience pain in your chest. This pain is not caused by heart muscle blood flow seen with heart attacks. Your heartbeat might feel fast or irregular."
mitral valve prolapse,mitral valve prolapse diagnosis,"Your doctor will generally perform several tests to better understand your heart before making a diagnosis.
In most cases, your doctor will initially detect MVP when using a stethoscope to listen to your heart. If you have the condition, your heart may make a clicking sound when it beats. This sound is usually more noticeable when you are standing. Hearing this click might lead your doctor to order further tests.
Your doctor may order an X-ray or an echocardiogram. Both of these tests provide images of your heart, but the echocardiogram shows more structural details. Your doctor can check the images to see if you have MVP or regurgitation. Depending on your condition, your doctor may also perform a cardiac catheterization. In this procedure, dye (which is visible on X-rays) is injected into the arteries of your heart using a catheter (tube) that has been threaded through a blood vessel in your neck, arm, or upper thigh.
Your doctor might ask you to exercise on a treadmill or perform some other physical activity to see how your heart responds. This is called a stress test.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a way to check your heartbeat for irregularities. It is a recording of a few seconds of your heart�s electrical activity. This can help your doctor diagnose mitral valve prolapse or other heart conditions."
partial paralysis,partial paralysis definition,"Paresis is a condition in which muscle movement is weakened. Unlike paralysis, individuals with paresis still have some control over the affected muscles.
Paresis occurs due to nerve damage, which can be caused by a variety of factors or conditions.
Keep reading as we dive deeper into what paresis is, what causes it, and how it may be treated."
partial paralysis,partial paralysis causes,"There are many different factors that can cause nerve damage that results in paresis.
Several examples of causes include:
head injury
spinal cord injury
pressure on the spinal cord or nerves due to things like inflammation, bone spurs, or a tumor
stroke
seizures
multiple sclerosis (MS)
cerebral palsy
diabetes
certain infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus and syphilis
Guillain-Barr� syndrome
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
Just as there are many potential causes of paresis, there are also many different types of paresis.
Below are several examples of different types of paresis:
Monoparesis. Monoparesis muscle weakness that affects one limb, such as a leg or an arm.
Paraparesis. Paraparesis is muscle weakness that affects both legs.
Hemiparesis. Hemiparesis is muscle weakness that affects one side of your body, such as the left arm and left leg.
Quadriparesis. Quadriparesis is muscle weakness that affects all four limbs.
Bell�s palsy. Bell�s palsy is a condition that leads to temporary weakness in your facial muscles, which can cause facial drooping and pain.
Vocal cord paresis. Vocal cord paresis affects the movement of your vocal cords. The condition often leads to a soft voice or hoarseness, as well as feelings of breathlessness when speaking.
Gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is a condition where the emptying of the stomach is impaired due to muscle weakness. It�s associated with symptoms like nausea, vomiting, bloating, and feeling full quickly.
Todd�s paresis. Todd�s paresis is a type of paresis that occurs following a seizure. It�s often associated with paresis in one limb (monoparesis) or on one side of the body (hemiparesis).
Neurosyphilis. Neurosyphilis occurs when a syphilis infection attacks the nervous system. It can cause paresis as well as headaches, changes in behavior, and dementia.
Spastic paresis. Spastic paresis is a condition that causes muscle overactivity and spasticity. It�s due to nerve damage that often results from conditions like stroke, MS, and cerebral palsy. This can lead to pain as well as difficulty with activities like walking or getting dressed."
partial paralysis,partial paralysis symptoms,"Muscle weakness is the main symptom of paresis.
Other common symptoms can include:
muscle stiffness
a tingling or �pins and needles� feeling
decreased sensation in the affected area
Some types of paresis may have slightly different or additional symptoms.
Symptoms of paresis can come on suddenly, as in the case of a head or spinal cord injury. They may come on gradually in other instances, such as with a condition like MS.
Depending on the cause, symptoms may be temporary or permanent. They may also progressively get worse, leading to paralysis, as with ALS."
partial paralysis,partial paralysis treatment,"Treatment for paresis depends on what�s causing it. It focuses on addressing any underlying conditions and improving quality of life.
Examples of possible treatment options include:
Physical therapy. Physical therapy uses techniques such as exercise and massage to aid in promoting mobility, improving flexibility and range of motion, and stimulating your nerves and muscles.
Occupational therapy. Occupational therapy can teach you strategies for carrying out your day-to-day activities more easily while you�re experiencing paresis.
Assistive devices. Assistive devices are items that can help with your mobility and daily activities. Examples include:
walkers
wheelchairs
grab bars
specialized handles and grips
voice-activated technology
Medications. In some cases, medications may help treat a condition that�s causing paresis. Examples include:
antimicrobial medications for infections
corticosteroids to reduce inflammation that�s putting pressure on a nerve"
paranoid personality disorder,paranoid personality disorder definition,"Paranoia can cause you to feel mistrustful of others or persecuted without a threat. Treatment can depend on the cause but may include psychotherapy and medication.
Paranoia is a thought process that causes you to have an irrational suspicion or mistrust of others. People with paranoia may feel like they�re being persecuted or that someone is out to get them. They may feel the threat of physical harm even if they aren�t in danger.
People with dementia sometimes have paranoia, and it also can occur in people who use drugs. Paranoid thoughts can also be a symptom of a mental illness or a personality disorder."
paranoid personality disorder,paranoid personality disorder symptoms,"Everyone experiences paranoid thoughts at some point in their life, but paranoia is the constant experience of symptoms and unfounded feelings of paranoia. The symptoms of paranoia vary in severity and can interfere with all areas of life. Symptoms include:
constant stress or anxiety related to beliefs they have about others
mistrust of others
feeling disbelieved or misunderstood
feeling victimized or persecuted when there isn�t a threat
isolation
Mistrust of others and constant anxiety can make relationships and interactions with others difficult, causing problems with employment and personal relationships.
People with paranoia may feel that others are plotting against them or trying to cause them physical or emotional harm, and maybe even stealing from them. They may be unable to work with others and can be hostile or detached, leading to isolation.
Paranoid schizophrenia is a form of mental illness. People with schizophrenia tend to be distrustful of others and may be suspicious and guarded. They may also have delusions or believe that others are trying to hurt them. A person with schizophrenia may also experience hallucinations."
paranoid personality disorder,paranoid personality disorder causes,"Paranoid behavior usually occurs due to personality disorders or other mental illnesses such as schizophrenia.
It�s not fully understood why some people develop personality disorders or mental illness. It may be a combination of factors, including:
genetics
stress
brain chemistry
Drug use can also cause paranoia. The use of methamphetamines can cause paranoid behavior and delusions. Other drugs that can lead to paranoid thought processes include PCP and LSD."
paranoid personality disorder,paranoid personality disorder diagnosis,"Your doctor will perform a medical exam and take a complete medical history to help them rule out a physical or medical reason for your symptoms, such as dementia.
If your paranoia is part of a psychiatric issue, your doctor will refer you to a psychiatrist or a psychologist who will perform an evaluation and psychological tests to help them determine your mental status.
Other conditions that can occur in people with paranoia are:
bipolar disorder
anxiety
depression"
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea definition,"Overview
Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) causes sudden shortness of breath during sleep. As a result, you wake up gasping for air. It tends to occur within a few hours after you�ve fallen asleep.
The condition can also be defined by the meaning of its name:
Dyspnea can occur at any time of the day or night. It�s a potential symptom of a number of serious respiratory and circulatory diseases, including:
Read on to find out what health conditions can cause PND, and how it�s treated."
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea symptoms,"PND tends to occur within a few hours after you�ve fallen asleep. It wakes you up. You might gasp for air, cough, or sit or stand up to try to open your airways. After a while, your breathing may return to normal. It might take a half an hour, or sometimes longer, to recover.
Many people find it difficult to return to sleep after an episode of PND. PND can be distressing, and one or more episodes may lead to sleep anxiety or even insomnia.
If sitting or standing up doesn�t relieve symptoms of PND, you should call for emergency medical assistance right away."
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea causes,"There is a lack of consensus over the term �paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.� Some medical professionals use it to refer exclusively to a symptom of heart failure. In other cases, it�s used to describe nighttime shortness of breath caused by other medical conditions, some of which are benign.
Some of the most common causes of nighttime shortness of breath are described below.
Heart failure
Heart failure, also known as congestive heart failure, occurs when the heart muscle struggles to adequately pump blood throughout the body. It can lead to fluid buildup in the lungs (pulmonary edema) and around the lungs, which can make it difficult to breathe. Many people with heart failure also experience difficulty breathing when exerting themselves or laying down.
Respiratory conditions
PND can also be related to lung and respiratory system function. Respiratory conditions that can cause or lead to PND include:
asthma
COPD
postnasal drip
pulmonary edema
sleep apnea
pulmonary artery embolism
restrictive lung disease
Other medical conditions
PND can also be related to a variety of other conditions. Some of these include:
stomach acid reflux
kidney failure
anxiety or panic attacks
PND is serious. You should see a doctor to determine what�s causing your nighttime shortness of breath."
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea diagnosis,"Your doctor will try to determine the underlying cause of your PND. They�ll ask you about your medical history and symptoms, and conduct tests to assess your heart and lungs.
Diagnostic tests can include one or more of the following:
biopsy
blood tests
bronchoscopy
chest CT scan
chest X-ray
coronary artery angiogram
echocardiogram, or a cardiac ultrasound
12-lead electrocardiogram
chest MRI scan
pulmonary function test (spirometry testing)
cardiac stress test
thoracoscopy"
pulmonary edema,pulmonary edema definition,"Pulmonary edema is a serious condition that occurs when the lungs fill with fluid. This prevents the body from gaining the oxygen it needs. It is typically caused by another condition, such as heart failure or altitude sickness.
Pulmonary edema is a condition in which the lungs fill with fluid. It�s also known as lung congestion, lung water, and pulmonary congestion. When pulmonary edema occurs, the body struggles to get enough oxygen, and you may experience shortness of breath or wheezing.
Pulmonary edema can range in severity. Some people may need critical care. Often, treatment involves treating pulmonary edema along with the related underlying condition.
Timely treatment can improve possible outcomes."
pulmonary edema,pulmonary edema causes,"Several possible health conditions and external factors can cause pulmonary edema.
Congestive heart failure
Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a common cause
of pulmonary edema.
Heart failure happens when the heart can no longer pump blood properly throughout the body. This creates a backup of pressure in the small blood vessels in the lungs, which causes the vessels to leak fluid.
Typically, the lungs will take oxygen from the air you breathe and put it into the bloodstream. But when fluid fills your lungs, they cannot put oxygen into the bloodstream. This deprives the rest of the body of oxygen.
Other medical conditions
Other less common medical conditions that can cause pulmonary edema include:
heart attack, or other heart diseases
leaking, narrowed, or damaged heart valves
cardiomyopathy
cardiac arrhythmias
sudden high blood pressure
pneumonia
kidney failure
lung damage caused by severe infection
severe sepsis of the blood, or blood poisoning caused by infection
External factors
Some external factors can also put pressure on the heart and lungs and cause pulmonary edema. These include:
high altitude exposure
drug misuse or overdose
lung damage caused by inhalation of toxins
severe trauma
major injury
near drowning"
pulmonary edema,pulmonary edema symptoms,"In cases of pulmonary edema, your body cannot gain oxygen effectively. This is due to the increasing fluid in the lungs preventing oxygen from moving into the bloodstream. Symptoms may continue to worsen until you get treatment.
Symptoms depend on the type of pulmonary edema.
Long-term pulmonary edema
The symptoms of long-term pulmonary edema include:
shortness of breath when physically active
difficulty breathing when lying down
wheezing
waking up at night with a breathless feeling that goes away when you sit up
rapid weight gain, especially in the legs
edema, or swelling in the lower part of the body
fatigue
High-altitude pulmonary edema
Pulmonary edema due to altitude sickness, or not getting enough oxygen in the air, will have symptoms that include:
headaches
irregular, rapid heart rate
shortness of breath after exertion and during rest
coughing
fever
difficulty walking uphill and on flat surfaces
You may need emergency assistance if these symptoms start to get worse. Call 911 or your local emergency services or have someone drive to you the hospital. If you may have pulmonary edema, you should not drive yourself to the hospital."
pulmonary edema,pulmonary edema diagnosis,"If a doctor suspects you may have pulmonary edema, they may look for fluid in your lungs or symptoms caused by it. They may perform a basic physical examination and listen to your lungs with a stethoscope, looking for:
an increased heart rate
rapid breathing
a crackling sound from your lungs
any abnormal heart sounds
A doctor may also look for some signs on your body. These may include:
fluid buildup around your neck
swelling in your legs and abdomen
pale or blue tones in your skin
cold, clammy skin
The doctor may discuss your symptoms and ask about your medical history. They may order additional tests if they believe you have fluid in your lungs.
Examples of tests used in diagnosing pulmonary edema include:
complete blood count
echocardiogram, or an ultrasound, to check for abnormal heart activity
chest X-ray to see fluid
blood tests to check oxygen levels
electrocardiogram (ECG) to look for heart rhythm problems or signs of a heart attack"
pulmonary edema,pulmonary edema treatment,"Pulmonary edema is a serious condition that requires quick treatment. Treatment for pulmonary edema may include
:
Oxygen
Oxygen may be the first line of treatment for this condition, depending on the severity. A healthcare team may prop you up and deliver 100 percent oxygen through an oxygen mask, nasal cannula, or positive pressure mask.
Diuretics
In less severe cases, it may be treated with diuretics, or water pills. You may not have to stay in the hospital. This may be the case if you have congestive heart failure.
Treatment of the underlying condition
A doctor will also diagnose the cause of pulmonary edema and prescribe the appropriate treatment for the underlying cause.
Depending on your condition and the cause of your pulmonary edema, the doctor may also prescribe:
Preload reducers: These help decrease pressure from the fluid going into your heart and lungs. Diuretics also help reduce this pressure by making you urinate, which eliminates fluid.
Afterload reducers: These medications dilate your blood vessels and take pressure off your heart.
Heart medications: These will control your pulse, reduce high blood pressure, and relieve pressure in arteries and veins.
Morphine: This narcotic is used to relieve anxiety and shortness of breath. But fewer doctors today use morphine due to its risks.
Intensive or critical care
In severe cases, people with pulmonary edema may need intensive or critical care.
In other cases of pulmonary edema, you may need treatment to help you breathe. A machine will deliver oxygen under pressure to help get more air into your lungs. Sometimes this can be done with a mask or cannula, also called continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).
Your doctor may need to insert an endotracheal tube, or breathing tube, down your throat and use mechanical ventilation."
pulmonary edema,pulmonary edema risks,"People with heart problems or heart failure are the most at risk for pulmonary edema. Other factors that may put a person at risk include:
history of pulmonary edema
history of lung disease, such as tuberculosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD)
vascular (blood) disorders"
pulmonary edema,pulmonary edema prevention,"There is no way to fully prevent pulmonary edema. Those at high risk should seek immediate attention if they develop symptoms.
The best way to try and prevent pulmonary edema is by taking good care of your health:
Get a pneumonia vaccine
.
Get the flu vaccine, especially if you have heart problems or are an older adult.
Remain on diuretics after an episode of pulmonary edema to prevent a reoccurrence.
You can also decrease your risk for heart failure, the most common cause of pulmonary edema with the following steps:
Visit a doctor regularly.
Avoid smoking or quit smoking if you smoke.
Avoid illegal drugs.
Get regular exercise.
Eat nutritious foods.
Maintain your weight."
lymphedema,lymphedema definition,"Lymphangitis is an inflammation of the lymphatic system. If it�s treated quickly, it often goes away with no ill effects. If left untreated, complications can occur, and the condition can become serious.
Your lymphatic system is a network of organs, cells, ducts, and glands. The glands are also called nodes and can be found throughout your body. They are most apparent under your jaw, in your armpits, and in your groin.
Organs that make up the lymphatic system include your:
Immune cells called lymphocytes mature within your bone marrow and then travel to your lymph nodes and other organs within the lymphatic system to help protect your body against viruses and bacteria. The lymphatic system also filters a whitish-clear fluid called lymph, which contains bacteria-killing white blood cells.
Lymph travels through your body along lymphatic vessels and collects fats, bacteria, and other waste products from cells and tissues. Your lymph nodes then filter these harmful materials out of the fluid and produce more white blood cells to fight off the infection.
Infectious lymphangitis occurs when viruses and bacteria invade the vessels of your lymphatic system, typically through an infected cut or wound. Tender red streaks often radiate from the wound toward the nearest lymph glands. Other symptoms include fever, chills, and a general sense of illness.
Lymphangitis is sometimes incorrectly called blood poisoning. It�s also sometimes mistaken for thrombophlebitis, which is a clot in a vein."
lymphedema,lymphedema causes,"Infectious lymphangitis occurs when bacteria or viruses enter the lymphatic channels. They may enter through a cut or wound, or they may grow from an existing infection.
The most common infectious cause of lymphangitis is acute streptococcal infection. It may also be the result of a staphylococcal (staph) infection. Both of these are bacterial infections.
Lymphangitis may occur if you already have a skin infection and it�s getting worse. This might mean that bacteria will soon enter your bloodstream. Complications such as sepsis, a life-threatening condition of body-wide inflammation, can occur as a result.
Conditions that increase your risk of lymphangitis include:
diabetes
immunodeficiency, or loss of immune function
chronic steroid use
chickenpox
A cat or dog bite or a wound made in fresh water can also become infected and lead to lymphangitis. Gardeners and farmers may develop the condition if they get sporotrichosis, a soil-borne fungal infection.
There are also noninfectious causes of lymphangitis. Inflammation of lymph vessels can occur due to malignancy: Breast, lung, stomach, pancreas, rectal, and prostate cancers are common types of tumors that can lead to lymphangitis. Lymphangitis has also been seen in those with Crohn�s disease."
lymphedema,lymphedema symptoms,"Red streaks often trace the surface of the skin from the infected area to the nearest lymph gland. They may be faint or very visible and tender to the touch. They may extend from a wound or cut. In some cases, the streaks may blister.
Other symptoms include:
chills
swollen lymph glands
fever
malaise, or a general ill feeling
loss of appetite
headache
aching muscles"
lymphedema,lymphedema diagnosis,"To diagnose lymphangitis, your doctor will perform a physical exam. They�ll feel your lymph nodes to check for swelling.
Your doctor may also order tests such as a biopsy to reveal the cause of the swelling or a blood culture to see if the infection is present in your blood."
lymphedema,lymphedema complications,"Lymphangitis can spread quickly, leading to complications such as:
cellulitis, a skin infection
bacteremia, or bacteria in your blood
sepsis, a body-wide infection that�s life-threatening
abscess, a painful collection of pus that�s usually accompanied by swelling and inflammation
If bacteria enter your bloodstream, the condition can be life-threatening. Visit your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any of the following:
increasing pain or redness at the site of the infection
growing red streaks
pus or fluid coming from the lymph node
fever over 101�F (38.3�C) for more than two days
Take antibiotics as prescribed to help prevent complications. Don�t miss a dose, especially in the first few days of treatment."
aortic valve stenosis,aortic valve stenosis definition,"Aortic valve stenosis occurs when the aortic valve narrows and doesn�t open as it should. It can cause chest pain and shortness of breath, especially after exertion.
Aortic stenosis limits the amount of blood pumped from your heart into and out of the aorta. This is the main artery of the body. The aortic valve is a key valve in the body�s blood circulation system.
Untreated, aortic valve stenosis can be serious or deadly. Early treatment options aim to help slow disease progression or repair or replace the narrowed valve.
Keep reading to learn more about the symptoms, causes, and treatment options available for aortic valve stenosis."
aortic valve stenosis,aortic valve stenosis symptoms,"You may not experience symptoms of aortic valve stenosis until the disease progresses and becomes severe. The asymptomatic period may last as long as 10 to 20 years
. Some people may not experience any symptoms.
Symptoms of severe aortic valve stenosis can include:
chest pain
feeling tired after exertion
shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, especially after exertion
dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting
difficulty sleeping, or only being able to sleep sitting up
heart palpitations, or abnormal heartbeats
a heart murmur, which is an abnormal swooshing sound produced by the heart as it beats
a reduced ability to do your typical activities, including walking short distances
swollen ankles or feet"
aortic valve stenosis,aortic valve stenosis symptoms,"Infants and children may have different symptoms from adults, or they may not appear to display any symptoms at all. If they do display symptoms, these may include:
inability to put on weight
poor feeding or eating
becoming easily fatigued
breathing issues
In severe cases, an infant may have significant breathing difficulties that develop within weeks of birth. Without treatment, mild cases can potentially worsen as the child gets older."
aortic valve stenosis,aortic valve stenosis causes,"Congenital heart defects, age-related damage, and certain health conditions may prevent the aortic valve from completing its proper functions.
Rheumatic fever
Rheumatic fever is a common cause
of heart valve problems in developing countries without effective antibiotic treatment. Rheumatic fever may affect many parts of the body, including the:
brain
joints
heart
skin
Rheumatic fever can occur in adults and children who have or have had strep throat. Strep throat is a contagious condition caused by Streptococcus bacteria.
Calcification of the valves
Aortic valve stenosis can happen due to calcium buildup (calcification) or scarring of the aortic valve. Aortic valve stenosis may occur in as many as 20% of older adults, according to the American Heart Association
. It is most common in people age 65 and older.
While your body needs calcium for strong bones, the mineral may lead to problems in your heart if it deposits in the aortic valve. Calcium deposits usually affect the leaflets of the aortic valve. They can prevent the aortic valve from properly opening and closing.
Improperly functioning aortic valve leaflets may also allow blood to leak back into the left ventricle after it enters the aorta. This is called valvular insufficiency or regurgitation.
It may also be more common
in people with certain health conditions, including lupus and end-stage renal disease.
Heart defect
Children may experience aortic valve stenosis due to a heart defect where the aortic valve doesn�t develop properly. When it is, the aortic valve�s flaps, or �leaflets,� irregularly formed. Typically, these leaflets make up the opening of the aortic valve. When functioning properly, they fit together tightly when closed.
Children born with aortic valve stenosis usually have one of the following irregularities in their aortic valve leaflets:
There are only one or two leaflets.
The leaflets don�t separate properly.
The leaflets are too thick or still to completely open or close.
Having an aortic valve with only two leaflets (a bicuspid aortic valve) can lead to increased calcification and then aortic stenosis."
aortic valve stenosis,aortic valve stenosis risks,"The risk factors for aortic valve stenosis include:
Age
Adults over age 65
may be more likely to develop aortic valve stenosis.
Genetics
Children born with either malformed valve leaflets or fewer than three leaflets typically have problems with sufficient blood flow through the aorta.
Disease
Rheumatic fever can produce significant problems with the valve leaflets. Scar tissue from the disease can make the leaflets hard or even fused together. Rheumatic fever can damage:
heart tissue
valves
coronary arteries
Risk factors for quick progression
Some factors can cause aortic valve stenosis to progress more quickly. These can include:
a high BMI
tobacco use
metabolic syndrome
high cholesterol
high blood pressure"
aortic valve stenosis,aortic valve stenosis diagnosis,"After reporting your symptoms to a doctor, you may be referred to a heart specialist (cardiologist). They typically check your physical condition with a thorough examination. This includes listening to your heart for any abnormal sounds. A doctor typically orders an echocardiogram to view the condition of the heart chambers and heart valves.
The doctor may order additional tests to show what�s happening inside your heart. These tests may include:
cardiac catheterization, which uses dye to assess the pressure and flow of blood through the heart chambers
other imaging tests, such as a chest X-ray, chest MRI, or CT scan of your heart
a stress test
blood test for inflammation of the heart valve (endocarditis) or rheumatic fever"
fluid overload,fluid overload definition,"Hypervolemia occurs if your body retains too much fluid. You can experience swelling, discomfort, and other symptoms. Untreated, hypervolemia can cause severe complications, including heart failure."
fluid overload,fluid overload symptoms,"The symptoms of hypervolemia can include:
swelling, also called edema, most often in the feet, ankles, wrists, and face
discomfort in the body, causing cramping, headache, and stomach bloating
high blood pressure caused by excess fluid in the bloodstream
shortness of breath caused by extra fluid entering your lungs and reducing your ability to breathe normally
heart problems, because excess fluid can speed up or slow your heart rate, harm your heart muscles, and increase the size of your heart
increased weight, caused by excess fluid
When it�s an emergency
If you experience severe symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, severe pain, or irregular heart rhythm, call 911 or your local emergency services, or visit a local emergency department.
Was this helpful?"
fluid overload,fluid overload causes,"Often, problems with your kidneys cause hypervolemia. This is because the kidneys normally balance the salts and fluids in your body.
But when they retain salt, they increase the body�s total sodium content, which increases your fluid content.
The most common causes of hypervolemia can include:
heart failure, specifically of the right ventricle
cirrhosis, often caused by excess alcohol consumption or hepatitis
kidney failure, often caused by diabetes and other metabolic disorders
nephrotic syndrome, a disorder that causes excess excretion of protein in the urine
premenstrual edema, or swelling that occurs prior to a woman�s menstrual cycle
pregnancy, which changes a woman�s hormonal balance and can result in fluid retention
You can also experience hypervolemia from being on an IV, which can cause your sodium levels to be unbalanced. It can also occur if you consume too much sodium."
fluid overload,fluid overload diagnosis,"If you believe you�re experiencing hypervolemia, talk with a doctor. They can determine if you�re experiencing this condition.
First, a doctor typically conducts a physical exam. The key signs of hypervolemia include weight gain and swelling. One or more parts of your body may appear swollen, depending on whether or not you have been sitting, lying, or standing before your visit.
The doctor is also likely to perform a blood test to check your sodium levels. While your body�s total sodium levels will looked elevated if you have hypervolemia, your sodium levels in the blood work may be high, normal, or low.
Performing a sodium test on your urine can help determine if your kidneys are causing your hypervolemia or if there is another cause.
For renal failure, urinary sodium content is typically greater than 20 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L), while in cases of heart failure, cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome, it is typically less than 10 mEq/L.
If you are hospitalized, your care team may measure your fluid intake and output and your weight to check for hypervolemia."
fluid overload,fluid overload causes,"Untreated hypervolemia can cause several complications, some of which can be life threatening. These can include:
pericarditis, or swelling of the heart tissues
heart failure
delayed wound healing
tissue breakdown
decreased bowel function"
peptic ulcer,peptic ulcer definition,"Some types of ulcers, like arterial ulcers, can take months to clear or may not even heal at all. Other types, like peptic or stomach ulcers, can take a month to heal with proper treatment.
An ulcer is a painful sore that is slow to heal and sometimes recurs. Ulcers aren�t uncommon. Why they appear and their corresponding symptoms typically depend on their underlying causes.
Ulcers can appear anywhere in or on your body, from the lining in your stomach to the outer layer of your skin.
Sometimes ulcers disappear on their own. Other times they require medical treatment to prevent serious complications."
peptic ulcer,peptic ulcer symptoms,"The most common symptom of a peptic ulcer is stomach pain. Often, the pain starts in the center of your stomach and can travel up to your throat or seemingly down your back. This pain can last for a few minutes to a few hours and is usually only temporarily eased by antacids.
You may also feel ill if you have a stomach ulcer and may lose weight.
Serious complications of peptic ulcers include:
vomiting blood
passing dark, tarry stools
a sudden, sharp pain in your stomach that only gets worse, not better
There is no difference between stomach ulcer symptoms in men versus stomach ulcer symptoms in women; however, men are typically more predisposed to developing these types of ulcers, according to the National Health Service (NHS)."
kidney failure,kidney failure definition,"Kidney failure occurs when your kidneys lose the ability to filter waste from your blood sufficiently. It may not cause symptoms in the early stages.
Your kidneys filter your blood and remove toxins from your body. These toxins go to your bladder and are eliminated when you urinate. When this doesn�t work properly, you can get kidney failure.
If your kidneys aren�t able to function properly, toxins can overwhelm your body. This can lead to kidney failure, which can be life threatening if left untreated.
Keep reading as we break down everything you need to know about kidney failure, including symptoms, stages, treatment, and the typical outlook."
kidney failure,kidney failure symptoms,"Early-stage kidney failure often doesn�t cause noticeable symptoms. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
, about 90% of people with chronic kidney disease don�t know they have it.
As kidney disease progresses, symptoms may include:
reduced amount of urine
swelling of your legs, ankles, and feet from fluid retention
shortness of breath
trouble sleeping
muscle cramping at night
excessive drowsiness or fatigue
persistent nausea
confusion
chest pain or pressure
seizures
coma
Early signs of kidney failure
Symptoms of early-stage kidney disease may be subtle and hard to identify. They may include:
decreased urine output
swelling in limbs
shortness of breath
Kidney failure urine color
The color of your urine doesn�t tell you much about the state of your kidney function until damage to the kidneys has progressed.
Still, urine color changes may be an early indicator of some issues.
Urine color Indication
clear or pale yellow well-hydrated
dark yellow or amber dehydrated
orange dehydration or bile in the bloodstream
pink or red blood in the urine or having eaten certain foods, like beets
foamy contains a lot of protein; potentially an indicator of kidney disease"
kidney failure,kidney failure causes,"Kidney failure can result from various causes. According to the National Kidney Foundation, the two most common include high blood pressure and diabetes.
People who are most at risk usually have one or more of the following:
Loss of blood flow to the kidneys
A sudden loss of blood flow to your kidneys can prompt kidney failure. Some causes include:
heart attack
heart disease
scarring of the liver or liver failure
dehydration
severe burns
allergic reactions
severe infection, such as sepsis
High blood pressure and anti-inflammatory medications can also limit blood flow.
Urine elimination problems
When your body can�t eliminate urine, toxins build up and overload the kidneys. Some cancers can block the urine passageways, such as:
prostate
colon
cervical
bladder
Other conditions can interfere with urination and possibly lead to kidney failure, including:
kidney stones
enlarged prostate
blood clots within your urinary tract
damage to the nerves that control your bladder
Other causes
Other factors that may lead to kidney failure include:
a blood clot in or around your kidneys
heavy metal poisoning
drugs and alcohol use
vasculitis, an inflammation of the blood vessels
lupus, an autoimmune disease that can cause inflammation of many body organs
glomerulonephritis, an inflammation of the small blood vessels of the kidneys
hemolytic uremic syndrome, which involves the breakdown of red blood cells following a bacterial infection, usually of the intestines
multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cells in your bone marrow
scleroderma, an autoimmune condition that affects your skin
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a disorder that causes blood clots in small vessels
chemotherapy drugs that treat cancer and some autoimmune diseases
dyes used in some imaging tests
certain antibiotics
unmanaged diabetes"
kidney failure,kidney failure diagnosis,"Doctors use several tests to diagnose kidney failure. Common tests include:
Urinalysis: A urine sample can show how much protein or sugar is in your urine. A urinary sediment examination looks for red and white blood cells, high levels of bacteria, and high numbers of cellular casts.
Urine volume measurements: Measuring urine output can help diagnose kidney failure. Low output may suggest that kidney disease is due to a urinary blockage.
Blood samples: Blood tests can measure substances filtered by your kidneys, such as blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. A rapid rise in these levels may indicate acute kidney failure.
Imaging: Tests like ultrasounds, MRIs, and CT scans provide images of your kidneys and urinary tract to identify issues.
Kidney tissue sample: Doctors use a kidney biopsy to collect and examine tissue samples."
kidney failure,kidney failure treatment,"The type of treatment you need depends on the cause and stage of your kidney failure.
Dialysis
Dialysis filters and purifies the blood using a machine to performs the function of the kidneys. Depending on the type of dialysis, you may be connected to a large machine or a portable catheter bag.
Along with dialysis, you may need to follow a low potassium, low salt diet.
Dialysis doesn�t cure kidney failure, but going to regularly scheduled treatments can extend your life.
Kidney transplant
A transplanted kidney can work fully, so you no longer need dialysis.
There�s usually a long wait to receive a donor kidney that�s compatible with your body. If you have a living donor, the process may go more quickly.
Transplant surgery might not be the right treatment option for everyone. It is not always successful.
You must take immunosuppressant drugs after the surgery to prevent your body from rejecting the new kidney. These drugs have their own side effects, some of which can be serious.
You can talk with a doctor about whether you�re a good candidate for a kidney transplant.
Lifestyle modifications
Minimizing your intake of alcohol and making dietary changes may help prevent kidney failure from progressing.
At the early stages and beyond, it�s possible to manage and slow progression with lifestyle factors such as:
Dietary changes
The guidelines for what you eat will often depend on the stage of kidney disease you have and your overall health. Some recommendations might include:
Limiting sodium and potassium: Aim to eat less than 2,000 milligrams per day of both sodium (salt) and potassium.
Limiting phosphorus: Try to stay below 1,000 milligrams
of phosphorus.
Following protein guidelines: In early and moderate kidney disease, you might want to cut back on protein consumption. But you may eat more protein in end-stage kidney failure, depending on your doctor�s recommendations.
Beyond these general guidelines, a doctor may also ask you to avoid certain foods.
Lowering alcohol intake
If you have kidney failure and drink alcohol, your kidneys must work harder than they already do. Alcohol doesn�t metabolize out of your system, so if you have complete kidney failure, you�ll feel its effects until you receive dialysis to filter it from your blood.
Beer, ale, and wine also contain large amounts of phosphorous. Severe heart issues and death are possible if your kidneys cannot filter it out.
If you have kidney failure or late-stage kidney disease, a doctor may recommend you limit alcohol. Eliminating alcohol from your diet, if possible, may be best."
kidney failure,kidney failure complications,"Kidney failure can lead to various complications. These can include:
anemia
bone weakness, due to an imbalance of phosphorus and calcium
fluid retention (edema)
heart disease
high potassium levels (hyperkalemia)
metabolic acidosis, when the blood becomes too acidic
Many people with kidney failure develop secondary complications. These can include:
depression
liver failure
fluid buildup in the lungs
gout
nerve damage
skin infections"
kidney failure,kidney failure prevention,"You can take steps to lower the risk of kidney failure.
Follow directions when taking over-the-counter medications. Taking doses that are too high, even of common drugs like aspirin, can create high toxin levels quickly. This can overload your kidneys.
Many kidney or urinary tract conditions lead to kidney failure without prompt treatment.
You can help lower your risk of kidney failure by:
eating a balanced diet
maintaining a moderate weight
taking prescribed and over-the-counter medications as directed and not taking more medication than is safe
keeping conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, well managed and following a doctor�s advice"
heart failure,heart failure definition,"Heart failure occurs when your heart cannot pump enough blood to support your body functions. Seek help immediately if you�re experiencing symptoms such as heart palpitations, shortness of breath, or swelling.
Heart failure is characterized by the heart�s inability to pump an adequate supply of blood to the body. Without sufficient blood flow, all major body functions are disrupted. Heart failure is a condition or a collection of symptoms that weaken or stiffen your heart.
In some people with heart failure, the heart has difficulty pumping enough blood to support other organs in the body. Other people may have a hardening and stiffening of the heart muscle itself, which blocks or reduces blood flow to the heart.
Heart failure can affect the right or left side of your heart or both at the same time. It can be either an acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing) condition.
About 6.2 million Americans
have heart failure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Most cases are diagnosed in men. However, women are more likely to die from heart failure when the condition goes untreated.
Heart failure is a serious medical condition that requires treatment. Early treatment increases your chances of long-term recovery with fewer complications. Call your doctor right away if you�re having any symptoms of heart failure."
heart failure,heart failure causes,"Heart failure is most often related to another condition. The most common cause of heart failure is coronary artery disease (CAD), a disorder that causes narrowing of the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart. Other conditions that may increase your risk of developing heart failure include:
cardiomyopathy, a disorder of the heart muscle that causes the heart to become weak
congenital heart disease
heart attack
heart valve disease
certain types of arrhythmias, or irregular heart rhythms
high blood pressure
emphysema, a disease of the lung
untreated sleep apnea
diabetes
an overactive or underactive thyroid
HIV
severe forms of anemia
certain cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy
substance misuse disorder"
heart failure,heart failure symptoms,"The symptoms of heart failure may include:
fatigue
sudden weight gain
a loss of appetite
persistent coughing
irregular heart rate
heart palpitations
abdominal swelling
shortness of breath
exercise intolerance
leg and ankle swelling or abdomen
sleeping on extra pillows
getting short of breath while lying down
protruding neck veins"
heart failure,heart failure risks,"Heart failure can happen to anyone. However, certain factors may increase your risk of developing this condition.
There is a higher incidence of heart failure in men compared with women, though the prevalence is about the same for all sexes.
People with diseases that damage the heart are also at an increased risk. These conditions include:
hypertension
sleep apnea
diabetes
coronary artery disease
valve disease
anemia
hyperthyroidism
hypothyroidism
emphysema
Certain behaviors can also increase your risk of developing heart failure, including:
smoking
eating foods that are high in fat or cholesterol
not getting enough exercise
having overweight or obesity"
heart failure,heart failure diagnosis,"Physical exam
Your doctor may perform a physical exam to check for signs of heart failure. For instance, leg swelling, irregular heart rate, and bulging neck veins may lead your doctor to diagnose heart failure.
Echocardiogram
An echocardiogram is the most effective way to diagnose heart failure. It uses sound waves to create detailed pictures of your heart, which help your doctor evaluate the damage to your heart, the squeezing and relaxing function and determine the underlying causes of your condition.
Your doctor may use an echocardiogram along with other tests.
Other tests
chest X-ray This test can provide images of the heart and the surrounding organs.
heart MRI An MRI produces images of the heart without the use of radiation.
nuclear scan A very small dose of radioactive material is injected into your body to create images of the chambers of your heart.
catheterization or coronary angiogram In this type of X-ray exam, the doctor inserts a catheter into your blood vessel, usually in the groin or arm. They then guide it into the heart. This test can show how much blood is currently flowing through the heart.
stress exam During a stress exam, an EKG machine monitors your heart function while you run on a treadmill or perform another type of exercise.
Holter monitoring Electrode patches are placed on your chest and attached to a small machine called a Holter monitor for this test. The machine records the electrical activity of your heart for at least 24 to 48 hours.
BNP blood test A BNP test is done by drawing blood from a vein in your arm. This test can detect a rise in B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) hormone, which can be an indication of heart failure."
heart failure,heart failure prevention,"Some lifestyle measures can help treat heart failure and prevent the condition from developing. Maintaining a moderate weight and exercising regularly can significantly decrease your risk of heart failure. Reducing the amount of salt in your diet can also lower your risk.
Other habits that may prevent heart failure include:
limiting alcohol intake
not smoking
avoiding high fat foods
getting the right amount of sleep
staying active"
heart failure,heart failure complications,"Untreated heart failure can eventually lead to congestive heart failure (CHF), a condition in which blood builds up in other areas of your body. In this potential life threatening condition, you may experience fluid retention in your limbs as well as in your organs, such as the liver and lungs.
Additional complications of heart failure can include:
stroke
thromboembolism
arrhythmias, like atrial fibrillation
kidney dysfunction
Heart attack
A heart attack may also occur because of a complication related to heart failure.
Call 911 or your local emergency services right away if you have these symptoms:
crushing chest pain
discomfort in the chest, such as squeezing or tightness
discomfort in the upper body, including numbness or a coldness
fatigue
dizziness
rapid heart rate
vomiting
nausea
cold sweats"
pulmonary hypertension,pulmonary hypertension definition,"Cor pulmonale is a condition that happens when a respiratory disorder results in high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries (pulmonary hypertension). The name of the condition is in Latin and means �pulmonary heart.�
It�s also known as right-sided heart failure because it occurs within the right ventricle of your heart. Cor pulmonale causes the right ventricle to enlarge and pump blood less effectively than it should. The ventricle is then pushed to its limit and ultimately fails.
It�s possible to prevent this condition by controlling the high pressure of the blood going to the lungs. But untreated pulmonary hypertension can eventually lead to cor pulmonale along with other related, life-threatening complications."
pulmonary hypertension,pulmonary hypertension symptoms,"The symptoms of cor pulmonale may not be noticeable at first because they�re similar to the feelings you get after a hard workout. They include
:
shortness of breath
tiredness
an increased heart rate
lightheadedness
Over time, these symptoms will worsen and flare up even during periods of rest.
Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following symptoms:
chest pain
leg or feet swelling
fainting
excessive coughing
wheezing
excessive fatigue"
pulmonary hypertension,pulmonary hypertension treatment,"In order to treat cor pulmonale, your doctor will need to treat
the underlying cause.
Prescription medications can help decrease blood pressure and help encourage oxygen flow back into the lungs. Diuretics may also be used to get rid of fluid retention and keep your blood sodium levels down. You may also take blood thinners to prevent blood clots.
Severe or advanced cases of cor pulmonale require more aggressive treatments like a heart or lung transplant. In other cases, you may need to have oxygen therapy."
pulmonary hypertension,pulmonary hypertension causes,"The lungs depend on the heart to transport blood from the body to the lungs. Pulmonary hypertension occurs as a result of increased pressure in your lungs� arteries.
This increased pressure can then cause resistance in your heart�s right ventricle. It�s a result of having to overcome the high pressure in the lungs in order to force blood into them.
This increased pressure leads to cor pulmonale, and the result is ineffective transportation of blood to the lungs. This, in turn, will lead to decreased oxygen transport to the rest of the body.
Conditions or events that can cause this include:
pulmonary embolism
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
lung tissue damage
sleep apnea
cystic fibrosis
scleroderma
The most common cause of acute cor pulmonale is typically caused by a pulmonary embolism, which is a blood clot in the lungs. Chronic cor pulmonary most commonly results from COPD."
pulmonary hypertension,pulmonary hypertension diagnosis,"Cor pulmonale is diagnosed with a physical exam and medical testing. Abnormal heart rhythms, fluid retention, and protruding neck veins during a physical exam can indicate the presence of increased pressure and the possibility of cor pulmonale.
Blood tests to detect brain natriuretic peptides, which are amino acids secreted from the heart when it is stressed, may also be ordered.
A doctor may also insert
a right heart catheter to determine if there�s any dysfunction in the right ventricle of your heart. This procedure is known as right heart catheterization or Swan-Ganz catheterization."
pulmonary hypertension,pulmonary hypertension complications,"If not treated promptly, cor pulmonale can lead to the following complications:
An enlarged pulmonary artery
thickening of the walls of the right ventricle of the heart
severe shortness of breath
severe excessive fluid in your body
shock
death"
dysphagia,dysphagia definition,"Some health conditions can make swallowing foods or liquids more difficult. Treatment can include therapy, medications, and dietary changes.
Swallowing difficulty is the inability to swallow foods or liquids with ease. People who have a hard time swallowing may choke on their food or liquid when trying to swallow. Dysphagia is the medical name for difficulty swallowing.
Dysphagia affects about 15 million people in the United States. About 1 in 25 people will experience dysphagia in their lives.
Difficulty swallowing doesn�t always indicate a medical condition. It may be temporary and go away on its own."
dysphagia,dysphagia causes,"According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)
, there are 50 pairs of muscles and nerves used to help you swallow. In other words, there are lots of things that can go wrong and lead to problems swallowing. Some conditions related to difficulty swallowing include:
Acid reflux and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Acid reflux symptoms are caused when stomach contents flow up from the stomach back into the esophagus, causing symptoms like heartburn, stomach pain, and burping. Learn more about the causes, symptoms, and treatment of acid reflux and GERD.
Heartburn. Heartburn is a burning sensation in your chest that often occurs with a bitter taste in your throat or mouth. Find out how to recognize, treat, and prevent heartburn.
Epiglottitis. Epiglottitis is characterized by inflamed tissue in your epiglottis. It�s a potentially life threatening condition. Learn who gets it, why, and how it�s treated. This condition is considered a medical emergency. Urgent care may be required.
Goiter. Your thyroid is a gland found in your neck just below your Adam�s apple. A condition that increases the size of your thyroid is called a goiter. Read more about the causes and symptoms of goiter.
Esophagitis. Esophagitis is inflammation of the esophagus that can be caused by acid reflux or certain medications. Learn more about the types of esophagitis and their treatments.
Esophageal cancer. Esophageal cancer occurs when a malignant (cancerous) tumor forms in the lining of the esophagus, which can cause difficulty swallowing. Read more about esophageal cancer, its causes, diagnosis, and treatment.
Herpes esophagitis. Herpes esophagitis is caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). The infection can cause some chest pain and difficulty swallowing. Learn more about how herpes esophagitis is diagnosed and treated.
Recurrent herpes simplex labialis. Recurrent herpes simplex labialis, also known as oral or orolabial herpes, is an infection of the mouth area caused by the herpes simplex virus. Read about symptoms, treatment, and prevention of this infection.
Thyroid nodule. A thyroid nodule is a lump that can develop in your thyroid gland. It can be solid or filled with fluid. You can have a single nodule or a cluster of nodules. Learn what causes thyroid nodules and how they are treated.
Infectious mononucleosis. Infectious mononucleosis, or mono, refers to a group of symptoms usually caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Learn about the symptoms and treatments for infectious mononucleosis.
Zenker�s diverticulum. A rare instance in which a pouch-like structure forms between the pharynx and the esophagus, making it difficult to swallow. Learn more about the symptoms and causes of Zenker�s diverticulum.
Snake bites. A bite from a venomous snake should always be treated as a medical emergency. Even a bite from a harmless snake can lead to an allergic reaction or infection. Read more about what to do in the event of a snake bite.
Other medical conditions that may produce swallowing problems as a result of either the condition or its treatment include:
stroke
dementia
head, neck, or throat cancer
history of radiation or chemotherapy in the neck or throat for cancer
head injury
neurological disorders, such as Parkinson�s disease
muscular dystrophy"
dysphagia,dysphagia symptoms,"If you think you may have dysphagia, there are certain symptoms that may be present along with difficulty swallowing.
They include:
drooling
hoarse voice
feeling like something is lodged in your throat
regurgitation
unexpected weight loss
heartburn
coughing or choking when swallowing
pain when swallowing
difficulty chewing solid foods
recurrent pneumonia
food may come out of the nose
These sensations may cause a person to:
avoid eating
skip meals
lose their appetite
Children who have difficulty swallowing when eating may:
refuse to eat certain foods
have food or liquid leaking from their mouths
regurgitate during meals
have trouble breathing when eating
lose weight without trying"
dysphagia,dysphagia diagnosis,"Talk with a doctor about your symptoms and when they began. Your doctor will do a physical examination and look in your mouth to check for abnormalities or swelling.
More specialized tests may be needed to find the exact cause.
Barium X-ray
A barium X-ray is often used to check the inside of the esophagus for abnormalities or blockages. During this examination, you will swallow liquid or a pill containing a dye that shows up on an abdominal X-ray.
The doctor or technician will look at the X-ray image as you swallow the liquid or pill to see how the esophagus functions. This will help them identify any weaknesses or abnormalities.
Video fluoroscopy
A videofluoroscopic swallowing evaluation is a radiologic exam that uses a type of X-ray called fluoroscopy. This test is performed by a speech-language pathologist. It shows the oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal phases of the swallow.
During this examination, you�ll swallow a variety of consistencies, ranging from purees to solids and thin and thickened liquid. This process uses a radiopaque dye in the foods. This will show the ingestion of food and liquid into the trachea, or windpipe. Your medical team can use this information to diagnose muscle weakness and dysfunction."
dysphagia,dysphagia treatment,"You will likely coordinate your home treatment for dysphagia with your doctor, who may refer you to a speech therapist or occupational therapist. According to the NIDCD
, your home treatment for dysphagia may include:
Muscle exercises. You may be shown exercises to do at home to strengthen weak facial muscles or to improve coordination.
Eating in a specific position. Sometimes the position of your head makes it easier to swallow. For example, when you eat, you may need to turn your head to one side or look straight ahead.
Preparing food differently. You may need to prepare food in particular ways to make them safe for you to swallow. For example, if you can�t swallow thin liquids, you may need to add thickeners to your drinks.
Avoiding certain foods. You may need to avoid hot or cold foods or drinks.
For examples of exercises that doctors or speech therapists might prescribe to strengthen swallowing, see this selection of five exercises from the Napa Center.
Diet
There are many texture-modified foods for people with dysphagia. Because the consistencies of these foods vary so much, the International Dysphagia Diet Standardization Initiative (IDDSI) has created standardized worldwide terminology and definitions for texture-modified liquids and thickened foods.
The IDDSI standards have five levels or grades of thickening that range from grade 0, which is thin liquid, to grade 4, which is a pudding-like consistency.
The Nutrition Care Manual, the standard dietary resource for professionals established by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND), adopted the IDDSI standards effective October 2021.
Elaine Achilles, author of �The Dysphagia Cookbook,� gives helpful tips and recipes in her book on how to cook and present food for someone with swallowing difficulty.
She learned how to cook this way firsthand when her partner of 17 years was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which makes swallowing progressively difficult. Achilles gives tips like these in her book:
Downsize dish, cup, and utensil size. This will necessitate smaller bites, which is important for people with swallowing difficulty.
Always think about texture. Make it appealing. For example, put meringue on custard.
Emphasize taste and aroma. This will overpower unappealing soft textures and help make food appetizing.
Make the environment nice. A pretty table setting, flowers, and a simple attractive environment can do wonders for the appetite.
It�s important to note that dysphagia with a neurologic cause may present differently than dysphagia with other causes.
The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services summarizes which foods to eat and which to avoid if you have swallowing difficulty. Here are some of its recommendations for foods to avoid or use only when carefully prepared:
Peas and corn. These can roll to the back of the throat and create a choking hazard unless carefully prepared into a puree or porridge.
Meat. Meats can be tiring to chew and can get stuck in the throat or esophagus. Again, proper preparation is necessary.
Rice. It can get stuck in the throat and fall into the airway. It is usable if properly prepared.
Ice cream. Its consistency changes when it melts, and it may become too thin for some people with swallowing difficulty.
Bread. People tend to swallow it too soon, and balls of it become lodged in airways. Gelled bread can be used instead.
Peanut butter. It can be hard for people with swallowing difficulty to process peanut butter, and it may block the airways if aspirated (inhaled into the airway). It cannot be removed by a Heimlich maneuver.
Fibrous cooked vegetables. Some examples include cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and asparagus.
Fresh fruits. Fruits like apples and pears can be hard to chew. Stringy, high pulp fruits like pineapple or oranges are also best avoided unless properly prepared."
Pneumocystis pneumonia,Pneumocystis pneumonia definition,"This type of pneumonia is rare but can be dangerous for those with weakened immune systems. Treatment and diagnosis processes have come a long way in the last few decades.
Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is an infection caused by a fungus called Pneumocystis jirovecii. PCP is a serious infection that most often develops in people with weakened immune systems. The infection is relatively rare in the general population.
The �C� in PCP comes from its previous name. There was a shift in understanding and knowledge about this infection in the 1980s when hospitals began seeing the number of people with it rise among those with HIV and AIDS. Before the 1980s, P. jirovecii was called P. carinii and was classed a protozoal infection. The �C� in the acronym PCP originally stood for carinii.
Although this is no longer correct, the acronym has stayed the same to avoid confusion. Keep reading to learn more about this rare form of pneumonia."
Pneumocystis pneumonia,Pneumocystis pneumonia causes,"The fungus that causes PCP can live in the lungs of most people without causing symptoms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that up to 20% of adults
carry the fungus at any time. Most people�s bodies typically remove the fungus without issue after a few months.
But people with weakened immune systems can develop serious infections when they contract the fungus that causes PCP. This is most commonly seen in people who have HIV or AIDS. About 30% to 40%
of people with PCP have HIV or AIDS.
Other people who are at risk of PCP include people
:
with chronic lung disease
with cancer
who�ve had an organ transplant
who�ve had a stem cell transplant
with lupus and other autoimmune diseases
who take corticosteroids and other medications that lower their body�s immune system response
How common is Pneumocystis pneumonia?
There are no tracked statistics for PCP in the United States. Data from 2017 estimated that about 10,590 Americans
were hospitalized with PCP during that calendar year. But there aren�t overall statistics and data.
It�s known that before the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, PCP was extremely rare. During the height of the AIDS epidemic and before the development of today�s AIDS medications, around 75% of people with AIDS developed PCP.
These numbers have dropped in modern times, but PCP is still a concern for people with AIDS and other conditions that weaken their immune systems. PCP is also a concern in many countries around the world with developing healthcare systems.

Pneumocystis pneumonia,Pneumocystis pneumonia symptoms,"Symptoms of PCP are similar to symptoms of other types of pneumonia. They can include:
difficulty breathing
cough
fever
chills
chest pain
fatigue
It�s a good idea to contact a healthcare professional if you�re experiencing any of these symptoms, especially if you�ve had them for more than a few days.
How to prevent Pneumocystis pneumonia
Some people who are at high risk of PCP, such as people with HIV or AIDS or people who�ve received organ or stem cell transplants, might be prescribed medication to help prevent PCP.
Typically, this involves a medication called co-trimoxazole (TMX/SMX). You and a healthcare professional can discuss if preventive medication is right for you. There�s no vaccine to prevent PCP.

Pneumocystis pneumonia,Pneumocystis pneumonia diagnosis,"You�ll likely have a round of tests to confirm a diagnosis of PCP. This commonly includes:
Blood tests: Blood tests such as complete blood counts (CBCs) can help find your levels of white blood cells and can indicate an infection. Another blood test looks for a part of fungal cells called D-glucan.
Blood gas tests: You might have your arterial blood gas and venous blood gas taken to test the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood.
Sputum exam: A sputum exam tests mucus that you cough into a collection tube for PCP-causing fungus.
X-ray: An X-ray can take images of your chest and check for buildup in your lungs.
Bronchoscopy: A bronchoscopy is a test that uses a small and narrow tube called an endoscope that�s inserted into your airways to get a better look at inflammation and damage. It can provide sputum samples as well as biopsies.
Lung biopsy: During a lung biopsy, a piece of your lung tissue will be removed so that it can be tested in a lab."
Pneumocystis pneumonia,Pneumocystis pneumonia treatment,"PCP is a serious infection. People with PCP need medical treatment to resolve the infection. If PCP isn�t treated, it can be fatal.
Treatment for PCP most often involves co-trimoxazole medication given as oral medication or through an intravenous (IV) line. Typically, 3 weeks of treatment are required. Your healthcare team will be monitoring your progress closely, so be sure to ask them if you have any questions about your treatment for PCP.
You might also receive treatment to relieve your symptoms, such as medication to bring down fever, rehydration liquids, and pain-relieving medications.
Get involved
While we do have treatments for PCP, researchers are still looking to improve the process. If you�d like to get involved in the search for new and better treatments, check out ClinicalTrials.gov to see what studies are currently looking for participants.
Make sure to discuss any trials with a doctor or healthcare professional, especially if it will involve any changes to your current treatment regimen.

Pneumocystis pneumonia,Pneumocystis pneumonia treatment,"The exact cost for PCP treatment will depend on your insurance plan and on factors such as the brand of co-trimoxazole you receive, if you need additional treatments for symptoms, and if you need hospitalization.
Your deductible, copayments, and the other details of your insurance plan will also make a difference in your final price.
PCP has an umbrella International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) diagnostic billing code of B59. All treatments will fall under this code when they�re billed to your insurance. You can use this code to search your insurance coverage information to see what�s listed.
Your plan might specify that only certain medications and treatments are covered for PCP. Make sure to check with them for the most up-to-date information."
alcohol use disorder,alcohol use disorder definition,"Alcoholism, referred to as alcohol use disorder, occurs when someone drinks so much that their body eventually becomes dependent on or addicted to alcohol. There are different treatment plans available.
Alcoholism has been known by a variety of terms, including alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. Today, it�s referred to as alcohol use disorder.
People with alcohol use disorder will continue to drink even when drinking causes negative consequences, like losing a job or destroying relationships with people they love. They may know that their alcohol use negatively affects their lives, but it�s often not enough to make them stop drinking.
Some people may drink alcohol to the point that it causes problems, but they�re not physically dependent on alcohol. This used to be referred to as alcohol abuse."
alcohol use disorder,alcohol use disorder causes,"The cause of alcohol use disorder is still unknown. Alcohol use disorder develops when you drink so much that chemical changes in the brain occur. These changes increase the pleasurable feelings you get when you drink alcohol. This makes you want to drink more often, even if it causes harm.
Eventually, the pleasurable feelings associated with alcohol use go away and the person with alcohol use disorder will engage in drinking to prevent withdrawal symptoms. These withdrawal symptoms can be quite unpleasant and even dangerous.
Alcohol use disorder typically develops gradually over time. It�s also known to run in families."
alcohol use disorder,alcohol use disorder risks,"Although the exact cause of alcohol use disorder is unknown, there are certain factors that may increase your risk for developing this disease.
Known risk factors include having:
more than 15 drinks per week if you�re male
more than 12 drinks per week if you�re female
more than 5 drinks per day at least once a week (binge drinking)
a parent with alcohol use disorder
a mental health problem, such as depression, anxiety, or schizophrenia
You may also be at a greater risk for alcohol use disorder if you:
are a young adult experiencing peer pressure
have low self-esteem
experience a high level of stress
live in a family or culture where alcohol use is common and accepted
have a close relative with alcohol use disorder"
alcohol use disorder,alcohol use disorder symptoms,"Symptoms of alcohol use disorder are based on the behaviors and physical outcomes that occur as a result of alcohol addiction.
People with alcohol use disorder may engage in the following behaviors:
drinking alone
drinking more to feel the effects of alcohol (having a high tolerance)
becoming violent or angry when asked about their drinking habits
not eating or eating poorly
neglecting personal hygiene
missing work or school because of drinking
being unable to control alcohol intake
making excuses to drink
continuing to drink even when legal, social, or economic problems develop
giving up important social, occupational, or recreational activities because of alcohol use
People with alcohol use disorder may also experience the following physical symptoms:
alcohol cravings
withdrawal symptoms when not drinking, including shaking, nausea, and vomiting
tremors (involuntary shaking) the morning after drinking
lapses in memory (blacking out) after a night of drinking
illnesses, such as alcoholic ketoacidosis (includes dehydration-type symptoms) or cirrhosis"
alcohol use disorder,alcohol use disorder diagnosis,"Your doctor or healthcare provider can diagnose alcohol use disorder. They�ll do a physical exam and ask you questions about your drinking habits.
Your doctor may ask if you:
drive when you�re drunk
have missed work or have lost a job as a result of your drinking
need more alcohol to feel �drunk� when you drink
have experienced blackouts as a result of your drinking
have tried to cut back on your drinking but couldn�t
Your doctor may also use a questionnaire that assesses alcohol use disorder to help diagnose your condition.
Typically, a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder doesn�t require any other type of diagnostic test. There�s a chance your doctor may order blood work to check your liver function if you show signs or symptoms of liver disease.
Alcohol use disorder can cause serious and lasting damage to your liver. Your liver is responsible for removing toxins from your blood. When you drink too much, your liver has a harder time filtering the alcohol and other toxins from your bloodstream. This can lead to liver disease and other complications."
alcohol use disorder,alcohol use disorder prevention,"You can prevent alcohol use disorder by limiting your alcohol intake. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism
, women shouldn�t drink more than one drink per day, and men shouldn�t drink more than two drinks per day.
See your doctor if you begin to engage in behaviors that are signs of alcohol use disorder or if you think that you may have a problem with alcohol. You should also consider attending a local AA meeting or participating in a self-help program such as Women for Sobriety."
emotional lability,emotional lability definition,"Emotional liability is a neurological condition that causes uncontrollable laughing or crying, often at inappropriate times. It tends to affect people with preexisting neurological conditions or injuries.
You may a neurological condition known as emotional lability if you have uncontrollable laughing or crying, often at inappropriate times. It tends to affect people with preexisting neurological conditions or injuries.
It has many other names, including:
While the symptoms of emotional lability seem psychological, they�re actually a result of changes to the part of your brain that�s responsible for emotional control."
emotional lability,emotional lability symptoms,"The main symptoms of emotional lability are uncontrollable outbursts of crying or laughing. These outbursts are usually an exaggerated or inappropriately intense emotional reaction. They can also be completely unrelated to your current emotional state. For example, you might start laughing uncontrollably when you�re upset.
Other symptoms of emotional lability include:
short emotional outbursts that don�t last for more than a few minutes
mixed emotional outbursts, such as laughing that turns into crying
lack of emotional symptoms between episodes
laughing or crying in situations that other people don�t find funny or sad
emotional responses that are over-the-top for the situation
emotional outbursts that are very different from your usual behavior"
emotional lability,emotional lability causes,"In addition to strokes, neurological conditions and traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) can lead to emotional lability.
Common neurological conditions that can cause emotional lability include:
Alzheimer�s disease
dementia
multiple sclerosis (MS)
ALS (Lou Gehrig�s disease)
Types of TBIs that can cause emotional lability include:
blunt force head trauma
skull fracture
coup-countercoup injury
contusion
hematoma
laceration
penetrating injury
infection
brain swelling
oxygen deprivation"
emotional lability,emotional lability diagnosis,"Emotional lability is often misdiagnosed as depression or another mental health condition. To make getting a diagnosis easier, try to keep a journal of your symptoms, including when they occur and how long they last. If possible, note your general mood and emotional state between outbursts. If you don�t notice any emotional symptoms between episodes, it�s a good indicator that you likely have emotional lability, rather than a psychological condition.
Make sure to tell your doctor about any recent head injuries or underlying conditions. You might also find it helpful to bring along a loved one who�s observed your emotional outbursts.
While there�s no specific test for diagnosing emotional lability, your doctor will ask you a series of questions about your medical history and moods to confirm the diagnosis."
bedsore,bedsore definition,"A decubitus ulcer is also known as a pressure ulcer, pressure sore, or bedsore. It�s an open wound on your skin caused by a long period of constant pressure to a specific area of the body. Decreased blood flow to these areas leads to tissue damage and death.
Decubitus ulcers often occur on the skin covering bony areas. The most common places for a decubitus ulcer are your:
This condition is common among people who are older and people who have decreased mobility. Left untreated, infections can spread to the blood, heart, and bones and become life threatening.
But it�s important to know that bedsores can be treated. An individual�s outlook depends on several factors, including underlying medical conditions as well as the stage of the ulcer."
bedsore,bedsore symptoms,"Each stage of a decubitus ulcer has different symptoms. Depending on the stage, you may have any of the following:
skin discoloration
pain, itching, or burning in the affected area
open skin
skin that doesn�t lighten to the touch
skin that�s softer or firmer than the surrounding skin
necrosis, or dead tissue that appears black
The sore may also be infected. Symptoms of infection include:
redness or discoloration surrounding the sore
pus or green-colored drainage
a foul smell
fever"
bedsore,bedsore causes,"Prolonged pressure is essentially the main cause of a decubitus ulcer. Lying on a certain part of your body for long periods causes your skin to break down. The areas around the hips, heels, and tailbone are especially vulnerable to these types of sores.
Other factors that increase the odds of experiencing a bedsore include:
poor circulation
excessive moisture
skin irritants like urine and feces
friction, such as when a person who is confined to bed has sheets dragged from under them"
bedsore,bedsore risks,"You may be at greater risk of decubitus ulcers if you:
are confined to bed following surgery or illness
can�t move or change positions by yourself while lying in bed or sitting in a wheelchair
are over 70 years old, as older adults are more likely to have fragile skin and mobility difficulties
smoke
have obesity
don�t get enough nutrients in your diet, which may influence the condition of your skin
have urinary or bowel incontinence
have chronic conditions that can restrict your blood circulation or limit your mobility, such as:
diabetes
atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries)
heart failure
kidney failure
Parkinson�s disease
multiple sclerosis"
bedsore,bedsore diagnosis,"Your healthcare professional may refer you to a wound care team of doctors, specialists, and nurses experienced in treating pressure sores. The team may evaluate your ulcer based on several factors, including:
the size and depth of your ulcer
the type of tissue directly affected by your ulcer, such as skin, muscle, or bone
the color of the skin affected by your ulcer
the amount of tissue death that occurs from your ulcer
the condition of your ulcer, such as presence of infection, strong odor, or bleeding
Your healthcare professional may take a biopsy, or sample of the fluids and tissue in your decubitus ulcer, and send it to a lab for testing."
bedsore,bedsore treatment,"Your treatment will depend on the stage and condition of your ulcer. Repositioning frequently and keeping the site clean, dry, and free of irritants is important to promote healing.
Treatment may include:
treatment of any infection that is present, which may include:
antibiotic cream
oral antibiotics
intravenous (IV) antibiotics
local wound care, including specific cleaning and dressing recommendations
using special bandages that help remove dead tissue
medication to relieve or reduce any discomfort
debridement, which removes dead or infected tissue
repositioning frequently
reducing friction and moisture in the location
using special off-loading cushions to reduce pressure on the sore
surgery
Stage 3 and 4 ulcers are more likely to require surgical debridement and negative pressure wound therapy. Chronic deep ulcers may be difficult to treat.
Your treatment strategy depends on several factors. Your doctor will discuss the best options for your specific ulcer.

bedsore,bedsore prevention,"Your doctor or a physical therapist can make recommendations to reduce the likelihood of experiencing bedsores. They may recommend:
changing positions in bed at least every 2 hours
if you use a wheelchair, aiming to:
sit upright
shift your sitting position every 15 minutes
use a cushion that redistributes your weight
regularly checking your skin for signs of pressure sores, if you�re hospitalized or otherwise immobilized
